Two cavaliers appear, and the Devil takes the form of a seer, old, bent and wrinkled. Then he disappears in a cloud of smoke, to reappear shortly as a ghost, whose head comes off and floats around the room. Suddenly the table gets up of itself, and flies up the chimney. All sorts of wonderful things happen. A cannon takes the place occupied by the table, and belches forth flame and smoke. A large cage appears mysteriously in the center of the room, through the bars of which the Devil passes as if it were an open door.

Suddenly, in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears and surprises the astronomer. At the command of the Fairy Queen, who suddenly appears, Satan vanishes; she awakens the astronomer and as he goes forward to meet her she disappears. The astronomer is very much excited, and, rushing over to the large telescope he tries to discover by what means she had vanished. The moon now appears, and begins her repast by eating the immense telescope used by the astronomer. The astronomer flies around apparently wild at the loss of his wonderful telescope. Suddenly the moon opens wide her mouth and there comes forth a tot of about five summers. She is immediately followed by two others, and they proceed to dance around the astronomer, and vanish one at a time until but one is left. The astronomer, picking her up, thinking he could keep her, hugs her tightly in his arms, but she also vanishes. Tired and heart-broken the astronomer grasps a broom and attempts to strike the moon, when she suddenly vanishes and in the distance laughs at him, rolling his eyes forward and backward, apparently convulsed with laughter. The moon suddenly changes to a crescent, and a fairy appears sitting on it. The veiled figure which stands before him throws back its veil and becomes animated; he rushes forward and grasps it, when, to his utter amazement, it disappears in the air. The Fairy Queen appears in the crescent. She first seats herself, and the astronomer puts his arms out for her, thinking perhaps he can reach her, when she disappears and in her place there stands a marble statue of a man. The astronomer, in his efforts to reach her falls to the ground. Rising and seeing the statue he is so incensed that he grabs a club, and as he is about to crush the statue it suddenly becomes alive. The large moon again appearing to his view he throws himself into it, and the moon, winking one eye, proceeds to chew him up. The moon's large teeth are seen to sink into the astronomer again and again until he is reduced to small pieces, when piece by piece he is ejected from the moon's mouth and lies there, one piled on the other. Suddenly in a cloud of smoke, Satan appears, but the Fairy Queen drives him off again. She proceeds to pick up different parts of the astronomer and hurls them across the room, and piece by piece they take their proper position in the chair, until the astronomer is again seated as he was before. Suddenly he comes to life again. He moves forward to grasp the Fairy Queen, when suddenly she disappears. The scene is again laid in the astronomer's observatory, the astronomer sitting at the table, asleep over his volume, which he has been studying."	N/A	France	N/A	2015-02-12 04:21:27.143000000

His little bunch of whiskers that adorn his chin seem to be as proud of him as his Melindy Jane, whom he left in Grassville, back over yonder. He is finally undressed and tumbles into bed, resolving meanwhile to dream of the good prices he will realize in his produce. While pondering over matters, he looks around and discovers a Ghost standing in the middle of the room. Silas becomes scared, begosh, and leaping out on the floor begs the Ghost to do him no harm. The Ghost suddenly vanishes and the Hayseed is about to jump into bed again when Satan appears from under the sheets and scares him to such an extent that he is willing to promise him even a box of fresh rooster eggs if he will only go away. But his Satanic Majesty says 'nit,' and he is almost frantic.

He has just finished his meal and the waiter brings a glass of beer, and when he places the glass upon the table, lo, a little sailor boy about six inches high appears from the foam, and climbing down the side of the glass, proceeds to dance a sailor's hornpipe on the table. The sailor then walks toward a large cake of cheese, which is really higher than himself, and from the wedge shaped opening which has been cut, produces a little lady of his own height, with whom he holds a very animated conversation to the great delight of the diner. Another little man appears on the scene, and everything goes smoothly until a quarrel arises among the little people. The picture finishes in an exciting manner, by the sailor and the lady's escort having a lively mix-up. This is one of the most comical effects ever produced in animated photography.

We begin by showing the complete circus parade as it takes place in the street. The first scene shows the parade coming down a broad asphalt avenue with park in background. Entire parade shows elephants, camels, band wagons, chariots, cages of animals, and full circus paraphernalia, making a most interesting subject. The next picture shows the assembly or grand entry, and includes the entrance into the arena of the elephants, chariots, wild animals, horses, camels, etc. We next show an exciting horse race, consisting of eight horses, on which are mounted an Indian, a squaw, a Filipino girl, an Arab woman, an Arab, a cowboy and an English jockey and an American jockey. The picture concludes with a bareback team race. In this race two horses are abreast, the driver standing up, with one foot resting on one horse and one upon the other. They make two circuits of the ring and furnish a very exciting climax to the picture. We conclude the Day at the Circus Series with a fifty-foot picture, showing a very exciting chariot race. Two chariots appear in the race, one drawn by four white horses and the other by four bay horses.	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:15:59.727000000

Just as he draws back from the uncanny object, the doors of a mediaeval wardrobe fly back and a hand prods him with a sword. He turns to confront his assailant when it vanishes, and at the same instant the skull flies to the other end of the room. He clutches at the skull, when it turns into the half form of a girl from the waist up, suspended in mid-air. As he gazes in amusement, the other half of the girl, fully dressed from her waist down, walks across the room, and the two halves of the figure join, making a girl complete. In an amorous fashion the old man folds his arms around the girl's waist with the intention of stealing a kiss, but the girl immediately changes into an old woman, who grins in evident delight at the old man's discomfort. In great anger he throws her into the wardrobe and locks the door. Unseen by him, the woman has again become a girl. A great effect is here produced. Through the doors, which are solid and closed, the form of the girl appears through the woodwork. Hastily opening the door, the old man is then confronted by an Egyptian mummy. Other strange things happen. As the pawnbroker flies from the room a large and grotesque head arises from the smoke and slowly advances toward the spectators. Larger and larger the head grows until it fills the entire picture, and appears as though it would swallow the whole audience. A most laughable and mystifying scene.

From this most simple tale we have produced a play that is both pleasing and amusing to young and old, introducing as we do many surprising tricks and dissolving effects. We have followed as near as possible the tale of Perrault, which is well known to all, and which has been translated into all languages. We have, on account of the peculiar effects that must be introduced in animated pictures, arranged it also with humorous features, without which it would not have been so highly interesting and pleasing as a motion picture demonstration of the fairy tale. The story itself is doubtless familiar to many of our customers, and we will, therefore, not attempt to describe it in our catalogue matter, except to state that it is composed of the finest trick and dissolving effects ever introduced, and that the action is replete from start to finish with humorous, emotional and spectacular situations.

The scene opens in the bedroom of a hotel. A traveler appears, evidently a "little worse for wear." After stretching and yawning, he proceeds to disrobe. He throws off his coat and vest, but to his surprise and anguish, he suddenly finds himself clothed in a continental uniform. He throws this off in anger, but immediately a policeman's costume flies on him. This is in turn thrown aside in great rage and he finds himself clothed in a soldier's uniform. At last, thinking himself successful, he makes for the bed and finds a skeleton complacently resting on his pillow. The bed suddenly disappears, leaving him seated on the floor, and great quantities of bed clothes rain down from the ceiling. The picture ends leaving the audience simply convulsed in laughter.

Armitage	N/A	N/A	N/A	6.8	549	N/A	Time-lapse photography is used to show the manual dismantling and demolition of New York's Star Theatre over a period of about 30 days.	This film shows the demolition of the historic Star Theatre building (formerly Wallack's) at the corner of Broadway and 13th Street, New York. To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.	N/A	USA	1 win.	2015-01-18 00:48:10.903000000

Satan, who has made his way into the chateau, puts the seven bags in a strong box, and makes with his hands some cabalistic motions. The miser comes into the hall and is greatly astonished to find his fortune missing. He opens the coffer and immediately the bags leap out. He gathers them up and puts them back into the coffer. When he opens it again he finds that they have been transformed into seven young girls, who rush out and chase after him, beating him unmercifully. They shut him up in the coffer from which his gold has vanished. The miser pushes open the lid of the coffer, and to his profound despair finds that both young girls and money have disappeared.

A juggler summons two chairs, which come to the stage jumping and twirling around. Across the back of these chairs the operator places a sheet of glass on which he lays a box about four inches high. He then takes a table cover, with his servant's help, rolls it up and from the centre emerges a lady, beautifully dressed. At the juggler's order she jumps in the box, in which she completely disappears. The operator, in taking the box, notices an incredulous smile among the audience; he then affirms that the lady is still inside, and to prove it he puts the box on his knees and the girl appears again in full figure. He makes her go in again, and opening the box he shows that the girl has vanished and that her dresses only remain at the bottom. Then he jumps into the box himself, and his servant afterward; the box rolls off the stage without any help.	N/A	France	N/A	2014-09-05 00:19:39.883000000

Being in need of two pages, he brings them out of his coat, and with rope he makes a hoop. The two pages stretch out a large sheet of white paper. The musketeer puts the hoop through the paper, and instantly the hoop is all covered with paper like those used by performers in the circus. The pages hold up the hoop; the paper bursts, only to let out a hideous clown, who goes and sits in the corner to see what is going to happen. Then the musketeer breaks the hoop, takes out of his hat a lot of flowers, which he throws on the pieces of the hoop, and by his act he makes a lovely wreath, from which appears a beautiful woman. This woman is then substituted by an immense and grinning face, into which the clown jumps. Then an explosion is heard and nothing is left of the clown nor the head. The musketeer takes the pages on his soldiers, one after the other, and they are changed as his coat and hat. Finally he disappears in a most mysterious way.

An Indian maiden helps him make his escape.	This subject is a production upon which was spent a great deal of time and money. It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, "Kit Carson," his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-24 00:43:26.533000000

Here we see in the midst of a primeval forest, a little clearing and the rude log-house erected by the sturdy frontiersman. A little girl leaves the cabin, and tripping daintily along the forest path in her bare feet, goes to a neighboring spring for water. What she sees lurking in the shadowy thickets causes her to fly back to the cabin for her life. She has no sooner passed the threshold, slamming the door behind her, when a half dozen painted Indians burst into view in close pursuit. Immediately the long rifle-barrel of the pioneer protrudes from a loophole in the cabin wall. It speaks, and a savage leaps into the air and falls clutching the sod. The other Indians slink back, only to reappear an instant later crawling through the grass like snakes and pushing bundles of dry limbs and grass before them. The settler's rifle speaks again and again, but the savages succeed in pushing the combustible material against the house, and in an instant it is fiercely blazing. AN INDIAN MASSACRE [BURNING OF THE CABIN AND MURDER OF THE SETTLERS]. A little girl runs in with the alarm. The door is quickly locked and barred and the long rifle appears at the loop-hole and is frequently fired. The Indians gradually close in on the ill-fated home, and finally have it ablaze from a fire of brushwood. The Indians, now in a frenzy over the success of their fiendish enterprise, procure a log and using it as a battering ram they hurl themselves upon the door and batter it in. The pioneer rushes out to defend his loved ones, but he is quickly overcome and tomahawked, and his wife as quickly meets the same fate. The little girl, terror-stricken by the awful scenes she has witnessed, is seized by the savages and carried off a prisoner. THE OATH! [DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES] In the next scene all that is left of the cabin is a smoldering ruin. A company of trappers come rapidly out of the forest and discover the bodies of the unfortunate man and woman. With bared heads, and in most impressive fashion they register an oath never to rest until they have wreaked vengeance on the Indian murderers and rescued the child. THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL [CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN]. A magnificent scene showing the savages leading their captive along a winding path on the mountain-side. The little girl sagaciously leaves a trail by tearing a bit from her dress. The trappers following shortly after discover the clue and press on in pursuit, encouraged by the knowledge that the girl is probably still living. VENGEANCE [RESCUE OF THE CHILD FROM THE INDIANS]. The Indians come to their evening camp by the side of a forest stream. After a drink of clear water, they tie the little girl to a tree and prepare for their night's rest. The trappers are close upon them however, and with a wild yell the white men hurl themselves upon the Indians. A terrific hand-to-hand combat ensues, and the Indians are slain remorselessly. The little girl is quickly released from her bonds and, as the picture ends, she is in the arms of one of the brave trappers who have rescued her. All of the scenes in this great production were made amidst the wildest and most beautiful scenery of the Adirondack Mountains, and the subject is one which will appeal strongly to all classes of people.

Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing.	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-12-13 00:00:20.047000000

Not only is it a film about a dog it is also a film about the kidnaping of a young baby by an old woman. With these two classical Hollywood ingredients and some stunning dialogue, (It's silent!), Rescued by Rover really hits a nerve. The repeated shots provide some interest in what, surprisingly, is an entertaining example of early cinema, canine heroics and a man wearing mascara.	N/A	UK	N/A	2014-10-24 00:40:57.297000000

According to the rapid strides that electricity is making in this wonderful age we are not surprised to see in this picture an ideal hotel of the future in which everything is done by electricity. We see a couple entering the hostelry and, after registering, the clerk touches a button and away goes the baggage on to the elevator, which stops at the proper floors and the grips enter the room without the aid of anyone. Many amusing incidents follow. Finally they pay the penalty for all the latest improvements, for something goes wrong with the electric plant in the cellar and mixes the whole place up. We see all the furnishings start to turn in all directions and the unfortunate guests find themselves in the midst of the affray. They manage to get to the door and are tumbled out and rolled across the street till out of the reach of the magnetic force, where they pick up their belongings and hurry home, vowing never to enter another electric hotel.

The opening shows a colored nursemaid in the park with baby carriage, and seated on a bench receives the attention of several smart colored men who admire her greatly and endeavor to make her acquaintance. But the dusky belle is coy and declines to make the acquaintance of any of them, until one more fortunate than the rest is invited to a seat on the bench with her, and a most pronounced flirtation takes place between the lady and her beau. The course of true love seems to run smoothly, and we are next introduced to the lady's home, where the young man is paying a visit and is introduced by the girl to her, father and mother, typical old darkies of before the war time, and several funny scenes follow in which the kid hint her plays a prominent part. The coon favors his girl with many presents and lavishes attentions upon her, although it cannot he said that the courtship proceeds altogether without incident. A rival appears on the scene, razors are drawn and finally a duel is arranged, at which both suitors, accompanied by their seconds, appear on the field of honor and exchange shots at thirty paces; one of the combatants is carried off the field, while our original hero remains the master of the situation, and the girl, arriving at the moment, is so pleased with his valor that arrangements for the wedding are made at once. The happy climax is reached at last and the marriage ceremony makes the two coons one and ends the "wooing" in a wedding. Next is seen the home of the young couple, but quite a change has taken place. No longer does the colored gallant overwhelm his lady with presents and similar attentions. Put the familiar sign of "Washing Done Here" is apparent, and while the woman toils at the wash tub the married coon smokes, drinks and enjoys himself at his leisure until he decides to go out and enjoy the sights and pleasures of the town. In turn he visits a trap game and several other gambling scenes, not forgetting various saloons, at which he accumulates a very perceptible package. His gambling experience has been unsuccessful and he loses not only his money but his clothes as well, and finally is compelled to rob a scarecrow in order to get clothes enough to get home again at all, which he finally gains in a very disheveled and ragged condition. The unfortunate coon has not been home long before he is attacked by imaginary foes as the result of his drinking bout; seizing a broom he gives battle wildly but is surprised by his wife, who, disgusted with the condition in which her husband has returned, attacks him viciously and gives him the beating he so richly deserves and ends by throwing a tub of suds and dirty water all over him.

The scene opens with an assembly of citizens who are harangued by one of their number, whose words have great weight with the crowd, and their attitude of approval shows that Roman misrule in Jerusalem has reached its climax. Heralds now approach and Roman soldiers beat back the crowd to make way for the approach of the Roman Procurator. The scene changes to the home of Ben Hur, who is seen with his sister and mother on the house top. The cavalcade of Roman troops approaches, and to get a near view Ben Hur leans from the coping and knocks down one of the stones thereof onto the shoulder of the Procurator. This is seen and misconstrued by the Governor, who orders soldiers to arrest the inmates; they, after ineffectual pleas and struggles, are carried off. Ben Hur is consigned to the galleys, where he is loaded with chains. Here he signalizes himself by saving the life of Arrias, who publicly adopts him as his son and proclaims him a Roman citizen amidst the acclamations of the assembled crowd in the forum. Now comes the scene in the games where Ben Hur is challenged by Messala, and accepts it, to the great delight of the citizens. The chariots and athletes parade before the dais and in due time are arranged, and the chariot race commences. Three times 'round the ring dash the chariots, and at the fourth turn Ben Hur comes out the victor and is crowned with the wreath, to the great, chagrin of Messala, who is borne on a stretcher, wounded to death.

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: "I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me." Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: "All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard." One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face. Only once more the lovers meet again, at Marguerite's deathbed. Her only comfort is that Armand's father regrets his hard-heartedness and gives Armand permission to go back to her. He arrives just in time to see her die happy. (886 feet)	N/A	Denmark	N/A	2014-11-18 00:40:14.453000000

The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a "line of sweetness long drawn out." Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a "Louis Quinze." The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, "O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for "blues" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit.

In this Great Northern film is shown the tapering spires of a beautiful castle reflected in the quiet water, while the park's trimmed hedges are stretching themselves across the landscape, hiding and shading what is inside from the curious gaze. The old nobleman wants to give a banquet in order to celebrate his daughter's betrothal to a rich old man of noble family. But his young and pretty daughter wants to have a younger and handsomer bridegroom, and therefore one can easily understand that she refuses the old suitor when the father introduces him to her. In the moonlight the young people meet and talk over their future prospects. He seems to feel inclined to give up the struggle and go away, but she is made of a sterner stuff and tries to prevent him in his intentions. As good luck would have it, the betrothal feast is to be held in the park by the seashore, and here Providence provides the accident which unites the two. The two rivals quarrel about a rose and the old gentleman settles the quarrel by saying that his daughter is to throw the rose into the water, and the one who fetches it up again shall have not only the rose but also the hand of his beautiful daughter and shall become the future owner of her magnificent castle home. In a second the young man is in the water, and while the spectators are shouting with joy he reaches the rose, which he at once offers to the fair judge. The old suitor has to acknowledge his adversary's strength and courage, and congratulates the two young people and withdraws his suit in favor of his successful rival.

A talented youth has compounded a wonderful fluid, a little of which he applies to the mirror in his room, and when he looks into it his image comes to life and comes out of the frame and imitates his every action. As soon as he rubs the fluid off the mirror his double disappears. When the servant come in, a little of the fluid is again rubbed on the mirror, and he has the same experience, his reflection stepping out and doing stunts, thereby scaring the poor fellow almost to death. The inventor of the fluid then takes the mirror with him and goes out on the street, a passing policeman looks into it, and immediately his double appears and they have a free-for-all fight. A fellow playing the hose on the street is surprised when his double faces him, also holding a hose, and for a time it is amusing to see them drenching one another. He next goes into a café, where a man seated at a table gazes into the mirror, and immediately his double appears on the opposite side of the table, and it is nip and tuck to see who can eat the most. They cause so much excitement in the place that everything is wrecked and the unfortunate fellow is unceremoniously ejected, while his double disappears. The young inventor goes home, but is followed by an angry mob, who procure a vat and give him an undesired bath, and in the midst of the excitement the young student of chemicals awakens and finds that it is only a dream.

Armand at once falls in love with her, and as Marguerite is taken ill during the dancing, he is the only one who is taking care of her. In the second act the two have grown more familiar, although Marguerite has not quite given up her old acquaintances. One day, for instance, Armand has to leave her for the sake of a count, who has invited her for a drive. From the street Armand has watched the count's visit, and in a fit of passionate jealousy, he writes a letter to Marguerite, saying: "I have seen the count enter your place. You must choose between him and me." Marguerite's friend gives her the letter. One minute later the agreement is made, and the count drives off alone. The lovers now go into the country to live in an unpretending villa, where they are enjoying their happiness as a young married couple. Armand's money does not suffice, and quite secretly Marguerite sells her horses, carriage and jewelry. One day Prudence comes out to Marguerite to help her to dispose of some of the jewelry, and now Armand learns how matters stand. At once he starts off for Paris in order to procure money. During his absence his father arrives and tries to induce Marguerite to give up Armand. He succeeds, and for the sake of Armand's future she promises to go away, and only to leave a letter, in which she says: "All must be over, but whatever happens do not condemn me too hard." One year later the two meet again in a gambling house. Very much excited, Armand starts gambling with Marguerite's new lover and wins from him again and again. When all the gamblers have left the hall, Marguerite remains, calls Armand and tries to explain the matter to him, but he gets into a perfect rage, throws her down on the floor and in front of all the people he flings her a heap of money in the face.

The fact that they have been able to keep themselves innocent in spite of all temptation, as well as their beautiful appearance and winning ways, has drawn Baron d'Alroys' attention to them. He is paying special attention to Kitty, and as she is unable to conceal the passionate love she is bearing towards the Baron, it is not surprising that the Baron, one evening as he is fetching the two sisters from the music-hall in his motor-car, asks Kitty to marry him. Neither the sad circumstances in Kitty's home nor the obstacles which his family and friends of rank try to throw into his way, in order to make him give up this marriage, can induce him to desist from his purpose. He keeps his word and marries Kitty. Two years later we find a happy home; a sweet little girl seems to be an inviolable tie between man and wife in this unequal marriage. The idyll is interrupted by a servant, who is bringing instructions for the Baron to go to the colonial forces in Africa. With anxious forebodings for the future, man and wife part, he to face a precarious destiny, and she to spend many a sad and lonely day with her haughty mother-in-law. We see the Baron again at the head of the van, marching into the enemy's country. With a few of his men he falls in an ambush and is severely hurt. Another officer succeeds in getting away unhurt, but as he has seen the Baron falling without rising again, he supposes him to be dead and takes the sad message to his unhappy wife, as he a little later on is going home on leave of absence. The blow is terrible to the young wife; she has not only lost her husband, as far as she knows, but the mother-in-law now turns her away from the home. Kitty has now to endure much evil from her drunken father and her now so flighty sister. Her little girl is her only comfort. One fine day the old Baroness comes to visit her. She wants to take the child away from her. During the conflict which is now taking place between the two women. Baron d'Alroys himself, all alive, makes his appearance. Now matters are changed about. Kitty gets reparation for her misfortune and the wicked mother-in-law is unmercifully turned out. The Baron embraces his two beloved ones, as if he would never part from them again.

He is persistent in his suit for her hand, but outside of a seemingly cordial friendship the lady apparently does not return his affections. There is a reason for this. Osman Bey, a Turkish nobleman, desires the hand of this charming girl. He has expressed his love for her to her father, who is an ambitious, worldly man and who aspires to obtain that social recognition which is so dear to the average man of wealth. Mons. Dupont is well aware that he is selling his daughter, and so cleverly does he arrange matters by pretending that he is facing financial ruin, that he persuades Flora into giving her consent to the marriage in order to save his credit. Several months later, whilst sightseeing in Constantinople, Jack by accident meets Flora, who is driving in a closed vehicle. He is startled at the change in her appearance and indignant over the revelation of her misery and ill-treatment. Almost a prisoner in the house of Osman Bey, she is denied friends and relatives. Her one great desire now is to get away from her tyrannical and brutal husband. Jack determines to aid her, and tells her that he will gain admittance to the grounds of the palace after sundown, where he may talk with her and if possible formulate a plan whereby she may gain her freedom. True to his word Jack is on hand at the appointed time, but is unable to pass the guards at the gate. Nothing daunted, this daring American determines to scale the massive walls, which he does after a great deal of difficulty. Making his way through the beautiful gardens, he manages to see through a lighted window Flora's face and form, Gently tapping on the pane of glass her attention is attracted, but a female spy, ordered by Osman Bey to keep an eye on his wife, observes the signal from the window and immediately acquaints her master with the knowledge of his wife's indiscretion. Burning with rage, the infuriated husband summons his slaves and orders them to take the American prisoner. Jack has just greeted Flora, when he is startled by a sharp word of command, and turning suddenly he is seized by the stalwart slaves of the palace and dragged away. Flora appeals to her enraged husband for Jack's release, taking all the blame on herself, but to no avail. The prisoner is carried to an underground dungeon, where he is left to ponder over the perplexing situation in which he now finds himself. Maddened by grief, the poor girl determines in her desperation to go to the Sultan and beg his clemency. Escaping from her chamber window she makes her way to the Sultan's palace, and gaining admittance is granted an audience by his majesty. Struck by her beauty and fired by the crafty thought that he might gain this helpless woman for his harem, he promises her the pardon, but instead of letting her take it he dispatches one of his officers with the papers, at the same time commanding the bewildered Flora to remain at his palace. How Jack is led out to execution and how the pardon arrives just in time to save his life, much to the chagrin of Osman Bey, is all vividly shown. Jack has learned of Flora's detention in the Sultan's palace, and so embittered is he at this outrage that he joins the cause of the revolutionists. The last scenes of the picture show the attack on the Sultan's palace, and the meeting of Osman Bey and Jack in a hand to hand conflict in which the Turk is bested, which is followed by the rescue of Flora and the capture of the despised Sultan.

In a strange grotto deep in the bowels of the earth a coffin uprights itself, dances, then opens, and out steps a demonic magician with skeletal face, horns, and cape. He wraps two women (who appear to be in a trance) in fabric, levitates them, and causes them to burst into flames and disappear. As he gathers their ashes in a pitcher a Good Spirit [a young woman who resembles Peter Pan] appears, shakes her head No, and reveals the "souls" of the two women in a secret compartment deeper within the cave. The Good Spirit vanishes in a puff of smoke. The magician then produces 3 glass bottles on pillars, takes them downstage close to the camera, and reveals 3 tiny women in them; one woman beats a tambourine while the other two sway. The magician pours ashes (?) into the bottles, but the Good Spirit reappears and makes these trapped figures disappear in a flash, angering the magician, who chases her away. He makes an easel appear. There is an odd sort of screen on it bearing the Pathe rooster logo. The magician then invents channel-surfing, causing three different "shows" to appear on the screen in rapid succession. The Good Spirit reappears and causes this strange television set to vanish, but the magician creates two more in turn, each more elaborate than the last, with various images of persons and dogs flashing across their screens. Finally, the Good Spirit reveals to the evil magician an area within the cave where there are four pillars and a tableau of distinguished-looking ladies (goddesses?). She takes the magician downstage, forces him to the ground, pours a pitcher of something on him (ashes? Holy water?) and turns him into a lifeless skeleton, which she reveals to the camera.

Hunting scenes have ever been a leading feature in motion pictures since their inception, and the Biograph here presents a most thrilling series, a Caribou Hunt in the Barrens of Newfoundland. It starts with a scene showing the hunting party leaving Portland, Me., by train. They arrive at Millertown, N.F, where they are met by the guides, and from here the journey is made in canoes. Next is shown real camp life in the wilderness. The hunters start out in pursuit of the fleet-footed game, of which many are seen at remarkably close range. Several caribou are shot and taken in the course of the hunt. The excitement reaches a climax when one of the animals is run to the beach, and as he stands sniffing the air, a well-directed shot takes effect. Leaping forward, he plunges into the water, but a second shot follows and the magnificent caribou becomes the sportsman's trophy. This film is unquestionably an interesting hunting picture.

Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific ...	John Davis, first mate of the brig "Gifford," is seen bidding his wife and infant child a tearful adieu on the eve of the sailing of his ship. Caught in a terrible storm in the Pacific Ocean, the vessel is wrecked and all on board are supposed to have been drowned, at least so the newspapers chronicled. What a blow this was to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, still she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, "Robinson Crusoe," for he at least enjoyed the companionship of "Friday," but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child. He at once concludes that he has been forgotten and his place taken by his friend. His soul is at first filled with revenge and he is about to strike Foster down, but no, she is happy. She thinks him dead, and why not let it be so? This would be the most kindly, so he slinks hack into the foliage, intending to go away forever. They pass into the house, leaving the little one playing on the lawn. He cannot resist folding the child his child to his heart. From her he learns the truth as the mother returns from the house, and two faithful souls are "once more united never to part."	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-19 00:13:10.060000000

The daughter of a staid New England minister is brought up in absolute ignorance of the ways of the outside world, and, when she gets the slightest inkling of its glamour, it makes a decided impression. Into her hands have fallen several theatrical newspapers, and she and her girl chum eagerly digest their contents, recounting in glowing terms what seems to be a golden existence. So wrought up were they that they immediately give vent to their ebullient spirits by indulging in a quasi-dramatic performance. This is a scene of broad burlesque, and, during its enaction, the minister enters and is greatly shocked, not to say incensed. A stormy scene occurs between him and his daughter, which ends with her leaving home. She applies for a position in the chorus of a New York opera company. What a contrast she makes at the trial of voices, but with determination she pulls through the ordeal and is accepted. Owing to her sweet face and manners, together with a beautiful voice, her rise in the profession is rapid. Still, she has found that all is not gold that glitters, and while her artistic success is most agreeable, life for her is empty, cold and cheerless, made more odious by the appearance of the inevitable vile, flattering tempter. Numerous letters has she written to her dear old father, but no response, for he has torn them into shreds before he even broke the seal. "Oh, God, if I could only go back. If this all would prove but a dream." But, no, there is the dark fathomless future before her. The tempter would have her go with him, and there seems to be no alternative. She is now surely at the crossroads of life. She makes a final appeal to her father in a telegram begging him to come to see her performance on the night following, which he does. Down the aisle of the theater comes the old minister in bewilderment, so unaccustomed is he to the surroundings, as through the peekhole in the curtain drops the girl views the scene in ecstasy. After the performance the old man makes his way to the back of the stage, where he once more folds his daughter to his heart, while her would-be lover views the scene with unconcealed chagrin. The story is a most touching one.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-01 00:03:55.240000000

Her one hobby was to possess a hubby. Many there were whom she tried to hook, but in vain, for truth to say. Arte was of pulchritude a bit shy. She had the complexion of pale rhubarb and a figure like a wheat sack. Still her motto was "nil desperandum," and she was ever hopeful. One thing in her favor, her father. Obediah Stebbins, avowed his aid. Of the visitors who called at the Stebbins' domicile, Hezekiah Horubeak seemed the most probable to corral, so Artemisia set to work. Hez at first was a trifle recalcitrant, but was soon subdued by Obediah's gun, which we must admit possessed egregious powers of persuasion. The day for the wedding was set, and to the village church there flocked the natives to witness this momentous affair. All was progressing serenely until the all-important question was put to Hezekiah, and instead of answering "Yea," he kicked over the trace and tried to beat it. His escape by way of the door was intercepted, so it happens that the little church is in sore need of a stained glass window, for Hez took a portion of it with him in his haste. Out and over the lawn he gallops with the congregation at his heels, Artemisia Sophia well in the lead. Down from the terrace onto the road they leap and across the meadow until they come to a fence, on the other side of which are two boys shooting crap. Over this hurdle they vault coming plump down on the poor boys, almost crushing the life out of them. Regaining his equilibrium, Hez forges on coming to the very acropolis of the town. The descent therefrom is decidedly precipitous and makes Hez hesitate for a moment, but only a moment, for the howling horde is still in pursuit, so down be goes in leaps and falls to the bottom, followed by a veritable avalanche of human beings. Owing to this mix-up Hez has a chance to distance them a little, and being almost exhausted, he attempts to climb a tree, but too late for the gang is soon upon him, and carry him back to the church where the ceremony is started again, and when he is asked that all-important question he fairly yells, "Yes, b'gosh!" Artemisia is now asked the question, and to the amazement of all present she says, "Not on your county fair tintype," and flounces haughtily out of the church, leaving poor Hezekiah in a state of utter collapse, surrounded by sympathizing friends.

The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening.

One night while performing, the mother has a vision of her child dying. She rushes home, but it is too late.	Mrs. Bailey, the young widowed mother of a child, now ill, and with but faint chance of recovery, must undergo the torture of smilingly responding to the generous plaudits of a thoughtless throng at the theater, while her heart is torn with anguish that only a mother can appreciate, for "Earth holds no symbol, has no living sign to image forth a mother's deathless love." 'Tis the opening night of a big production at the opera house, and at eight o'clock we still find the distracted actress in her humble apartment bending over the wan figure of her little one, while her own mother stands by in mute distress. A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:28.160000000

During the evening bridge participated in by a number of the guests, among whom is Myrtle Vane. Miss Vane is playing in wretched luck, and is advised several times by Mrs. Wharton to desist, but she still plays on in the vain hopes of the tide of fortune turning, until at last, in the extreme of desperation, she stakes her all and loses. Shame and disgrace stare her in the face. What can she do to recoup her depleted fortune? As one of the guests there is Professor Francois Paracelsus, the eminent palmister, who of course, was called upon to read the palms of those present. Sheets of paper were prepared and each imprinted their hand on a sheet to be read by the erudite soothsayer at his leisure, and so were left on the drawing room table. All have now retired to the apartments assigned them by Mrs. Wharton, but there seems to be a sleepless night before Myrtle, and she suffers mental agony, until the thought of the necklace flashes before her mind's eye. 0, if she only possessed those treasures all would be well. The more she thought of it the more unconquerable became her covetousness, until the inimitable determination to secure them seized her, but how? To enter her room by the door would not only arouse the hostess, but maybe the guests as well. There was but one way, by the window, and this undertaking was decidedly hazardous, for it meant that she must crawl along the narrow ledge between her window and that of Mrs. Wharton, a distance of twenty feet, and one slight misstep would result in her being dashed to death on the walk below. But when a woman will, so she makes the trip without mishap, entering the room she searches noiselessly for the top of the dresser, finds it, secures the necklace, and makes her way back to her apartment. Now to hide the jewels. An ingenious idea strikes her. She cuts in two a bar of soap, and hollowing it out, places the treasure inside and joins the parts together. Meanwhile Mrs. Wharton, aroused from her slumber, intuitively looks to her diamonds, but finds them gone. "What's this? A clue!" On the dresser there is a sheet of the palmister's paper on which there is a handprint of dust. Down to the drawing room for the corresponding imprint. There it is, and signed "Myrtle Vane." To Miss Vane's room goes the furious Mrs. Wharton, and during the scene that transpires the soap is brushed from the table and breaks open, exposing the necklace, at the same time convicting the poor girl. Upon the recovery of her jewels, Mrs. Wharton's anger subsides and she is inclined to be charitable towards the unfortunate girl kneeling at her feet, so she not only forgives her, but insists upon aiding her financially.

At a reception given in his honor by Lieut. Penrose, an Indian agent, the civilized brave meets Gladys, the lieutenant's daughter, and falls desperately in love with her. You may be sure he is indignantly repulsed by Gladys and ordered from the house for his presumption by her father. With pique he leaves, and we next find him in his own room, crushed and disappointed, for he realizes the truth: "Good enough as a hero, but not as a husband." What was the use of his struggle? As he reasons, his long suppressed nature asserts itself and he hears the call of the wild: "Out there is your sphere, on the boundless plains, careless and free, among your kind and kin, where all is truth." Here he sits; this nostalgic fever growing more intense every second, until in a fury he tears off the conventional clothes he wears, donning in their stead his suit of leather, with blanket and feathered headgear. Thus garbed, and with a bottle of whiskey, he makes his way back to his former associates in the wilds. He plans vengeance and the opportunity presents itself, when he surprises Gladys out horseback riding. He captures her after a spirited chase and intended holding her captive, but she appeals to him, calling to his mind the presence of the All Powerful Master above, who knows and sees all things, and who is even now calling to him to do right. He listens to the call of this Higher Voice, and helping her to her saddle, sadly watches her ride off homeward.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-31 00:03:36.317000000

Mrs. Martin, the poor widowed mother of a seven-year-old child, returns to her cheerless apartment, after a long day's tramp in search of work, and all in vain. The little one asks her mother if Santa Clans is coming, to which the poor, almost heartbroken woman is unable to answer. The baby then says, "I'll write him a letter to be sure to come." And so she writes on a scrap of paper, "Dear Santa, please don't forget little Margie. Me and mamma ain't got no food even. Little Margie, 114 Broome St., top floor." This she shows her mother who is unable to control her emotion. Baby then hangs up her stocking, putting the letter in it. When the little one is asleep, the mother takes the note, and reading it, is driven almost mad with helplessness. With the child's missive clutched in her hand, she takes up her cloak and hurries to the pawnshop, which is presided over by Mike McLaren, an Irish pawnbroker. Mike's reputation as a philanthropist is not very pronounced. On the contrary as we see him he appears to be a cruel, pitiless Hibernian, without a grain of charity in his makeup. Ah! but who can reckon the power of the Christmas spirit. Mrs. Martin enters Mike's place and proffers her cloak as a pledge for a few cents, but Mike throws the cloak back at her with an invective. It is worth nothing to him, so he will allow her nothing. In her mental agony she absent-mindedly drops the baby's letter on the floor. Mike picks this up alter she leaves. What a change comes over him as he reads the child's innocent appeal. Hustling his clerks about, he bids them buy a Christmas tree, ornaments, toys and provisions. This done, he enlists the service of a couple of burglars, who burglarize Mrs. Martin's apartment, slightly chloroforming her and her child, so as to be sure of their not waking while they are at work. In comes the clerk with the tree and presents, which Mike arranges, and when finished, he goes out into the hall to watch the effect. He hasn't long to wait, and he dances around like a child at the view he gets through the keyhole, hurrying off before the inmates learn from whence their blessing came. The little one attributes it to her letter to Santa, and in truth it was, but they never knew the real Santa. "To dry up a single tear has more of honest fame than shedding seas of gore."

They are classmates, roommates and players on the college football team, and being stalwart, athletic youths, have won hearty encomiums from the spectators for their superb work on the "gridiron." They were the fastest of friends until a young girl appeared and by the workings of cruel fate was beloved by both. Now the golden woof in the weave of friendship becomes badly tangled, as we shall see. The girl has given her heart to one of the classmates, unknown to the other, who meets her for the first time at the football game, by the way, a most spirited scene, showing the team's quarters and then the actual game, which is undoubtedly the finest ever photographed. The graduation exercises follow and are attended by the highest dignitaries of Church and State, prominent among whom will be seen President Roosevelt, Bishop Potter, Seth Low, etc. This is followed in time by the graduation ball, during the course of which there is a confetti dance. This, without exception, is the most beautiful scene ever shown in motion pictures. As the dance progresses the dancers are showered with a veritable blizzard of tiny stars and ribbons, producing an effect simply indescribable. It is during these festivities that the youth confesses his love for the girl, and is plunged into the depths of despair when told that her heart is another's, his chum. How coldly do the classmates part, when the next day they start on their divergent paths of life. The unsuccessful suitor to the West, where he engages in mining pursuits, and the other to the metropolis of the East, becoming a successful financier, the owner of fast horses and, above all, the liege lord of the fair charmer. Two years later the Westerner is drawn on business East, and meets his old classmate. The dead coals of their friendship are mildly rekindled and an invitation accepted to visit the Easterner's home. While the trio are enjoying a pleasant chat over old times, an urgent message calls the husband to his stable on account of the illness of his most valuable racer, leaving his wife to entertain his chum until his return. The chum takes advantage of his absence to renew his protestations of love, which are spurned by the wife, who, when he becomes persistent, attempts to avoid him, mounting the stairs leading to the upper floor. He follows, whereupon the wife, with a well-directed blow, sends him reeling down the stairs, crashing through the balustrade to the floor below, just as the husband reenters, amazed at the sight. The woman's denunciation of the false friend brings about a terrific combat. About the room they struggle, smashing furniture and bric-a-brac to atoms, until the husband lands a powerful blow upon his adversary, dropping him like a log. He picks up a chair and would brain him but for his wife, who leaps between them, forming a picture and finish to a film story seldom, if ever, equaled.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:05:32.167000000

She notices its absence ...	Mr. and Mrs. Brown are preparing to attend a banquet, and Mrs. Brown takes from the jewel case a beautiful pearl necklace, but in her haste forgets to put it on. She notices its absence while seated at the banquet board and is very much wrought up in consequence, but Mr. Brown assures her that she will find it safe upon their return home. As one of the guests, there is a party named Wells, who, unknown to all, is a gentleman burglar. Hearing of the forgotten necklace, he sees the chance of a rich haul, and feigning illness, leaves the banquet hall, makes his way to the Brown apartments and is just about to decamp with the loot, when the Browns return; so he hides behind the portieres that cover the window, leaving the necklace lying on the dresser. Brown is a bit boozy, and goes out again, ostensibly to procure cigars. While he is gone, Mrs. Brown retires. Wells seizes this opportunity to get out, but hearing the approach of Brown, compels Mrs. Brown to hide him, or he will pretend to her husband that he is her lover. Here is a dilemma. Well, she conceals him in the closet. Brown enters, and taking off his coat goes to the closet to hang it up, and it looks for the moment that a discovery is inevitable, so Wells sneaks from there, and after ineffectually seeking a place of safety for some minutes, is finally caught. He throws suspicion on poor Mrs. Brown, who in vain tries to convince her husband the fellow is a thief. Finally the husband hands her a pistol and commands her to shoot her lover, or thief, whichever he be. This the wife is loath to do, but as Wells raises a gun and is about to shoot her husband, she sends a bullet through his wrist, dropping the gun from his hand. At this moment a couple of policemen, who had heard the skirmish, rush in and secure Wells, in whose pockets are found many articles of value, proving conclusively his true character. Brown now shamefacedly implores the forgiveness of his wife for his suspicious.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:25.037000000

But, alas! he is human, and in his employ is a very beautiful girl as model. This girl has loved her employer with a suppressed, hopeless passion, which needed but a breath to fan it into a blaze. In justice to her it must be said that she didn't realize the strength of this feeling, smothering it with admiration for the artist's devotion for his wife. Ah, but the Devil knows how to play the game, and his promptings are so fascinatingly impressive that few can resist. But who is the Devil? He is the embodiment of our evil inclination warring with the pure. So it was that at his prompting the artist falls, as does his model. They are discovered by the wife, who in turn is prompted by the Devil to "get even," which she heeds. She is surprised by her husband in a private dining-room of a café in company with a gentleman friend. In frenzy he leaps at his wife's throat, and the Devil laughs. He would have sent her to him then and there, hut for the intervention of the waiters. In terror, the poor woman rushes to her home. She is followed by the crazed husband. In vain she pleads, but the Devil prompts: "Kill." Taking a revolver from the dresser-drawer, he moves deliberately toward the terrified wife, and the Devil laughs. A shot and a body and soul part; another shot, and "There was the Devil to pay," and he collected. This subject, while thrilling, is most ingeniously handled, with photographic quality of the highest order, showing a stereoscopic effect never before attained.

The opening scenes show the departure from their homes, mothers, wives and sweethearts of a number of patriotic young men to the front. Life on the field of battle and their capture as prisoners of war is next shown. While incarcerated in the foul military prison, the poor creatures are subjected to many indignities that even a dog would resent and during the six months of their confinement they industriously bore through the earth under the dungeon, with no other tools than their fingers, until they tunnel their way to liberty. The escape is of course discovered and, though chased, they succeed in reaching home, where their raggedly clothed emaciated forms are once more folded in the arms of their loved ones.

Pong Lee, a Mephistophelian, saffron-skinned varlet, has for some time carried on this atrocious female white slave traffic, in which sinister business he was assisted by a stygian whelp, by name Hendricks. Pong writes Hendricks that he has need for five young girls, and so Hendricks sets out to secure them. Visiting a rural district, he has no trouble, by his glib, affable manner, in gaining the confidence of several young and pretty girls. Pong is on hand with a closed carriage to bag the prey. One of the girls, as she is seized, emits a yell that alarms the neighborhood and brings to the scene several policemen and a couple of detectives, who have long been on the lookout for these caitiffs. The Chinese get away with the carriage, however, and Hendricks by subterfuge throws the police on the wrong scent. One of the detectives is a woman, and possessed of shrewd powers of deduction, hence does not swallow the bald story of the villain, and exercises her natural acumen with success. She shadows Hendricks, and by means of a flirtation inveigles him to a restaurant, where she succeeds in doping his drink. He falls asleep and she secures the letter written by Pong, which discloses the hiding place of the Chinaman. This she immediately telephones to the police, and while so doing Hendricks awakes and starts off to warn his friends. He arrives at the old deserted house ahead of the police, but escape is impossible, so the police rescue the girls, but fail to secure Pong and Hendricks, who afterwards seize the girl detective, and taking her to the house, tie her to a post and arrange a large pistol on the face of a clock in such a way that when the hands point to twelve the gun is fired and the girl will receive the charge. Twenty minutes are allowed for them to get away, for the hands are now indicating 11:40. Certain death seems to be her fate, and would have been had not an accident disclosed her plight. Hendricks after leaving the place is thrown by a street car, and this serves to discover his identity, so he is captured and a wild ride is made to the house in which the poor girl is incarcerated. This incident is shown in alternate scenes. There is the helpless girl, with the clock ticking its way towards her destruction, and out on the road is the carriage, tearing along at breakneck speed to the rescue, arriving just in time to get her safely out of range of the pistol as it goes off. In conclusion we can promise this to be an exceedingly thrilling film, of more than ordinary interest.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-20 00:30:01.703000000

This never impressed old Wilkins so forcibly as when his son and daughter give him the go-by, stamping him as a "has-been," and away out of the game. Even Mrs. Wilkins, who is as vivacious as a widow, snubs him. He keenly feels his condition and resolves to alter it. With this in view, he enlists the services of Professor Dyem, the celebrated Dermatologist and Tonsorial Artist. After a session with the Professor, beheld the transmogrified Wilkins. What a change! Shorn of his grizzly beard, his locks raven, complexion florid, eye clear and step elastic, he views himself in the mirror. He hardly recognizes himself. In fact, it requires his valet to convince him that he is he. "Am I in it? Well. I guess. If I don't keep up with and even beat that bandwagon by a city block, my name is not Pill Wilkins." He sallies forth and makes for the park. The first person he encounters is his wife. He approaches her in elation, but she mistakes him for an impudent masher and he receives the weight of her parasol over his head for his trouble. The next one he meets is his daughter. She is seated on a bench, waiting for Charley. He takes a seat beside her and when he tries to make himself known she draws herself up to full height and with a blow sends him backward over the bench onto the grass. Well, he changes his tactics, and gets reckless. Along comes his son with his best girl, so he decides to win her out for spite. Now this young lady has a sensitive pneumogastric nerve, and when he sits beside her on the bench and slyly suggests a cold bottle and a hot bird, she is "his'n." This is done so coolly and so quickly, that young Wilkins, who, of course, does not recognize his respected papa, is speechless with rage. He follows them, however, to the café, where his intrusion is resented and he is rudely thrown from the place. At the Wilkins' domicile there is an indignation meeting. Mother, daughter and son all rush in to relate their experiences to father. He is not to be found. Suddenly a hilarious individual enters. "'Tis he, the insulter: a drunk and disorderly." They are about to have him thrown out when the valet comes to his rescue and explains that the jubilant gentleman is no other than their dear papa, who has not only caught up with the bandwagon, but is sitting on the seat with the driver. They all gasp in surprise, and young Wilkins takes a wreath of laurel from a statue and places it on old Wilkins' brow, saying: "Pop, you are the candy."	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:26.740000000

The Wilkinsons and Caulfields, owing to a trivial dispute, had been at loggerheads for years and as time went on the feeling became more bitter, until they even forbade their children playing together. The little ones, however, in their childish innocence, could not appreciate the odium of their elders, and Bobby Wilkinson and Nellie Caulfield became child lovers. This incensed Colonel Wilkinson, who tore the children apart, ordered Bobby never to be seen in her company again. The Colonel's action ignited the ire of the Caulfields and a furious conflict ensued, resulting in the shooting to death of George, the Colonel's youngest son, a boy of fourteen. From that time on the clans kept strictly to themselves. But love knows no clannishness, and, despite family hatred, Bob and Nellie remained lovers. After ten years, driven to desperation by this apparently insurmountable barrier, they elope and are married. Bob decides to brave the storm of his father's anger and present his wife, but the old Colonel drives him from the house, disowning him. Old Aunt Dinah and Uncle Daniel, the colored servants, were so attached to the young folks that they go with them. Two years later we find the little family, now increased by an infant son, having a hard of it. It is Christmas morning and no turkey for dinner. Old Aunt Dinah, believing in the efficacy of prayer, gets down on her knees in the kitchen to ask the good Lord to send them a bird. Uncle Daniel, touched by this demonstration of faith, takes a gun and determines to get a turkey at any hazard. Over the hills he goes, but his journey is hopelessly fruitless until he comes to the rear of the Colonel's house. Tillie, the cook, has just hung a fat turkey on a post outside the kitchen door. When Daniel sees it he can't resist the temptation. Back home he hustles and finds Dinah still at prayer, he lays the fowl on the floor beside her and sneaks out. When Dinah sees it she surely thinks it was due to her prayers. Well, the turkey is cooked and an old-fashioned Christmas anticipated. Meanwhile the Colonel has discovered his loss and tracks the thief to Bob's estate. Entering, a tragedy seems inevitable, but when the old Colonel sees the young one, his grandson, in the cradle, his heart goes out to it and the feud ends then and there. All hands sit down and enjoy a real Merry Christmas dinner.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:21.350000000

They take frequent pulls from a brandy bottle on the table between them. The door opens and Mimi, a very pretty girl, thin and pale, enters, carrying a basket of flowers on her arm. She comes timidly forward. Bambard rises to his feet, staggers toward her in a half-drunken manner, points to her full basket of flowers, roughly pushes her and orders her out again. She sinks exhausted on a chair and pleads for a rest, but Bambard strikes her and forces her out the door. The two thieves resume their conversation, and after a while gather some burglar tools, leaving mother Martin, another member of the gang, in charge and depart. The flower girl wanders along to a fashionable part of the city, meeting with but little success in disposing of her flowers. An automobile dashes up, and Rene Masson, a handsome young man, alights. Mimi offers him a bunch of flowers. He looks at her face, takes them and gives in return several bank notes. At this moment the girl is seized with a sudden faintness, staggers and would have fallen had not the young man caught her. He places her in his auto and starts for home. Bambard and Pigord, who have been watching from across the street, start off in the same direction. The young man reaches his apartments, carries in the unconscious girl and places her on a couch. Forcing some wine between her lips, the girl soon revives and opens her eyes in wonderment. She is given food and drink, recovers from her faintness and asks to go. Her protector accompanies her and they have scarcely left the room when Bambard and Pigord enter, ransack the place, carrying away bank notes, jewels, plate, etc. They proceed to their den, tell of their escapade, also of the fainting of Mimi. A plan is conceived to lure the young man to the den and a note dispatched offering to return the plunder for a cash ransom, and signed the flower girl. Rene receives the decoy letter, takes a roll of bank notes, his revolver and departs. Mimi returns to the rendezvous, learns of the robbery and also of the plan to trap the young millionaire and determines to save him. She eludes mother Martin, jumps from the window and hurries to the police inspector, and, with several officers, starts for the gang's headquarters. Meanwhile the young millionaire proceeds to the address given, and as he crosses the threshold, the thieves spring upon him, overpower and bind him. Bambard, after securing the young man's money, points his revolver at Rene's head. As he fires, the door flies open and Mimi jumps in front of Rene and receives the bullet instead of him. The officers follow and after a short struggle the gang is overpowered and taken away. Rene's bonds are removed. He rushes over to the flower girl, raises her in his arms, she looks up with a smile, presses his hand and falls back dead. Rene gazes for a moment, bends down and kisses her forehead reverently.

Two denizens of the underworld are seen in their squalid furnished room planning a robbery. Their intended victim is known to hold at all times in his safe at home a large sum of money and a wealth of jewels. Gathering together the tools of their nefarious calling, they start off, arriving at the house shortly after the master had retired for the night. Entrance is easily and noiselessly effected. A chloroform-soaked handkerchief soon puts the master beyond the power of interfering and the safe is broken open. The sight that greets them almost makes them gasp. There in this strong box is not only an enormous sum of money, but many valuable jewels as well, prominent among which is a handsome diamond necklace. All this is put into a cloth, and a hurried egress made. Back to their room they go to divide the spoils of their night's haul. The diamond necklace being an indivisible article, a contention is at once raised between the partners in crime. There is no way in which they seem able one to satisfy the other, so they drop the argument for the time being to eat lunch. One, to make sure that he shall be the possessor of the loot, drops poison in the coffee of his chum, Which he drinks, and is soon in the throes of convulsions, falling to the floor lifeless, while the other stands by sardonically gloating over his seeming victory; but his elation is short-lived, for he is now seized with the same agony and pitches forward alongside his partner. The two had played the same game, each unknown to the other. "Honor among thieves?"-Bah!	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:29.897000000

As he is about to leave, Henderson, the manager, calls to pay a sum due him for royalties. At the same time, Frank Wilson, a friend of the family, drops in. Henderson hands over to Robertson several thousand dollars and departs. He places the money temporarily in his desk and prepares for his journey, excusing himself to Wilson, at the same time begging him to make himself at home, he departs. Now with the family there was employed a French maid, whose carelessness just before this scene, incurred the displeasure of Mrs. Robertson, who discharged her. Wilson is a bank cashier and has fallen into the error of so many of his kind. As his peculations are detected, and well-grounded rumors already rife, he comes to ask the wise counsel of his friends. Robertson having departed, Wilson hesitatingly unburdens his mind to Mrs. Robertson, who, of course, is amazed at his recital. While they are engaged in whispered conversation, the maid, who has packed her belongings to leave, peeks in. An idea strikes her: a chance too good to lose, so she noiselessly reverses the key in the door and locks it from the outside, thus leaving the couple prisoners. Out of the house she rushes to overtake Robertson, which she does at the next corner. Loud and impressive are her defamations, which not only arouse the jealousy of the husband, but curiosity of the passersby as well. Back to the house dashes Robertson and upon finding the door locked, the maid's story seems only too true. Inside the room consternation had at first seized the couple, and then the wife accuses Wilson of duplicity: "No, no! Not that! I'm not as low as that, but we must think, and think quickly. Ah! Go into that room." The wife does as he commands and Wilson makes for the desk, bursts it open and is taking the money as Robertson, in a frenzy, crashes into the room. He slops short at the scene that greets his sight. There is his wife, whom he had for the moment doubted, coming from her room, and his most cherished friend standing over the wrecked desk with the implicating bank notes still in his hand. For an instant all seemed paralyzed: then from the husband: "Go." Wilson, with bowed head, leaves. He has chosen to hurl himself into the slough of degradation to save the honor of his friend's wife.

Bill Preston, a heartless roadabout, too despicable for the association of white men, had gathered about him a little band of low-down redskins, whom he seemed to rule by extreme despotism. At any rate, they all feared him, as he, with them, terrorized the whole country 'round, by acts of pillage, arson and worse. Bill, despite his black nature, was a handsome fellow, who, under different conditions, might be called attractive. This the case, there is reason why Nellie Carson, a girl of the frontier, should fall so violently in love with him, casting her lot with his. She soon finds out his true nature, but even then she seems to be held by an irresistible power, though, he would cast her off, which he tries to do, leaving her lying wounded and insensible in the road, after a stormy scene between them. She is discovered by a girl of the mountains, who offers to help her to her mountain home. Though moved by the girl's kindness, she rejects her offer, choosing to go her own way on the road of life she has picked out. The mountain girl drives off and is waylaid by Bill, who seizes her and brings her to his camp. Nellie, coming along later, discovers evidence of what has taken place, and with a feeling of pity for the girl, and jealousy of Bill, resolves to save her. She arrives at camp at nightfall and manages to release the girl and get away, but unfortunately her revolver drops to the ground, and exploding, awakens the gang. The girl's plight looks bad for the instant, and would have been disastrous had not one of the Indians, who had always shown a weakness for Nellie, handicapped Bill. This enabled the girls, who mounted the one horse, to get a lead. However, Bill and his red devils are fast gaining on them, and several of his bullets have taken effect in poor Nellie's body, who has sacrificially placed herself between the mountain girl and Bill. The girl's apprehension seems inevitable, when the Indian rides up, and Bill, with a dagger wound in the breast, falls from his horse, thereby closing his contemptible career. This in a measure demoralizes the gang, and the girls reach the mountaineer's cabin, but Nellie is mortally wounded and expires as she is taken from the horse, the good Indian driving up just in time to claim her body that he might bury it. This subject is an exceptionally thrilling one, with photography of the highest order, and many of the scenes tinted.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:28.613000000

However, pretty little O Yama Sum had a will of her own, and casting tradition to the winds, insisted upon making her own choice. The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior. She writes to him to meet her by the Great Lamp of Savatiya that night, and they are nearly caught through the treachery of one of the butterflies of the court, who tells the Daimio of his rival. The lover escapes by hiding in the great lamp and afterwards being conveyed in a large hamper to the Bower of Roses, where he is eventually captured and thrown into the torture chamber. The Daimio, to render his revenge more complete, conveys to O Yama a false message from her lover, with his, the Daimio's, permission to see him. She is conducted to the chamber, and the sight that greets her fairly paralyzes her; for here is her lover hung by the wrists, dangling over a treacherous bed of upturned knife-blades, which inflict ugly wounds at the slightest move of his body. Besides this, there is a sword lying across a fire to be used at order from the Daimio. Here the Daimio gives poor O Yama her choice between her marriage with him or her lover's torture. But the brave warrior urges her to refuse. The sword, now incandescently hot, is applied to his breast, leaving great red scars, but he is still obdurate, until at length he is cut down and expires in the arms of O Yama. As he fails, his dagger drops to the floor, and O Yama, unobserved, conceals it in her obi. Then, turning to the Daimio, she consents to become his bride. He, delighted by her apparent change of heart, orders the preparations for the wedding to be made at once, which, according to Japanese custom, is to take place just before sundown. There in the wedding hall are assembled the courtiers and butterflies, when enter the priest, or "Marrier," as he is called, followed by O Yama, her mother and the Daimio. The Daimio, his bride-elect, and her mother take their places on the cushions, while the Marrier pours the sake, handing the cup first to the mother, then to the Daimio, who both drink of the wine, and finally to O Yama, who, instead of drinking, whips the dagger from her obi, plunges it deep into the heart of the Daimio, who drops like a log, dead at her feet, and before anyone can intervene she performs the happy dispatch with the same bodkin, so concluding a film story that is not only a most exciting and novel one, but extremely picturesque as well.

Poor Jones plodded along in his wearying struggle to earn the pittance with which to maintain the home, and though often plunged into doleful, dismal doldrums, being of an imperturbable nature, patiently toiled on. Hence it was that he hailed with keen delight the opportunity of taking a day off. No other arrangement was made than to spend the day as one of absolute rest at home. How well he succeeded is most lucidly shown in this Biograph film. It is during May, and we know what transpires in all well-regulated households during this month, and with cruel coincidence, his holiday and general house-cleaning were set for the same day. Jones starts in all right. He takes a fine cigar, the morning paper, selects the easiest chair in the parlor, and assumes for the nonce the air of a gentleman of leisure. But, alas, his beatific dream was rudely disturbed by Wifey: "John, dear, I really cannot get this stovepipe back in place; it doesn't seem to fit." Well, we know what a prolix undertaking this is. John struggled and swore, fretted and fussed, until down came the whole affair, covering him with a suit of soot from head to feet. A bath is next in order. Having divested himself of this ebony complexion, he is back in the parlor, but hardly seated, when Mrs. Jones calls him to the kitchen to fix the water pipe. He succeeds only in getting a thorough drenching, and once more a change of apparel is necessary. This being done, his wife now demands he hang a picture. "Ah, let us alone." But Wifey insists. A stepladder is brought in and Jones ascends it, armed with hammer and nails, with a large picture frame under his arm. The nail is held in position, and, "Why, John!" says Wifey, "such language, and before baby." John had aimed the hammer at the nail head, but hit his thumb. Another blow, more vigorous than the first, is sent, "Gee, whiz, twice in the same place. Biddy Mulligan." Jones, with a yell of pain, leaps in the air and there is a mad race between his head and the picture frame for the floor; it was a dead heat. Wifey is awfully sorry, and allows him to pacify and amuse himself with minding the baby, a delicate attention on her part. Still, it might be worse, and soon it is, for Wifey's voice is heard calling, "John, dear, the gas is leaking." Jones, with a lighted candle, goes into the cellar in search of the leak, and finds it; and when the smoke and dust of the explosion clears away, poor John is seen stretched out on the cellar floor. Oh, but what's the use? John was given a day of rest by the boss, and he rests with a vengeance.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:06:55.713000000

According to the rapid strides that electricity is making in this wonderful age we are not surprised to see in this picture an ideal hotel of the future in which everything is done by electricity. We see a couple entering the hostelry and, after registering, the clerk touches a button and away goes the baggage on to the elevator, which stops at the proper floors and the grips enter the room without the aid of anyone. Many amusing incidents follow. Finally they pay the penalty for all the latest improvements, for something goes wrong with the electric plant in the cellar and mixes the whole place up. We see all the furnishings start to turn in all directions and the unfortunate guests find themselves in the midst of the affray. They manage to get to the door and are tumbled out and rolled across the street till out of the reach of the magnetic force, where they pick up their belongings and hurry home, vowing never to enter another electric hotel.

Her artless rustic simplicity, rivaling Hebe's gorgeous radiance, phlogisticates the susceptible hearts of the village swains. But alas, Hulda was a fickle maid, and seemed to have as many phases as the moon, with a smile for all and a frown for none. Her capriciousness was the cause of much unrest, both for herself and her lovers, for when her parents had departed for a visit, leaving her in charge of the kitchen, she received most effusively Jocular Jake, the village cut-up, only to hide him above stairs at the entrance of Previous-Hearted Pat, the hostler, who in turn is hidden in the Dutch oven at the approach of Handy Hank, the chore boy. Now Hank has long loved the fair Hulda, but, gol darn it, somehow or other he just can't tell her, and so he puts it off. The next to arrive is Asinine Alfred, the city chap. He makes quite a hit, but again an interruption sends him unwillingly to the wood box. "Drat it all!" It is only Hank with an armful of wood, which he throws in on the unfortunate Alfred. The worst is not yet, for in walks Generous George, the grocer's clerk, who is the beau ideal of the village; so he thinks. Again that tantalizing interruption. "The pickle barrel for yours, dear George, I hear someone coming." and in he gets. The cause of the alarm is Solemn Si, the favored. Now, here is a condition most perplexing; Jake upstairs, Pat in the oven, Alfred in the wood box, George in the pickle barrel, Si in her arms and the hour of her parents' return fast approaching. Still she faces it with wonderful composure, enjoying the company of her sincere, simple suitor, Si, when mama enters. Consternation! Down through the ceiling comes Jake, out of the oven rolls Pat, up from the depths of the wood box and pickle barrel rise Alfred and George, while Si seeks shelter under the kitchen table. Girls, you are warned against having two strings to your bow, but Hulda's was like a harp.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:07:00.760000000

Had the poor melancholy Dane, Hamlet, lived in this, the twentieth century, he would never have given voice to the remark, "Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!" No indeed! He would have procured some of the mysterious fluid compounded by an erudite scientist by which things animate and inanimate were rendered non est, for ten minutes at least, by simply spraying them with it. In an atomizer, he sends a quantity, accompanied by a letter, to his brother. In the hope of his putting it on the market. The brother regards it as a joke, and, while toying with the atomizer, accidentally sprays himself. Presto! he is gone, to the amazement of the messenger boy who has carried the package thither. The boy reads the letter, and at once sees the amount of fun he can get out of it, so he nips it. Strolling along the avenue is a young girl, leading a dog by a chain. Swish! and a dangling chain is all that is left with the girl. Next, a Dago with a fruit stand: first, the fruit stand is made to disappear, then the Dago himself. Two expressmen are lifting a heavy trunk from their wagon when the boy appears. Same result, trunk vamooses, as do the expressmen, with another squirt of the fluid. A wedding party is just leaving church when this young imp comes along. The groom vanishes, and the bride is thrown into hysterics. Into the park be meanders, and many and ludicrous are the tricks he plays. Finally, he enters a restaurant, and, after almost throwing the place into a panic, goes to pay his cheek, but, instead, he, with one spray, obliterates the young lady cashier and then steals the cash register. He is now chased by a mob of his victims, who have by this time overcome the influence of the fluid and become reincarnate. Halting on the road, he turns on his pursuers and effects their disappearance one after another as they approach him. A copper steals up from behind, and, taken unawares, he is carried off to the station house. With a policeman on each aide of him, he appears before the judge. Picking up the atomizer, he gives it a squeeze and vanishes instantly, leaving the judge and officers dumbfounded.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-20 00:18:41.850000000

Not always, but sometimes. Hence it was that the dulcet tones produced by Heinie Holtzmeyer, the fiddler, and Orpheus of the little Holland Village, failed to tranquilize his wife Lena, who was rather a Xantippe than an Eurydice, and Heinie's head, like that of Socrates, often played the target for her pots and pans, and her aim was very good. The poor fellow sought solace at the public house, where he met the toss-pots of the town, and right merry souls were they. His fiddle made him a favorite with all, especially the barmaids, who rewarded his efforts with wine and kisses. His joys, however, are of short duration, for Lena appears, and, brandishing a rolling-pin, clears out the place. Heinie rushes home, packs his bag and, with his fiddle, decamps. He is followed by Lena until he reaches the wharf, where he finds himself, as it were, "between the devil and the deep sea," so he chooses the sea. Jumping into a row-boat he rows to an outgoing vessel, ships and is off for parts unknown. A storm is encountered, and the vessel is wrecked, but fortune favors and he is cast ashore. Heinie is about to give thanks for his deliverance when he is pounced upon by an army of ferocious cannibals, armed with clubs and excaliburs, now wouldn't that discombobulate you? Well, it looked like Stew à la Hollandaise for Heinie. And indeed, the black warriors are about to prepare a Dutch dinner, when the Queen does the Pocahontas act and, throwing herself on the prostrate form of Heinie, declares that they shall strike him only through her. So they desist, for such a thing would be impossible, as the Queen is so thick through, that the longest spear would hardly reach the victim. In fact, she is that obese she looks like a crowd. Heinie now takes his fiddle and discourses sweet music, which places him in such high esteem with the tribe that be experiences his own apotheosis, besides becoming the husband of the Queen and King of the islands. Lena, after three years of relentless endeavor, discovers his whereabouts, and bursts in unannounced upon his sunny serenity. Aha! Here is his chance to set even, and as she had kept him in hot water at Holland, he does as much for her now: hence, he consigns her to the stewpot. Moral: the worm will turn.

A bitter war is waging between two kingdoms, and as the King and Queen hold court in the throne room of the palace there arrives a courier, who, battered and exhausted, has scarcely strength as he falls at the foot of the throne to thrust into the hands of the anxious King, a message which tells of the disaster and panic that has befallen his forces. The King immediately holds council of war and calls for a trusty messenger to carry to his armies the reassuring intelligence that reinforcements have been rushed to their aid. The lot falls to a brave young courier, lion-hearted and with nerve of steel, who, before setting off, goes to take leave of his sweetheart. He discovers her resenting the unwelcomed advances of his rival, a contemptible scoundrel. The villain departs, swearing vengeance, and shadows the hero as he rides off. The sweetheart, on horseback follows to warn her lover of his danger. Now the villain, with the aid of his mistress, who has arranged a meeting by letter, dupes the hero by lying in the road, pretending she is wounded. The hero dismounts to assist her, and is stabbed in the back by the villain, who had hidden in the bush. He secures the message and they make for a neighboring inn, leaving the hero lying in the road, where he is found later by his sweetheart and her attendants. The lover is cared for by his sweetheart and some kindly farm folk, and the attendants are hastened to bring guards. The letter to the villain is found in the road, which indicates his whereabouts, and they repair to the inn where the villain is surprised and arrested. Recovering the message, the hero hastens on to the army. With renewed vigor the opposing forces are repelled and the day won. The last scene shows the return of the gallant courier with this cheering news. He is knighted by the King, and formally betrothed to his faithful sweetheart.

At the parish church the worshipers are observed leaving, among them Magistrate Lorenz. Father Herman and Madalene, a charming young girl whom Lorenz has chosen as the wife of his son Rudolph. They proceed to the home of Lorenz, where Rudolph is observed seated on a bench, meditating. The young man is upbraided by the father for his failure to attend religious services, and while in conversation Leah appears, closely followed by the angry mob. The crowd makes a rush toward her, the priest raises the cross before them and they cower in fear. Beneath a large cross in the forest, Leah is waiting expectantly. Rudolph appears and the lovers, for such they are, rush into each other's arms. The young man asks Leah to marry him and leave home. She promises, and after vowing eternal fidelity the lovers part, agreeing to meet the following day at the same place and from there leave for other parts. Nathan, an apostate Jew, has stolen in behind the pair during their conversation, hears all and gleefully departs unnoticed. He proceeds directly to the home of the magistrate and tells of Rudolph's love for the Jewess. Lorenz is furious, will not believe the tale, and bids Nathan begone. At this time Rudolph appears, and being asked for the truth, haughtily admits his love for Leah. The old magistrate is heartbroken, and he and Nathan decide to buy off Leah with gold. Although indignant, Rudolph consents to have her love tested. Nathan leaves with the large purse of gold and shortly comes upon her. He offers her the purse which she angrily throws to the ground and indignantly leaves him. Nathan stands for the moment perplexed, then puts the gold in his own pocket, takes the empty purse, returns in the house, and shows the purse minus the gold. The father and his associates are overjoyed, while Rudolph is heartbroken. The next day at the appointed time Leah goes to the forest and waits anxiously for Rudolph. As time passes on and he does not appear, she falls to the ground in bitter grief at his supposed unfaithfulness. At his home Rudolph is heartbroken over what he thinks her falsity. He goes inside warily with his father, and presently Leah approaches the house, knocks at the door and begs to speak to Rudolph. The father orders her away. Rudolph appears in the doorway, starts upon seeing Leah, and angrily bids her depart. Leah does not understand his changed manner and pleads with him. Rudolph denounces her, then passes inside, leaving the Jewess in agony on the steps. Preparations for the marriage of Madalene to Rudolph are quickly made and they repair to the church for the ceremony. Leah creeps up to the door and hides as the party enters. She watches the ceremony, and as the villagers leave the church, falls in a faint. Again at the cross in the forest Rudolph is as Leah appears before him. She upbraids him for his faithlessness, while he shows the empty purse and accuses her. She at last comprehends the situation and indignantly denies having taken the money. Rudolph also sees the mistake, falls to his knees and asks for pardon. Leah haughtily turns away, tells of her suffering, and, bitterly abusing him, departs. Five years elapse, and outside Rudolph's home he and Madalene and their little child are seated. Leah comes upon the little girl and kisses the child lovingly. The villagers come upon the pair and jeer at the Jewess. The noise brings Rudolph and Madalene from the house, and Leah points to Nathan, the leader of the mob, denounces him as an apostate Jew, a thief and the instigator of her unhappiness. Rudolph shows the empty purse, justifying the charge. Nathan is taken in hand by officers and dragged away. Leah staggers, then falls dead at Rudolph's feet.	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-10-08 00:38:19.847000000

So the trains,...	Lonesome Junction, though a howling wilderness, possessed one blessing, a train to somewhere else, but like all good things in this world, none are gained without a struggle. So the trains, of which there was but one a day, are never on time. To the station there comes a coterie of weary travelers, all possessed with a wild desire to put a long distance between Lonesome Junction and the backs of their necks. As usual, the train is six hours late, and you may imagine the party is in not a very amiable humor. The first to arrive is an Englishman, who is "jolly well" vexed at the condition of affairs. "Train six hours late! Hit's a blooming h'outrage, don't you know!" He leaves his suit case in the sway of others coming in, and a wealthy mine owner, who enters at that moment, falls sprawling. The next to enter is a prize-fighter, who in turn takes a tumble. Wow! It looks as if there is going to be "something doing," when the driver of the Pony Express enters with the mail bag, and tells Mr. Pug to sit down and behave. He sits and lights his pipe, still chewing the rag. The driver clips the pipe out of his mouth with a pistol shot and makes him dance to the music of his gun play. This holds Mr. Pug for an indefinite period. The party is now increased by the arrival of Heinrich Spitzelperger. "Vas ist das; sex stunden zu warten ? Oh, vell, I haf a smoke." Heine has pipe and tobacco, but no match. "Please, you haf a match, no?" Well, it looks as if he don't smoke. At this point the door opens and in rushes one of those hypochondriacal phisanthropists, a Black Hand Dago. A hyena is a playful kitten compared with him. Opening his satchel, he takes out a large bomb, lights the fuse and places it on the window shelf of the ticket office. The pugilist is the first to notice his action and yells, "Beat it!" which they surely do, all except Heine, who is seated on a bench still searching through his pockets in hopes of finding a match hidden therein. Espying the smoking fuse of the bomb, he picks it up, ignorant of the danger, lights his pipe and failing to extinguish it, drops it into a fire pail none too soon, for the moment it strikes the water it explodes, blowing Heine off his feet. When the party returns they find him suffering no further injury than badly shattered nerves. While relating his experience there enters a most beautiful young lady. "Observe who is in our midst," says one, and a more chivalrous bunch you never saw; all anxious to serve her. She states that her baggage is outside, so Mr. Pug insists that "I'm de boy wit de strong arm." He carries in several grips and finally a trunk as big as a cottage, which completely does him up, and though there is still another trunk, he is not equal to it. Now Heine gives an exhibition of brain vs. brawn, and instead of shouldering the trunk, wheels it in on a hand truck, much to the amusement of the party at the expense of the pugilist. They are all now in high spirits when there appears in the doorway a tough road agent With most forbidding mien he points a revolver and commands them to line up and put their valuables on the floor in front of him. Heine, unobserved by the bad man, drops down behind the trunk and when the thug's back is turned, sticks a gun behind his ear and tells him to drop his firearm on the top of the trunk. Hurrah for Heine, the hero! But he forgets the thug may have another gun, and in the unguarded moment he whips out another and is about to push daylight through Dutchy when the express driver from outside sends a bullet through the bad boy's wrist. The arrival of the belated train is announced, and the party scramble out of the station, in a mad rush to get aboard.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:07:43.870000000

Of the thousands who daily witness moving picture exhibitions, the number who have any conception of the manner of making a picture is comparatively small. Therefore, to the majority this picture will prove a genuine novelty. It opens in the private office of the Vitagraph Company, where the manuscript is being carefully considered. The studio directors enter, receive their instructions, proceed to the studio, get out the cameras, give orders about scenery, props, etc. Then we get a view of the Vitagraph actors and actresses making up for their different characters. All preparations finished, the Vitagraph automobiles line up. The performers get in and proceed to the scene of operation, which happens to be, in this instance, a busy city thoroughfare. A trolley is held up, numerous little by-plays, not in the lines, occur to add variety and interest to the picture. This scene over, all hands return to the studio, where we see a stupid actor being put through his work. Next a view is given of the quick lunch counter in the Vitagraph plant. Following this, the studio scenes are rehearsed and photographed, showing all the necessary paraphernalia for the different effects required, as well as the rapidity with which scenes are struck and made ready by the stage hands. The picture finally finished is taken to the testing room, where we see it projected. The Story: "Love Is Better than Riches." A young soldier and his sweetheart are sitting in the parlor of the girl's home. The young man proposes and is accepted. The young lady's father enters, is furious when he hears of the engagement, and orders the young man out of the house. He goes, taking his sweetheart with him. They hurry to a church, are married and return to her home. The couple tells the father of their marriage. The old man is beside himself with rage and turns them out into the street. Their start in life is humble, but their home is happy, while that of the father is lonely. The next scene shows the girl and her soldier husband walking along the street. The young man leaves his wife for a moment, when an automobile dashes along, knocking her down. The auto is owned by her father. The old man gets out, recognizes his daughter and wants to take charge of her when the husband appears, waves him aside and takes his wife to their home. We find the young man waiting upon the invalid when the father enters and begs forgiveness. A happy reconciliation takes place and the picture closes with the father fondly embracing his daughter.

John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. God's mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys. Tom and Gladys grew up together, and were child sweethearts, which grew stronger with Gladys as time went on. So deeply did she love the handsome Tom that she put her entire trust in him, feeling sure that he would reciprocate her sacrificial devotion with the honorable obligation it merited. But, oh, how mistaken she was, and only after prayers and tearful entreaties does he agree to marry her, and then only upon condition that she elope. To this she consents most reluctantly, for which act she is disowned by her parents. The villainy that is wrapped up in the black heart of Tom. Truly a marriage ceremony is performed, but it is by a rowdy friend of Tom's, disguised as a clergyman, in fact, a mock marriage. For a time Gladys lived in ignorance of the truth, but it at last came out when Tom deserts her. Back to her home she trudged carrying her infant, and at the door she is met by her mother with open arms but when the father appears, he, still obdurate, drives her away. She then goes to John Wilkins, and tells her sad story. He calls Tom and demands he make immediate reparation. Tom treats the matter lightly and the brothers are on the verge of blows when the blind mother, like a ministering angel, appears, and Tom's heart is at last softened. He takes Gladys and their child to his bosom, while they receive the benediction bestowed by their priestly brother.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:30.600000000

This became more torturing as time went on, until at last, when the bank was arranging to ship a large quantity of cash to the West to relieve the recent money stringency, he made up his mind to heed the solicitude of that specter which had haunted him. Listening to the instructions given to the bank's messenger as to the shipment of the funds, he hustles off to a gang of crooks in whose company he had fallen. He tells of the proposed shipment, what express, what time and where to. They are not long in devising a plan, and a most clever one at that. A large coffin box is procured and one of the parties is to be fastened in it in such a way that he can release himself at the proper time. This is to be shipped on the same train and to the same place as the funds, the others of the gang to go as passengers. Next a man is selected to go into the box. This is done by drawing from a pack of cards; the one getting the Ace of Spades is elected. By fatal fortuity it falls to the bank clerk. In he goes and is shipped off. The coffin box and the express strong box containing the funds are now seen reposing in the express room of a lonely Western station. It is past midnight and the last train has gone through. The station agent, making himself secure for the night, so he thinks, starts to eat his lunch in the next room. Slowly and noiselessly the top of the coffin box raises and out comes the man. With pistol in hand, he stealthily approaches the agent from behind. His first intention is to shoot, but, no, this would arouse the village. A blow on the head with the butt of the gun brings the agent to the door like a log. The door is locked. From the agent's pocket he gets the key, opens the door and signals to the crooks who are in waiting. They enter and at once start to break open the box by drilling and blasting the cover. Meanwhile, the agent, who was only stunned by the blow, crawls to his telegraph instrument and sends out a help signal. A terrific explosion and the iron box is opened, but, as they are taking out the coveted cash, they are surprised by the arrival of the railroad men, overpowered and taken into custody.

Few tragedies have ever stirred the country more profoundly than the famous crime in the Red Barn. The date of the tragedy, or rather the discovery, was early Summer of 1828, just eighty-two years ago. Wm. Corder, a young farmer, is engaged to be married to a wayward young woman, Maria Martin, and he calls on her at her home and makes an appointment for her to meet him in male attire at the old Red Barn. Finding that he is to be disinherited by his wealthy parents if he persists in his marriage with this girl, and being in fear of the consequences of not marrying her, from her brothers and father, he lures her to this lonely spot, where he has gone before and dug an improvised trench. The frantic efforts of the girl to get from his clutches and escape with her life are shown, and finally the actual murder. Wm. Corder then leaves the vicinity, and writes several times to the parents of Maria Martin how happy they are together. The mother of Maria is taken very ill, and during the course of her illness is seized with delirium, in which a dream appears, vividly portraying the actual scene of the crime. This scene is so vivid and realistic that she pleads with the officer to investigate, when the matter is discovered and Corder is brought to justice.	N/A	UK	N/A	2014-10-06 00:07:29.520000000

"Tis a wise parent that knows its own child," especially in a bargain day rush at a New York department store. The Joneses had not been blessed with a child of their, own, and Mrs. Jones is attracted by an "ad" for the adoption of an eighteen-months-old baby, and the suggestion is heartily approved by Mr. Jones, hence the young one is fostered. A perambulator is procured, and Mrs. J., the happiest of happy women, starts off for the department store where there is a bargain sale infants' wear. Now this store has introduced a new idea, that of a checking station for babies in baby carriages, and this is in charge of Percy Pembleton, formerly of the ribbon department, who was assigned to this position on account of his love for children, the dear boy. You may imagine that this being a bargain day in the infant wear department, there is a goodly number of dream disturbers in Percy's care. Besides Mrs. Jones, there came Mrs. Rastus Johnson, with her little Ebenezer; Mrs. Goldstein, Mrs. Fogarty. Mrs. Schultz, Mrs. Spiggeto, and a hoot of others. Each young and hopeful is checked and a claim check given to the mother. Nellie, the beautiful salesgirl, attracts the attention of Percy, and Bobby, the bundle-boy, seized the opportunity to switch the checks. As each fond mother comes out, she pushes away the perambulator her claim check calls for, perfectly oblivious and innocent of its infantile freight. When Mrs. Jones reaches borne Mr. J. is seated in the library. One glance is enough. "Why, dear, bow sunburned baby is!" Mrs. J. (hysterically) "Sunburned? Good gracious. It's a coon." Sure enough, In the mix-up Mrs. Jones carried off Mrs. Johnson's pickaninny. Back to the store, arriving just in time to see Percy take it on the run followed by an army of irate mothers. He is finally caught and punished. Each mother secures and folds her own toodlums to her bosom.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:08:10.243000000

Sunday night is a most busy one for the coppers, and the cooler on Monday morning is jammed with a fascinated mob of law breakers. Quiet reigns as we enter the Hall of Justice, for Bobby, the page, is in the land of nod, while Clarence the cop, who is addicted to the habit of smoking cigarettes in his sleep, is snoring that beautiful sonata. "Please go away and let me sleep." Regina, the scrubwoman, arouses them, and Bobby, with the bell, opens court. The first to arrive are Mr. Ignatius O'Brien and Mr. Diogenes Cassidy, the attorneys. The gentlemen are bosom friends and get along together like monkey and parrot. Then, ta-ta-ta-tah! The Hon. Patrick Henry McPheeney enters. He is awfully brutal to Clarence, and snatches the cigarette from his mouth, hurling, yes hurling it to the floor, curse him! The Judge has a large gavel with which he calls the court to order; also using it upon occasions on the heads of the learned attorneys, when they become too demonstrative. The first prisoner to be tried is Happy Hooligan. He is sent up so high it makes him dizzy; next comes Serpentine Sue, the snake charmer, arrested for exercising her subtle contortions on a frankfurter in lieu of the delinquent basket. She is sentenced for life, and should she make it out, is to be hanged. Two small boys are then brought in, charged with having shot the chutes. Diogenes' plea in their behalf brings forth such a flood of tears that the urchins float out on the tide. "O! Look who's in our midst." Flossie, the pride of the boardwalk, has been so indiscreet as to wear a sheath-gown and an overzealous cop pinches her: but it is easy for Floss, as his Honor's hitherto flinty heart melts like an ice cream block perched on the equator, and he himself escorts her to her auto. Scrappy Rosenberg and Izzy McManus are next hauled in for prize fighting, so are allowed to give a sample of their talents. A spirited bout now takes place, which concludes with the pugs knocking out everyone in the court and then beating it.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:28.897000000

We first find him begging on the. street, a young girl passes and drops her purse, which the miser picks up. When she returns to regain it he knocks her insensible and makes off. Finding a generous roll of notes in the purse, he goes to the bank to have them exchanged for gold coin. A couple of thugs witness the transaction and are at once infected by the money fever. They follow the miser to his home, the cellar, and while he sleeps they break in and are securing the money when he awakes. They pounce upon him and he is made to pay the penalty of his greed with his life. The thugs go to their own squalid hovel, which is presided over by an old hag. She is sent from the room and they divide the spoils. While the division is equal, each is invidious of the other's share. They retire, both possessed of the same thought, one waiting for the other to fall asleep. One lies with a pistol in hand; the other with a dagger. At length one gets up to stab the other, but receives a bullet in his breast. With a mighty effort he plunges the dagger into the heart of his adversary and both fall over dead. The shot brings in the old hag, who, finding them both dead, seizes their loot and in a frenzy pours it out upon the table. In doing so she knocks the lighted candle to the floor, which ignites the litter of straw and rubbish and the place is soon in flames, incinerating the three. A holocaust upon the altar of Mammon.

For the heart that truly loves can never forget. Such is the sad fate of the hero of this Biograph story. Herr Von Mitzel, a disciple of Antonio Stradivari, fell deeply in love with his pupil, the daughter of a wealthy English lord. His love was returned by the fair young maid, who grieved at the disparity of their rank, and wished that he had been more highly born or she more lowly. Oh, the tyranny of fate! What discouraging conditions were brought to bear upon their affections; but true love can no more be diminished by showers of evil-hap than flowers are marred by timely rains; so the conspiring circumstances tended rather to strengthen than to weaken their passion. Now, in the Winter of his existence, we find Von Mitzel alone and forlorn. His only companion and solace is his faithful violin, the strains of which are more eloquent than melodious, conjuring up as they do the recollections of life's Spring-time. We picture him seated at his cheerless fireside, playing his, or rather her favorite selection, and as the sweet tones float out upon the silent night, there appears on the wall a phantasmagorical portrayal of his thoughts, which bring him back to days of yore. The image of his inamorata is first seen; then the lesson on the harpsichord, when he declares his love; next the scene of her being forced by her parents into an odious marriage compact; then a duel with his rival, in which he is wounded. The scene dissolves into the reappearance of the girl. The subject is most beautiful and touching and is sure to win the sympathetic approval of the spectator, besides being a work of photographic excellence.	English	USA	N/A	2014-08-24 00:04:13.970000000

Hence it was that ...	Jack Morgan was a handsome fellow, but an outlaw, and although he worked in a most fearless, daring fashion, he successfully thwarted all attempts at this apprehension. Hence it was that the mere mention of his name sent terror to the hearts of the stage drivers of the mountains. Many were the wonderful tales told at the relay inns along the stage route that made the tourists shudder with fear as they resumed their course westward. Dick Stanley was one of the nerviest drivers on the stage line and had, as yet, escaped molestation from Jack, Dick was deeply in love with Mollie, the innkeeper's daughter, but, as our story opens, they quarrel and fall out. At this moment along rides Jack, who, of course, is unknown to Mollie. He asks for a drink from the well beside which the girl stands. The bright, cheerful countenance of Mollie makes a decided impression upon Jack, and it is needless to say that the handsome young bandit, well, it is a case of love at first sight. Jack drives off, and Dick, who has watched the proceedings from a distance, approaches to acquaint her of Jack's real being. She takes no heed of Dick, but is still gazing fondly at the fast fading vision of Jack so Dick mounts his stage box and is off. The stage arrives at a lonesome turn in the road when Jack jumps from the brush and, covering Dick with his gun, orders him to dismount, the passengers to get out and give up their valuables, placing them in a handkerchief, which he makes Dick spread on the ground. Having trimmed them, he orders them back into the coach and Dick to drive off. Then he gathers up and makes off with the booty. Dick drives around back to the inn, gives the alarm, and a posse of mounted cowboys start out after the outlaw. Jack, driven by the pursuing party to the top of a precipitous cliff, deserting his horse, climbs, or rather tumbles, down over the rocks, badly cutting and bruising himself as he goes. Reaching the bottom, he runs through the woods and comes upon Mollie who hides him in the well just in time to elude the pursuers who drive up. She sends them off in the wrong direction, and, when they have gone, assists Jack out of the well, binds up his wounded head with a strip of linen torn from her skirt and gives him her horse, on which he escapes. The cowboys soon find they are on the wrong scent and return just in time to see Jack galloping like mad down the open trail. Here follows a most exciting chase, showing some marvelous horsemanship. Jack has distanced them, but his horse runs lame, and he makes a heroic dash on foot towards a barn. Failing to open the lower doors, he climbs up on a rope to the second story, pulls up the rope and closes the door. The posse now arrives, and a fusillade of bullets is sent at the door, which Jack retaliates, laying out a couple of the party. They at length set fire to the barn, and Jack is forced out through the back, and, as he leaps, a well-directed bullet from Dick's gun sends him reeling to the ground, just as Mollie, who has followed the chase on horseback, dashes up, dismounts and takes Jack's head in her arms only to find him dead.

The waters of the sea have been infested with a band of gold-thirsty pirates, who pillaged every ship that came their way. Having successfully perpetuated one of their nefarious exploits, they are struck by a storm and forced to put out from their floundering vessel in a small yawl, in which they place a chest of valuables, for the shore. Thrown up on the coast by the voluminous waves, they disembark; there are three of them, the chief and two underlings. Taking the chest to a place of safety, they proceed to divide the spoils. A contention arises, and the two turn on their chief, who strikes down one of them at once, but is stabbed in the back by the other, whom he afterwards strangles. Gathering up the treasure, he struggles along, his life's blood oozing from the wound inflicted by the mutinous pirate, until he comes to the cottage of Wilkinson. A terrific storm is still raging and the poor old mother is trying to shut out the force of the gale when the chief staggers in. He begs her to hide the gold, which she does by dislodging several bricks in the fireplace and placing the treasure behind them. This is hardly done when the pirate chief drops dead from the loss of blood and the poor woman is felled by lightning. Hence, the hiding place is seemingly an eternal secret. What a sad home-coming it is for the son, after his success abroad. A year later, however, we find him a happy bridegroom and the sun again shines on the household. But eight years later he is stricken ill, with nothing in store for his wife and little one. The process server has seized the effects, and despondingly he goes to the kitchen to put an end to his unendurable existence. The good wife, suspicious, follows and just as he puts a pistol to his head she strikes his arm, causing the bullet to crash into the fireplace, splintering the bricks and disinterring the hidden treasure.

The wife wearies of the monotonous grind of farm life and is easy prey of a contemptible villain, in the person of Tom Roland, the ubiquitous "other man," fate ordains it so. The wife's sister is an innocent, good-natured tomboy girl, who never for a moment dreamed that her sister's low spirits were due to anything else than ill-health; no more did John. He tries his best to cheer his wife, and as he bids her and the baby a fond adieu in the morning on his departure for the fields, he begs her to be hopeful, that better conditions are in store. Scarcely has he crossed the threshold when Roland appears at the window. This decides her; so taking her wedding ring from her finger and leaving a note of farewell, she elopes with the serpent. At that moment the sister enters, sees the note and determines to save her at any cost. Donning her riding bloomers, and armed with a revolver, she leaps on a horse and dashes wildly after them, they having escaped in a phaeton. On, on they go at breakneck speed, both holding the distance between them, until the harness breaks on the horse of the elopers and they resort to a rowboat to get across the river. Down comes the sister, and leaping from her horse, dashes to the landing, and with the aid of her gun enlists the services of the old boatman to row in pursuit. Masking her face, that her identity will be unknown, she fires at the fleeing couple, causing them to heave to. Coming abreast, and flourishing the gun, she compels Roland to leap overboard and swim off. Then she commands the wife to board her boat, and at the landing, to return home. Here she makes herself known, and in a struggle the wife gets possession of the gun, when in rushes Roland and seizing the sister is choking her, when kin asserts itself in the wife and she sends a bullet crashing through Roland's arm, who at the point of the gun is driven from the place. The wife, realizing her folly, as John enters throws herself in his arms, he being in total ignorance of her experience and narrow escape. Once more, and for all time, peace reigns in the little home, thanks to Tomboy Nellie.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-30 00:48:54.450000000

Three thousand years ago there dwelt in Egyptian Memphis, the ancient capital of the Pharaohs, a wealthy prince, whose wife in beauty was likened to Athor, the Egyptian Venus, with heart as cold as Egyptian marble. The prince, worried and suspicious, seeks the royal seer, who tells him the princess has a lover, and in a vision shows him the princess in the arms of that lover, a Theban warrior. Instant death is the punishment meted out to the guilty pair. The princess is placed on a bier and carried out in front of the Temple, under the very shadow of the Pyramids of Gizeh. Here the High Priest, with a flambeau, sets fire to the pyre and her body is burned as an offering, with prayers, to mighty Osiris, beseeching that he overcome Typhon, who seems to hold sway. Alongside the pyre is placed a vase, decorated with hieroglyphics, which is to be the sarcophagus of that ethereal of the unfortunate princess. The smoke and vapor, as it arises from the body, enters the vase in a most mysterious manner. The vase is then sealed and the cavalcade proceeds with it to the tomb, where it is deposited and the door of the tomb closed, it was thought forever. Three thousand years later there came to the "Land of Ruins" a Boston professor, student of the illustrious Jean Francois Chainpollion, discoverer of the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics who unearthed the vase and took it to his home in Boston. Vague, indeed, was the story he learned about the treasure, and while sitting in his study, cudgeling his brain to lift the veil of mystery from it, falls to sleep, and in this psychological condition imagines the maid, while dusting, knocks the vase from the tabouret on which it stands. Bursting into bits, it emits a dense vapor, from which the reincarnate princess appears. Here is trouble. Our friend, the professor, is a married man, whose better-half is a buxom, unethereal person, who doesn't believe in the "Soul Sister" tommyrot. She, of course, wants an explanation, which the nervous professor is unable to give, so he bolts and runs hatless out of the house, followed by the princess, both followed by Mrs. Professor. Into a restaurant he rushes, with the princes at his heels. At the restaurant, as they sit enjoying a repast, the reincarnate Theban lover appears and claims the princess. This the old professor resents and is run through by the Egyptian just as the wife enters. Mortally wounded, he falls to the floor, from the sofa, for the scene changes and we find the professor awakening from a horrible dream, the pain of the sword thrust being induced by a severe attack of indigestion.

One seems to have had things her own way for a time, having been cast always for the leading roles, which opportunities made her the "public's pet." However, she does not wear the mantle of fame becomingly, for her success has made her petulant, peevish and selfish. On the other hand, her rival works studiously, and by her subtle art has won some attention, until during a performance of "Darkest Russia" she completely eclipses the histrionic luster of the hitherto favorite. In the Ballroom Scene (which is one of the most novel and pretentious ever staged in motion pictures) she simply carries all before her, eliciting thunderous applause and bravos of an enthusiastic audience, and the admiration of the pariahs and hoi pollois of the company. The curtain is raised again and again on the scene of her triumph, until she is called forward and a shower of floral tributes bestowed upon her. As may be imagined, this is viewed with cringing odium by her rival, who proceeds to the dressing-room, convulsed with rage, where the maid does her best to soothe her. At this moment the new star enters; her beautiful visage more radiant than the resplendent flowers with which she is laden. The offering of some of the blossoms to her companion, who has endeavored to suppress her passion, is the precursor of a stormy scene. The rage of jealousy fires her soul, and the recrudescent dethroned queen pounces upon the invidious bouquets, tearing them to shreds. What follows must be left to your imagination in this description, as it is simply indescribable, and must be seen to be appreciated. Enough it is to say the two women struggle and fight furiously until the stage manager, whom the maid has called, separates them with his time-worn injunction, "Be a l-a-d-y!"

The husband seemed content in the struggle, working at the factory for the pittance he received, but his love for his wife made the labor light. On the other hand, to the young wife this condition was most odious. In the grind of household duties, having, from force of circumstances, to do them all unassisted, she was like a flower withering for want of sunshine. Hence it was not surprising that she listened avidiously to the flattering platitudes of the unconscionable tempter. In the first scene we see her at the ironing table, while her husband bids her a tender adieu on his departure for work. Hardly has he left the threshold, when the grocer's clerk enters, and is received with an effusiveness most unplatonic. They at once proceed to enjoy a little lunch, the ingredients of which the clerk has brought in a basket. Meanwhile the husband arrives at the factory, only to find it closed down. Retracing his steps he arrives home, and seeing the window down and the shade closed, his suspicions are aroused. Stealthily raising the window and lifting the shade slightly, his fears are confirmed. His action, quiet though it be, startles the lovers, who leave the lunch table and hide behind a sheet hanging across the room. Entering, the husband, with gaze riveted on the sheet, picks up a pistol and sits himself in front of their hiding place, calmly lights his pipe and waits. At length he beckons, "Come out." (This is undoubtedly the most tense situation ever attempted in motion pictures.) The clerk appears first, followed by wife, and the reckoning is paid.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:21.303000000

Kate Nelson, a girl miner who has been working a claim in the mountains, runs into the office of the frontier hotel with the tidings that she has at last struck paydirt, showing a bag of valuable nuggets to admiring friends. Having just returned from the appraiser's office, and it being late, she puts up at the hotel for the night. In the office at Kate's arrival there is a Mexican woman who has just lost her money at Faro. At sight of Kate's gold she becomes desperate and at once plans to secure it. Kate is shown to a room, and is soon asleep with the bag of yellow nuggets reposing under her pillow. Suddenly the face of the Mexican woman is seen at the window, and she has little trouble in forcing it open. Her intrusion awakens Kate, but she overpowers her and gains the gold in the struggle. Kate manages to fire her revolver, with a view to bring aid, but all too late, for the thief makes good her escape, leaving behind on the door an incriminating mantilla, which discovers the identity of the culprit. A chase is made after the fugitive, the hotel clerk, friend of Kate's, leading the way. This poor fellow, however, is dropped in his tracks by a bullet from the woman's gun in ambush. Distancing her pursuers, the Mexican woman comes upon an Indian girl, who, with her half-breed husband, are camped alongside the river. The Red Girl bides the Mexican woman and throws the searching posse on the wrong trail. In return for the kindly act on the part of the Red Girl, the Mexican woman plies her wiles on the half-breed husband, not only taking him away, but inducing him to kill his wife. To this end they plan a torture. Binding her hands and feet, they take her to a large trunk of a dead tree, which overhangs the river, and here they hang her, like Tantalus, suspended between water and sky. With her teeth she manages to free one of her hands and with an ornament on her necklace contrives to saw the rope and drop into the water. Swimming to the shore she again meets Kate and her friends, and volunteers to become their guide in running down the miscreants, who have embarked in a canoe and are rapidly paddling down the river. Into another canoe the pursuers leap and are soon shortening the distance between themselves and the scoundrels, until at length they come up with them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensues, during which both canoes are capsized, and a terrific struggle in the water ends with the overpowering of the pair and arrest of the Mexican Jezebel. The dip in the river has evidently chilled the half-breed's ardor for the Mexican woman, for he tries to return to the Red Girl, but she repulses him, and we leave her and Kate standing on the cliff, enfolded in each other's arms, bathed in the golden rays of a setting sun. Indeed a most beautiful scene.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-05 00:15:30.597000000

Alongside of a beautiful mountain stream in the foothills of Colorado there camped a Sioux Indian, who besides being a magnificent type of the aboriginal American, is a most noble creature, as kind-hearted as a woman and as brave as a lion. He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp.

The Duke of Gloucester stops the funeral procession of Henry VI, woos and wins Lady Anne. Inside the palace, Queen Elizabeth and the Duchess of York are weeping over the death of Edward IV. To this Gloucester remarks, "These tears look well; sorrow's the mode. With all my heart I'll not be out of fashion," and he weeps. Plotting for the Crown, Crosby Palace: The Prince of Wales on the throne is visited by his brother, the Duke of York. He jokingly makes much of the Duke of Gloucester, who advises the two princes to live in the tower until the Prince of Wales is ready to be crowned Edward V, but privately intends that they shall never leave the tower alive. The Duke of Gloucester, now married to Lady Anne, wishes that she were dead. The Lord Mayor of London, urged by the Duke of Buckingham, offers Gloucester the crown, which he accepts, and immediately after orders the two princes in the tower to be separated from their mother. The Duke of Gloucester, as King Richard III, is now seated on the throne of England. He endeavors to persuade the Duke of Buckingham to consent to the murder of the two young princes. Buckingham refuses and he bribes Sir James Tyrell and two of his followers to smother them. Buckingham now claims his reward for assisting to make Richard the King of England, but Richard, in a rage, replies, "I'm busy, thou troublest me, I am not in the giving vein." Richard, with his army on the way to battle, is met by his mother and Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth, and cursed for his evil deeds. Catesby brings news of the loss of Buckingham's army and the capture of Buckingham, "Off with his head; so much for Buckingham." While Richard III sleeps in troubled dreams the spirits of those whom he has killed visit him and call upon him to "Despair and die!" They vanish and he wakes in horror. Closing scene: battle of Bosworth Field, showing death of Richard III, and the crowning of the Earl of Richmond as Henry VII, King of England.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:09:01.417000000

Griffith short shows the director's interest in Jewish ghetto life, portrayed here with sympathy and sentimentality. The melodramatic plot involves the conflict between generations in an immigrant Jewish family.	Ruth Simonson, with her father, is seen kneeling at the bedside of her mother, whose sands of life are rapidly ebbing. Realizing her end near, Mrs. Simonson takes from her neck a chain and locket and places it around the neck of her daughter, Ruth, with the prayerful injunction that she be ever guided in the path of prudence and virtue by this memorial. Commending her to the care of her father, the old lady goes to meet her Master in the Great Beyond. Two years later we find Ruth assisting her old father in his pawnshop. Mr. Simonson, although a money-lender, is benevolent in nature and his many deeds of munificence have endeared him to all who know him. Hence, when the local schatchen appears with Jacob Rubenstein, a wealthy suitor for his daughter's hand, it was his desire for her future happiness that induced him to look with favor on him. Ruth, however, had given her heart to Sol Bimberg, an impecunious bookseller in the neighborhood. While Mr. Simonson has no aversion for Sol, still to wed his daughter is out of the question, as his prospects are very poor. Ruth is determined, and when it comes to choosing between her father and her lover, she accepts the latter. Seven years later the little family, increased by a child, are living happily, when a fall from a ladder causes the death of Sol. Ruth, finding business cares too much for her, is forced to sell out to Rubenstein. The pittance realized from the sale does not last long, and poor Ruth is stricken down with the dread disease that carried off her mother. Reduced to poverty, she is forced to send the little girl to the pawnshop with the locket, on which to raise enough to buy a bit of bread. At the pawnshop, old Simonson recognizes the locket, and his heart at once softens, so he goes with the child to the garret, where he arrives just in time to reconcile his lost one when she breathes her last. Crushed and heartbroken, the old man folds her child, his granddaughter, to his breast, which forms the closing scene of a most touching and heart-stirring film. Several of the scenes arc decidedly interesting in the fact that they were actually taken in the thickly settled Hebrew quarters of New York City.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:25.287000000

He then falls fast asleep and dreams that he is at home with his wife. He asks for something to drink and he is given wine, which he does not care for, and he is finally given some bottled beer and a glass, but he complains that the glass is too small and he gets a very large sized glass receptacle, into which his wife and maid servant pour the contents of the bottle. As he is about to drink the glass passes from his hand mysteriously, sailing through the room and out of the window to the moon, which drinks the beer and the empty glass is returned to its owner by Diana, who rides below on her crescent moon. The opium fiend tries many times to embrace her, but she always disappears from her original position; and once, when he almost gets her, she has changed into a most ugly creature. He hurls at this hideous transformation everything within his reach. The scene then changes, showing the fiend, awake, throwing the different things at the Chinaman attendant of the opium den.

While our friend Benj. Bibbs was not exactly parsimonious still there were times when he kicked most vigorously against his wife's extravagance. Such an occasion opens our story. Milady Bibbs has just had sent home a hat and gown, for which poor Bibbsy has to give up, but when he sees her attired in the duds, he softens, for she certainly does look stunning. All is well until she turns around when, O, horror! It is a sheath gown of a most pronounced type. "You brazen hussy, to appear such!" He could say no more, for he fairly choked with rage, and rushes from the room in a state of turbulent perturbation; but not until he has ruthlessly thrown a floor rug over his shameless wife. The maid of the family is in league with a crook, and the pair have plotted to rob the place. To this end the crook has written a note to the maid, telling her to signal when the coast is clear. This note falls into the hands of Bibbs, and as it is simply addressed "Honey" and signed "Lovingly, Tom," his jealous nature at once associates it with his wife. "Aha! Sheath gown, honey, signal from the window, meet in drawing room, lovingly, Tom. I see it all: You would deceive me, eh? We shall see!" Into the fireplace and up the chimney he goes to hide, intent upon trapping his apparently perfidious spouse and her paramour. He is hardly ensconced when the maid, on order of the madam, builds a fire on the hearth, and yon may imagine Bibbs' position is not a pleasant one. To descend is out of the question, and as he ascends he dislodges the soot which covers him from head to foot. The noise induced by his scrambling amid smoke and soot alarms the women folks and several policemen answer their cries, who capture "Lovingly, Tom" 'neatb the rose tree in the garden. The women insist that the real offender is still in the flue, and a mad rush to the roof brings the coppers there just as poor soot-begrimed Bibbs emerges from the chimney. Chased over the roofs, he in desperation leaps off, coming down on the heads of a couple of Willie boys who are gossiping alongside a mortar box. Into the cement tumble the trio, and a sorry sight they present when the police and others arrive. Explanations prove what a colossal fool Bibbs has been, but still it served him right, and his discomfort is the spectators' sport, for the subject is a most hilariously humorous one, with a scream in every foot of length.

That season of the year when the Earth gets Old Sol's Capricornus and Sol gets the Earth's "goat," is especially fascinating to youth. Such is the time of action of the Biograph's latest comedy. Tis afternoon and outside the little old schoolhouse a furious blizzard rages. The earth has donned her spotless robe of white and the landscape presents a brilliant spectacle, but pitiless Boreas lashes in whirling directions the fleecy snow, heaping it up into miniature mountain ranges. School session concluding, the youngsters come tumbling out into the snow. Romping about, snowballing and like sports are indulged in, until finally they set to work to build a snowman. Around it they dance in high glee, and at length the little revelers depart reluctantly for home, leaving the snowman in abject loneliness. "The day has fled, and dismal night descends, casting her sable arms around the world and folding all within her sable grasp." Then the moon, fair regent of the night, rises ghost-like from the dim horizon, shedding her silvery light across the frozen moor, and seems to mock the cheerless solitude of the icy sentinel, until the good Fairy of the Snows appears and with her mystic want imbues him with life. At this moment along comes Predatory Pete, returning from one of his nocturnal expeditions. He has just clandestinely reduced the census of a neighboring henhouse by four fat pullets, which he has in a bag slung over his shoulder. Coming suddenly upon the snow-man, he is at first startled, but soon discovers what it is, and putting his pipe in the snowman's mouth, takes out a bottle to toast his frozen majesty, when, to his amazement, the snow-man is seen puffing away on the pipe with apparent enjoyment. Aghast, he drops the bottle and chickens and dashes madly across the fields, frightened almost as white as the snow through which he flounders. The snow-man picks up the bottle and takes a swig. "Nectar! What joy is here?" and he drains the bottle. Here is an oddity, a snow-man with a jag. Staggering into the schoolhouse, he finds the temperature too high, so throws the stove out into snow-drifts. Overcome by the booze, he lays down in the snow to sleep it off. Early morning finds him still asleep as the school children are returning to their lessons. All have entered but Sallie Simpkins, the village romp. At Sallie's approach Mr. Snow-man awakes and frightens her almost into convulsions. She darts into the schoolhouse and convinces the teacher and scholars that the place is bewitched. Out they come, and, guided by Pete, the coon, follow the vacillating roving snow-man circumambulating over the frigid, fleecy kopjes back to the point of starting, and find him standing on the very spot where he came into being. Cautiously they approach, and, led by the coon, make a mad rush on Mr. Snowman, who from the assault crumbles and falls into a heap of "Oh, Slush!" The subject of this film must appeal to you as being screamingly funny, while the scenic beauty is indeed incomparable and novel.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-20 00:34:38.270000000

Such was the power of pretty Roulette Sue, the belle of the mining camp. Phil Bowen and Sam Lewis were a couple of fearless road agents, and our story starts with them waylaying the overland stage coach, commanding the driver and his passengers to alight and "shell out." The passengers comprise a Chinaman, a tenderfoot and Roulette Sue. The tenderfoot is frightened out of his wits, while the Chink trembles so as to almost dislocate his queue, but Sue stands and views the episode with an indifferent air, while Sam covers the little coterie with his guns Phil divests them of their valuables. Sue has a brace of pistols in her belt which Phil takes, extracting the cartridges, hands them back to her empty and harmless. Her defiant mien makes a decided impression on him, as, on the other hand, he has, by his easy, gallant manner, impressed her; besides, a part of his features, which are unconcealed by the mask, gives promise that he is a handsome fellow. Well, it is surely a case of love at first sight. The deed done, Phil orders the coach to proceed on its way, while he and Sam go to their shack to divide the spoils. The coach, arriving at the camp, an alarm is given. and a party of miners start out for the bandits. Sue, who is in deepest sympathy with the handsome young outlaw, starts off at the same time, and, by a short cut, arrives at the shack and warns Phil and Sam of their impending danger. Sam, who has also shown a weakness for Sue, tries to kiss her, but is not only repulsed by her, but knocked down by Phil for the insult. Thus does she transform two staunch friends into bitter enemies. Still, there is no time to parley, as their necks are in danger, so they do a quick get-away. Several days later Sam appears at the tavern and renews his attentions to Sue. Again Phil, who enters at that moment, protects her, and Sam through jealousy denounces him before the crowd. Guns are drawn, and it looked for an instant as if Phil would be punctured in many places, but quick as a flash, he picks up a child from the road, holds it up in front of him, backs off out of harm's way and makes good his escape. Sam now figures the coast is clear and awaits his opportunity. But love knows no danger, has no fear, and hence. Phil returns to see Sue, although it is most hazardous. Phil and Sue are alone in the tavern when the approach of someone forces him to hide behind a curtain. It is Sam who enters and, with violent persistence, forces his odious attentions upon Sue. Things are becoming alarming, when a shot from behind the curtain lays Sam out. Sam, thinking the shot came from Sue's gun, raises himself on his elbow and sends a leaden dart through her which closes the blinds of her mortal existence forever. He is recognized, gives himself up for the usual punishment meted out for those of his kind.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-17 00:26:02.823000000

It would have taken more than the wonderful powers of deduction of a Sherlock Holmes to have dispelled the mystery that shrouded the disappearance of a case of jewels at the home of Robert Jenkins, a wealthy stockbroker, and although they were eventually brought to light, it was through a most remarkable accident. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins are getting ready for an evening at the opera, and. as usual Mrs. Jenkins is tantalizingly slow in her preparations, and is almost carried out of the house by the impatient Jenkins. Baby Jenkins is very much in evidence, and requires a bribe to induce her to remain contented with the maid. This Mrs. J. furnishes in the shape of a papier-maché doggie, the head of which is removed to find its interior filled with candy. Mrs. Jenkins is inclined to deck herself out in her diamonds, and takes the case from the strong-box, but in her anxiety to appease her husband's flustering, she hurriedly kisses baby and departs, forgetting all about the jewels. They are not long in the theater before the thought of the diamonds comes to her, and the awful possible result of her carelessness. She will not rest until Mr. Jenkins takes her home. On arriving there, sure enough her worst fears are apparently confirmed. There on the desk lies the jewel case empty. Good heavens! what's to be done? No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold! there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew. There are many sensational incidents in the course of the film, one showing the curb market of New York is most unique.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:27.067000000

Servitors stand awaiting the arrival of their master, who, appearing on the scene, throws his cloak to an attendant; unbuckling his sword, he hands him that also, then at the word of command the attendant throws them upward and they vanish. The knight then takes two large rings, a sheet of paper, which he places on one of the rings, then fitting the other over the paper draws it taut as a drum. Two attendants then hold the paper-covered rings upright, another hands a paint brush and paint to the knight, who proceeds to draw a face on the paper. This at a sign changes into a laughing, roguish character. The knight then plunges his arms through the eyes of the figure and draws therefrom bottles of wine which he hands to an attendant who surreptitiously drinks their contents. Making an incision where the mouth is drawn, our knight takes therefrom shawls, scarves and wraps of the finest texture. Taking the rings from the attendants, he turns it about to show there is nothing further therein, he hands it back and again draws this time four magnificent ladies' costumes, which he hands to his helper, He now takes the rings from the two pages and rolling them off the scene stands the boys in center of the hall, fuming them round he produces two other pages from them, then throwing the costumes to the four, who donning them are changed into four ladies who go through a graceful dance. Taking off the dresses, they change again to pages; the four become two and vanish from view. The knight takes a ring, ties four ropes to it, and, suspending it in mid-air, calls a page, who sits under it. Then from the ring there gradually ascends a fairy form, who at a sign again descends. The knight next causes a pedestal to appear, standing thereon he holds aloft one of the rings, which gradually lowers itself on the knight who disappears; appearing from another side, he takes the two rings, placing them edge to edge they form a cycle, which the knight mounts and rides away.

In the lonely wilds of Southern California there stands a rural tavern, kept by an old trapper, who had been widowed years ago; his wife leaving him a most precious legacy in the being of a pretty daughter. She was indeed the fairest flower that e'er blossomed in the land of the golden sun. At this tavern there stopped the honest, hardy miners and trappers of the neighboring country on their way to and from their claims in the mountains. A sort of a rest-up place for a chat and a smoke with the old keeper, and a mug of ale, served by the fair hands of his daughter. Among those who frequented this rustic hostelry was one of those proletarian half-breed Mexicans, whose acidulate countenance was most odious to all, particularly the girl. On the other hand, her blue eyes, golden hair and sunny complexion inflamed him so as to make bold to kiss her. He is indignantly repulsed, receiving a blow on the face from the girl which sends him from the place, scowling and towering with rage. It is nightfall and the guests all having departed, the keeper leaves for a short jaunt up the road, warning the girl to be sure to lock up during his absence, which she does: then going to her room to prepare for her well-earned rest. She has just removed her waist when there is a knock at the door, and, thinking it is her father returning, she throws a mantilla over her shoulders and opens the door to the Mexican, who had seen her father depart. The cruel, black nature of the brute now asserts itself, and barring the door, he seizes the helpless girl, who screams and struggles until her father, bursting in, engages the half-breed in a fierce conflict, while the girl rushes out into the night. The Mexican having with a blow stunned the father, follows after her. Next we see the poor frail creature dashing wildly and almost aimlessly through the thick forest, coming at last, as morning breaks, to the cabin of her nearest neighbor. Staggering into the place in a state of exhaustion, she relates her experience to the miner's wife, who goes to bring her husband's aid. Hearing the Mexican's approach, the girl hides behind a curtain. In rushes the infuriated beast in search of his prey. While rummaging the place, he is attracted by the childish prattle of the miner's baby, who sits in its cradle playing with her dollie. His heart is softened by the pure, innocent chatter of the child, and he drops on his knees before the crib and prays to God to help him to resist his brutal inclinations. The girl, who Is deeply touched at this scene, comes from her hiding as he rises and is taken by the hand by her persecutor, who implores forgiveness, which is granted, and departs as she takes the baby in arms and kisses it in gratitude, for was it not her deliverer? "And a little child shall lead them."	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-05 00:49:36.530000000

He arranges a dinner at his mansion in which they are all invited. During the day he wrote a letter to himself to be delivered to him when the entertainment was at its height. This letter, purporting to be from his attorney, tells that he has been reduced to bankruptcy by the failure of his agents. Aha! Now we see who his friends are. He was all right while he had it, but now it is different, and they all leave him to his apparent fate, "So this is what they call friendship. Well, it is as false as sin. But there is true friendship to be found, and I'll find it." So saying, he leaves behind his life of ease and enlists in the army of the low born. Securing a position as porter in a factory, he sees the other side of life: how those poor devils have to struggle for a livelihood, and yet how honest and open-hearted. None of that cringing deceit of his own set. At the factory there are employed a number of girls. Jennie Coleman, one of the prettiest, is offered an insult by the overseer, and Ross knocks him down for the affront. Jennie's heart went out at once to her protector, and from that time on they were friends, yes, friends, for true friendship is love refined, and purged from all its dross. They were often seen together, and little did Jennie dream of the real being of the man she put her trust in. It was not long before the arduous duties of the factory told on Ross, and he was at last thrown on his back by severe illness. In a poorly furnished room he lies, without those necessities so essential to his recovery. Here he is visited by faithful Jennie, who, finding him without food and other comforts, and penniless, she leaves him and repairs to a hairdressing establishment where she sells her wealth of blond hair, her crown of beauty of which she was pardonably proud, and with the proceeds purchases food and medicine. When Ross sees the terrible sacrifice the girl has made he deeply regrets going so far, and prays for life and strength to return materially this friendship. He is granted his wish, for they are married, and at the conclusion of the ceremony she is transported into what to her seems fairyland, clothed in gorgeous raiment and bedecked with jewels, with lackeys and servants in attendance. "True friendship is one soul inhabiting two bodies."	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-14 00:29:14.177000000

In this funny picture we see a young man who is possessed with an over amount of admiration for the fair son, and his lack of discretion in forcing his attentions on every woman that he meets leads him into many embarrassing positions, out of which he emerges as a rule much the worse for wear at the hands of a strong brother or father. The first picture shows him following a beautiful young woman down the street, and into an apartment where she goes to look at rooms. When the janitor shows the lady in the masher is close at her heels and tries in every way to attract her attention. His efforts are unsuccessful, however, as she utterly ignores him. But finally, so persistent does he become, that she, in an effort to rid herself of his presence, throws him on the floor and rushes out, locking him in the room. Soon we see him climbing out of the window and crawling along the ledge to another apartment in which a woman is seated reading. She is horrified when confronted by the stranger and is remonstrating with him for his audacity, when her husband enters, and mistaking the intruder for one of his wife's admirers, proceeds to give the innocent woman a beating, and follows the fellow downstairs, kicking him at every step. Undaunted by this harsh treatment, the young masher climbs up on a tram car, and seats himself between two women. He forces his attentions on one of the ladies, and at last becomes so obnoxious that her escort throws him down into the street and jumps down himself to have it out with him. The fellow overtakes a cab in which a young lady is riding, and to escape his enraged pursuer, he jumps in and explains the situation to the young woman, who is powerless to resist his entreaties, they soon arrive at the girl's home, and when they get out she tells her father of the stranger's conduct. The former not only administers a well deserved beating to the offender, but wipes up the thoroughfares with his remains.	French	France	N/A	2014-09-05 00:10:06.057000000

A happy idea occurs to one of the boys. He proposes that they buy, decorate the office and invite some of their chorus-girl friends for a good time on Christmas Eve. The plan is carried out. A caterer engaged, girls invited, presents purchased, and a tree set up. The janitor is engaged to play Santa Claus and give out the presents. On Christmas Eve Gayboy sends his wife a note, at the office, telling her that important business will detain him. The festivities begin. The trio arrives, accompanied by Tottie, Dottie, Rosebud and Dimples. The double quartet proceeds to uncork the wine and "whoop it up." In the meantime, Mrs. Gayboy has received the note, and decides to keep hubby company while he works overtime. She arrives to find the janitor in an outside office, about to don his Santa Claus suit. Quickly grasping the situation, she bribes him to let her take his place. Looking over the presents, she sends the janitor for a few of a different kind. She makes up and secures a place to witness the hilarious party in the next office. "Tottie Twinkletoes" is seen giving the latest dance from "Gay Paree." Gayboy is a close observer; his friends busy entertaining the rest of the bunch. Santa Claus is invoked, and enters with the presents. The mirth is quickly changed to surprise when Tottie, instead of receiving a pair of silk hose, gets a pair of wool socks, and Dottie, in place of the French slippers expected, gets a pair of brogans. The girls, thinking a coarse Joke is being played, start a rough-house. A general mix-up takes place, in the midst of which the mystery is solved when Mrs. Gayboy, discarding her disguise, leads Gayboy out by the ear.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:10:09.493000000

He resided luxuriously in bachelor apartments, surrounded by a coterie of agreeable companions. His social duties were that exigent as to prevent his working for a livelihood. Still the money must come from somewhere, so Reggie devised a scheme. His nearest kin and benefactor was an uncle, the Rev. Eben Haddock, who had often, in Reggie's extreme youth, lent a helping hand. The old gentleman was of a benevolent nature and Reggie felt sure of the successful outcome of his plan. Knowing that the old man's most ardent wish was that he, Reggie, should marry and settle down, he writes him that he had at last taken a wife, and of course Reggie's allowance was increased. This, in time, proved inadequate to his mode of living, and a second letter was dispatched that his reverence had been made a grand uncle, and another increase in the allowance was made. For two years everything went well, and Reggie was certainly tearing off the very best this old world affords. Nothing to do but spend Nunky's money. However, there came a jolt one morning, when Reggie receives a letter from his uncle stating he would arrive in New York that day for the sole purpose of seeing the wife and baby. "Good heavens. I must have a wife, but how." Well. Timothy Tubbs, the valet, comes to his rescue, and suggests that Mrs. Tubbs play the wife. "Fine, hut how about the kid?" "We'll have her bring along a baby." The scheme looked good, and Reggie telephones to the valet's wife to come to the apartments at once and bring a baby. Mrs. Tubbs, not unduly bright, thinks he means her own baby, a boy of fourteen. Meanwhile, the Rev. Eben Haddock has arrived and is anxious to see the family, but excuses are made, until at last Mrs. Tubbs dashes in with her boy. She is a sight, still Reggie must make the best of it: but it is out of the question to palm a fourteen-year-old boy off as a two-year-old infant, so Mrs. Tubbs is introduced as Mrs. Reggie Van Twiller and "Buttons," the hallboy, is hustled to the orphan asylum to procure an infant. While uncle is shocked at the sight and manners of the pretended wife, he is annoyingly anxious to see the baby. Excuses are made that it is out with the nurse, and will be hack shortly. At last the word is given that baby is here, for "Buttons" has returned. Reggie at last breathes freely, but his case is of short duration, for the asylum nurse enters with the infant, and uncovering its face, one look was enough: "Great Jupiter, it's a coon!" Likely enough, for the order simply said "a two-year-old infant," with no mention of race or color. Reggie feels that his meal ticket is irretrievably punched, so you may imagine his surprise when he sees that his uncle is not only amused at what he considers a great joke on Reggie, but greatly relieved to know that the awful freak was only a make-believe wife.

Manuella, a beautiful Mexican girl, is the object of the pure, honest affections of Renaldo, a poor Vaquero, and while she is touched by his tender attentions, she shows a decided preference for Gonzales, a dashing young musician, who, being the beau ideal of the senoritas 'round about, hence Manuella feels immeasurably flattered by his advances. Little does she realize that his attentions are induced by selfishness, for he knows that her father is well provided with earthly possessions, which he hopes to share. Rejecting Renaldo, she marries Gonzales. At the ceremony Renaldo, though an unbidden guest, approaches and, acquainted with the true nature of the musician, warns him to be faithful to his bride or beware. Gonzales treats this with extreme sangfroid, and when the guests have departed insists upon opening the marriage-box, expecting a goodly sum of money, but his rage is unconfined when he finds it yields but a sheet of paper, on which is written: "Her husband's love is the bride's best dowry." Throwing his wife from him, he departs for the wine shop, where he plunges into a whirl of dissipation with his ribald associates. To this place the poor wife comes to beg him to return home, but she is thrown out. Lack of funds sends him home to demand his wife's rings and bracelet, on which to raise money for drink. This she refuses, but is beaten and choked into insensibility and the valuables taken. Back he goes to his despicable companions. Renaldo learns of this, goes to the tavern to remind Gonzales of his warning, and a terrific battle ensues. With rapiers they start, but as the fight progresses these are discarded for more deadly weapons. About the room they struggle, wrecking the place, until at last Gonzales is bested by Renaldo, who, at the intercession of Manuella, spares his life, and leads her from the place.

Stuart Blackton	N/A	Florence Lawrence	N/A	6.1	9	N/A	A Saxon prisoner rescues his Viking's captor's daughter, resulting in his freedom and their marriage.	This story of Norway's early history shows Theckla, the Viking's daughter, reclining on a couch in her father's castle surrounded by waiting servants, listening to the music of a harpist, who sits beside her. The door is thrown open, a messenger enters and delivers a message, presumably announcing the return of Olaf, her father. The daughter bedecks herself to fittingly welcome the returning warrior. Passing from the castle to the beach below, Olaf and his followers are just embarking. The Viking is dressed in a costume of the ancient warrior wearing armor and carrying sword and battle-axe He ascends the path to the castle, his men following. Between two of them walks Alfred, a young Saxon prisoner. They enter the castle, where Olaf is affectionately greeted by his daughter, who dismisses the attendants. When alone, Olaf presents the daughter with necklace, bracelets and jewels, the spoils of war. In the guard room of the castle the captive is seated on a bench, with soldiers carefully watching him. The door opens and Theckla enters, with a servant, carrying food and wine. The famished man looks up at the girl gratefully, while she starts in confusion at the manly prisoner. Alfred raises her hand to his lips in thanks for her kindness. At this moment Olaf enters. His daughter lays her hand on his arm, points to the prisoner, and pleads for him. The father shakes his head. At this juncture the high priest of Odin enters, hands a parchment to the Viking, who slowly unrolls it. He reads, "Odin, the god of war, demands a sacrifice, and the prisoner must be offered up to-morrow at sunrise." Again Theckla pleads with her father, who shakes his head and points to the priest. He also is dumb to her entreaties, and commands her to leave the room. She rises, staggers and falls fainting in her father's arms. The following morning a procession of soldiers and priests, the captive walking between the latter, start for the temple, where the sacrifice is to be offered up. The prisoner is led to the altar and laid upon it. The priest takes a sacrificial knife from his girdle and is about to strike, when a messenger in terror rushes in and points towards the castle. The priests release Alfred and all start in the direction of the building. Over the rocky path it can be seen enveloped in flames and smoke. The young Saxon has outdistanced the others, and rushes into the burning building before his capturers are half-way up the summit. Inside Theckla is seated on a couch in deep dejection as a maid rushes into the room and excitedly points to the hall whence she has come. The young girl opens the door, but is beaten back by a cloud of smoke and flame. She sinks on her knees, raises her hands to heaven in prayer, then falls senseless on the couch. Alfred rushes in, seizes the unconscious girl in his arms and plunges out again through the flames. At the gate he comes upon Olaf and his followers, and places the daughter in her father's arms. She quickly revives, smiles in her father's face, and turns to her rescuer, who reverently kisses the hand held out to him. Again Theckla pleads with her parent, who grants his daughter's wish, and gives a command to one of his soldiers, who comes forward and gives a sword and helmet to Alfred, hails him as a hero and grants him his freedom. Then Olaf takes his daughter by one hand and her rescuer by the other, joins their hands and raises his own in blessing.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-09 01:24:24.630000000

The pretty daughter of a French-Canadian backwoodsman incites the love of a trapper who is so smitten with the beauty of this wood nymph that he purchases her into marriage from her father. The transaction meets with repugnance from the girl. She was entirely contented with conditions, a child of nature, carefree. However, she finds her pleading of no avail, and so pretends to accept the situation. The trapper and Canadian go into the cabin to seal the bargain with a drink, and while inside the girl closes and fastens the door on them and makes her way through the woods to escape. The door fastening proves but a slight handicap, and the trapper is soon in pursuit. The girl comes upon a camping party who give her protection, driving the trapper off at point of gun. The next day, however, the trapper returns and surprising the girl, carries her off in a canoe, beating her into submission. Her cries alarm the campers and the men start off to her rescue. Although armed with guns, they dare not fire for fear of hitting the girl. Finally the trapper, after cuffing and kicking the poor girl, ties her to a tree, intimating that there she will remain until she promises tractability. While in this situation the rescuers approach stealthily and cover the trapper with a pistol, force him off while they release the poor girl. The trapper shows fight and is knocked down and about to be set upon by the men, but the girl seeing her tormentor's plight, at once changes heart, and picking up the pistol turns it on the would-be deliverers, who retire in amazement. The girl then throws herself into the trapper's arms. Woman, lovely woman, you are certainly a peculiar commodity. The scenes of the subject are extremely picturesque, with their beauty enhanced by appropriate tinting.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-16 00:59:51.113000000

This is all very fine for Phlipp, who is wont to bask in the radiance of her smiles and to sip the honey from her rose-leaved lips. But, alas! his bliss is short-lived, for, the perspicacious Mrs. Phlipp grows suspicious and surprises the erring couple in an osculatory diversion. The meretricious maiden is put to right, and the sinful Phlipp is assailed with most vociferous vituperative verbosity. Storm after storm of opprobrium is hurled at him until with vermiculation his restrained rage bursts forth and he takes his spite, not by "kicking the cat," but by smashing everything at hand. The wife, meanwhile, has gone to the newspaper office to advertise for a Chinese servant malum in se. The Confucian arrives, is put to work, and then the fun begins. His services in the library are dispensed with by the irate husband. Next he visits the dining-room, where a globe of live goldfish excites an appetite which he proceeds to appease. He has devoured several when his piscatorial pleasure is interrupted by the housekeeper, who drags him around the room by his queue, almost pulling it from his cranium. Now, the affairs gastronomic are presided over by a lady who answers to the name of Bridget, is of pronounced Hibernian proclivities, and has a strong aversion for anything yellow. What happens when she meets the Chink throws the "Monkey and Parrot" story into gossamer oblivion. They get along so nicely together, baud multum. He resents Bridget's sangfroid with a mouthful of water, spraying her visage as he would a shirt-front. Oh, fury! "Going down?'' The Chink does; down the airshaft by way of the window, taking the sash with him, propelled by Bridget. There is a tacit understanding between Bridget and the Cop, so he makes his usual call and is being regaled with hot mince pie and coffee, when the saffron individual returns with a rat in a trap. At the right of the rat the muliebrity of Bridget asserts itself and up on a chair she leaps in terror, while the Cop fans the Chink, who drops the trap. The commotion brings the household to the kitchen in alarm. At the sight of the rat the women mount the table and chairs, while the Cop, hero of the occasion, throws the rattrap through the window, and peace again reigns. All this while there has been reposing within the incandescent walls of the gas range oven, a large succulent turkey, which during the hubbub is quite forgotten, and when the oven door is opened, there is smoke, nothing but smoke, which ends our story typically, as with many seemingly good schemes, this Chinese servant idea ends in smoke, and the Chink, like Othello, finds his occupation gone.

Scarcely has the poor bereft father laid the little one in the ground, when the war cry is heard resounding in the hills. There is an uprising and the chief is summoned to action. Tearing himself from the grave of his little girl he arms himself with his assegai and oxhide shield and is soon at the head of his band of savages, with sinister designs on the Boers. The Boers themselves have become active, and scouts have been sent out to warn those nomadic South Africans who might be on the road. One family, comprising a Boer, his wife and a four-year-old girl, are, however, trapped, and despite extreme measures to elude the merciless black brutes, are soon overtaken. Finding escape hopeless, the Boer leaps from his wagon, and sending his wife and child into the woods, seizes his rifle, in the vain hope of holding the savages at bay while the woman and child seek a place of safety. There is a shower of assegais, one of which pierces the poor fellow, dropping him into the road. Up rush the prancing, jibbing, gibbering barbarians. Finding the man dead, they rush on to find the others. The distracted woman hides the girl in a niche in the rooks, while she goes to find some avenue of escape, but she is at once apprehended and taken by the band to their camp, their chief remaining behind. The baby now comes forward to appeal to the Zulu, who is so reminded by her of his own lost treasure that his cruel nature at once softens as the little one offers her dollie as ransom for her mother. The chief is so moved that he vows to save the mother's life, if it costs him his own. Placing the little one in a crevice in the rocks, where she soon falls asleep, he goes to find the mother. Arriving at the camp, he demands the release of the woman, which his followers grant with protests. Back he goes to get the child, but the wily devils have anticipated him and carried her off. He soon overtakes them, however, and after slaying three in a terrific conflict, delivers the child to its mother, and then sees them safely to their destination. The subject is a beautiful story of parental affection, portrayed in a most novel manner, besides being intensely thrilling.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-17 00:42:02.520000000

The dentil of the first horn, at the age of two, left the couple almost inconsolable, and the little toy dog, which the baby held in its arms, in its last moments, was indeed a cherished remembrance. Seven years after the husband became so deeply engrossed in his business affairs as to neglect to some extent his wife and second child, a girl of six. The wife complaining of his indifference, a quarrel ensues. She decides to leave him. Arrangements for a separation are made, and a division of effects takes place. Everything is disposed of when the little girl picks up the toy dog of her dead and gone brother, and says, "Mamma, who takes this?" Well the scene that transpires defies description and it is sufficient to say that it is the most touching episode ever portrayed. The separation does not take place.

At the Italian boarding house the male boarders were all smitten with the charms of Minnie, the landlady's pretty daughter, but she was of a poetic turn of mind and her soul soared above plebeianism and her aspirations were romantic. Most persistent among her suitors was Grigo, a coarse Sicilian, whose advances were odiously repulsive. The arrival at the boarding house from the old country of Giuseppe Cassella, the violinist, filled the void in her yearning heart. Romantic, poetic and a talented musician, Giuseppe was indeed a desirable husband for Minnie. All this, of course, filled Grigo with bitter hatred and he vows vengeance, which you may be sure he will work with extreme subtlety. All preparations are made for the wedding, and when the day arrives Grigo is ready for it. He has contrived an infernal machine with a pistol so arranged that its explosion means death to anyone standing in front of it. The little church is decorated in honor of the affair and Grigo, with subterfuge, gets the sexton out, leaving the place to himself. Sawing a hole in front of the altar step, he places his weapon in such a position that one step forward by the priest would mean death to the bride kneeling in front. Grigo rushes hack to his room, arriving just as the wedding party is leaving for the church. Here he becomes a victim of the frenzy of his mind, and appreciating the fact that the awful deed will he laid to him and his apprehension will be inevitable, he writes a gloating note and then takes poison. His fall is heard by the housemaid, who, discovering the note, gives it to a policeman, who rushes madly to the church. Fate, however, seems to conspire, and the officer falls, breaking his ankle, just outside the church. A newsboy, seeing his plight, runs up, and the policeman directs him hurriedly to the church, where he arrives just in time to save the couple, who start back at his yell, for the priest had just made the step which fires the gun, but with no harm done. The priest gives thanks to God for their deliverance and proceeds with the wedding.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-30 00:19:08.587000000

The story tells of the young widowed mother of two children who is forced by extreme poverty to part with one of her children, a baby girl, by placing it in a basket on the door steps of a wealthy banker. Before leaving the baby the poor mother takes one of its little shoes to keep as a memento. Returning to her cheerless home she is seized with a paroxysm and falls lifeless in a chair, with her little boy at her side. A neighbor hearing her cries runs for the parish priest, who finds the poor woman beyond human aid. Her soul has departed into eternity. She still clutches the little shoe which mutely tells the woman's sad story. The good priest takes the boy as well as his sister's shoe. Meanwhile the baby has been found by the banker and his wife and they decide to adopt it. Fifteen years elapse and we find the girl grown up in blissful ignorance of her origin, of course imagining the banker and his wife her parents, while the boy has gone through his collegiate course preparatory to Holy Orders. One afternoon while walking in the park the boy's attention is attracted by a runaway, and leaping to the roadway he seizes the bridle of a wild fractious horse and brings it to a standstill. Assisting the young lady occupant of the vehicle to a taxicab he escorts her to her home. A strong friendship between the two young people ripens later to love and the boy is seen struggling between the all-important questions as to his future, whether it be religious or secular. His love for the girl is so strong, so pure, that he determines to gain the old priest's consent to his marrying instead of entering the priesthood. What a blow it is to the good old father, but he feels it may be for the best and consents even to marry them. Now the banker's wife thinks it only just to the young people to reveal the truth about the girl, telling how she found her fifteen years before, and that one of her little shoes was missing. At this intelligence the old priest is staggered, for he sees at once that the marriage cannot take place; they are brother and sister. He raises his head in thanksgiving for the grace of God that brought about this timely revelation. However, brother and sister find "The peace that passeth all understanding." She becomes a nun and he goes to his ordination into the priesthood, giving their future lives up to the honor and glory of the Divine Master whose guiding hand showed the better way.

She secretly approves the clean-cut young Englishman, but Betty is a sad little flirt and she thinks it never would do to let him perceive the impression he has made. To hide her real feelings she is inclined to hector him a bit and delights in putting his love to the test. They are walking by the lake when Betty decides that she desires some water lilies, well knowing that there are none within reach of the shore and that no boat is at hand. Basil, nothing daunted, strides into the water and gathers a double handful. All would have been well, but, in returning to shore, Basil has the misfortune to step upon a sunken log, which turns under his tread and causes him to lose his balance. He is a sorry sight when he reaches the shore and triumphantly presents his lilies to Betty. As they turn toward the house, Cecil Gilman, a visitor to the Kenyons, is presented to her, and she accepts his escort, a little bit ashamed of the bedraggled appearance of Howard and more than willing to tease him by mildly flirting with the newcomer. Men from the city are particularly attractive to those who live apart from the whirl of town life, and Gilman makes rapid progress in his flirtation with Betty, who delights in tormenting the man she really loves. At the County Ball she ignores the evidence of her programme to dance Basil's single dance with the Londoner, and a quarrel is the result, Basil vowing that he never will speak to so fickle a woman again. There has been an epidemic of burglaries in the vicinity of the Kenyon estate, and when Squire Kenyon is called to London on business he is glad that he leaves for the protection of his household so brave a man as Gilman declared himself to be. That night Basil, strolling through the grounds and taking a mournful delight in looking at the light in Betty's window, surprises the housebreakers entering the Kenyon home. He follows them and arrives upon the scene just as Betty and her mother have been thrown aside by the thieves, who are throttling Gilman. Basil's opportune arrival turns the tables for a moment, but one of the intruders uses his gun. Basil is wounded and things begin to look dark again, but the shots have alarmed the police who come to the rescue of the household. The last scene shows Basil able to be about again, and Betty shyly confesses that he is her choice and that she flirted with Gilman merely to rouse his jealousy, the scene closing on a pretty tableau of the betrothal.

Frank is the model "good child" of the village, loved by his father and mother for his good behavior, while John is just the opposite, being unruly to his elders, always into mischief, and bringing mortification to his despairing parents. Ten years elapse, and we find John sowing his wild oats, while Frank obtains employment in a broker's office. While he stays late at the office nights, John entertains chorus girls at midnight suppers. John's conduct finally exasperates his father, and one night when he comes home intoxicated he is ordered from the house and told never to return until he has proven himself a man. During the twenty years that follow, Frank accumulates a vast fortune, but his extreme selfishness and miserliness causes him to neglect his parents, who are now growing old. Unable to pay the mortgage on their little home, the father and mother call at their son's Wall Street office with the hope of securing aid from him. They find the broker very busy, at first declining to give them audience and finally insulting the old gentleman by sarcastically handing him a small coin when the father tells him of their need. Cursing his son for his base ingratitude, the father takes the mother away. Nothing is left for them but the poorhouse. They are taken there and given shelter, while their son, who had been such a model youth, lives in luxury, laughing at the scoring the newspapers give him for the ill treatment of his aged parents. But away out West, John Roberts, now a millionaire mine owner, reads the news of his parents' plight; his big heart melts and he makes all haste to return East. Going to the poorhouse, he makes himself known to his father and mother and takes them away, promising them a home with him. When he hears the story of his brother's conduct he resolves to punish him. Knowing the man's greed for money and power, at an opportune moment he steps into the wheat pit and arrays himself against the erstwhile Wheat King. This scene, "Brother Against Brother." is one of intense interest and excitement. Surrounded by money-mad brokers and speculators, the two brothers fight it out, John staking his rich mine against the vast wealth of his brother. At the stroke of the closing gong, Frank Roberts is no longer the King of Wall Street, but a. penniless beggar. The happy reunion of father, mother and their long-lost son makes a pretty sequel to this most interesting picture.	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-12-09 00:43:18.330000000

Griffith	Harry Solter, George Gebhardt, Florence Lawrence, David Miles	N/A	5.0	12	N/A	An unscrupulous tourist plots to steal the famous diamond, "The Light of the World," tricking a young woman into helping him. She is caught and imprisoned, while he prepares to sell the diamond and make his getaway.	It was at the City of Cawnpore on a feast day that the faithful assembled in the temple to worship at the shrine of Brahma, the first person of the Hindu triune God, comprising Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, sometimes called the Brahmin Trinity. In this Hindu pantheon there gathered natives of the Ganges Valley of all castes, with the priests, their wives, and houris; also a generous sprinkling of Western tourists, they being drawn thither by their thirst for sight-seeing. Most kaleidoscopic was the scene as out of its midst towered the stately idol Brahma. In the forehead of the idol there was embedded a mammoth diamond of fabulous value. This was termed the "Light of the World." Among the tourists there is one who, a stranger in a strange land, finds himself in a depleted condition as regards finances. Extravagant and improvident, he is piling up a bill at the Cawnpore Hotel without funds to meet it. The sight of this diamond at once arouses his cupidity and he determines to secure it at any hazard. A visit to the temple shows that the Brahma is attended by one veiled guard. He also learns that this guard has a sweetheart who visits him during his lonely vigil. Enlisting the services of an unscrupulous Hindu they follow the girl to her home where they force her and her father to go with them to the temple, where under threat of her father's murder she gives drugged wine to her lover, the guard. He immediately falls into a stupor, and binding the father and girl, the tourist seizes the diamond and makes his way back to the hotel. Recovering his senses, the guard gives alarm, and he and the girl are taken to prison where he is doomed to die at the end of three days for the desecration of Brahma. The girl, however, offers to remain hostage if her lover be allowed to search for the diamond. This noble offer is accepted and the girl is chained to the floor of the dungeon, while the guard, humiliated by the confiscation of his royal turban, according to the law, is set free to bring back if he can the diamond. Should he not succeed in the allotted time, three days, the girl will pay the penalty with her life. He first rushes to the Yogi, the royal seer, who shows him on the mystic mirror the face of the robber. The guard at once recognizes him as the tourist who had visited the temple, and sets out to find him, which he does at the hotel, just after the tourist has sewed the diamond up in the handle of his suit case. He contrives to engage himself as a servant and as such makes a fruitless search of the tourist's effects, He is on the point of despairing when the tourist is called upon by a diamond merchant.

After the united powers of Europe had been successful in defeating Napoleon's vast armies, the great Emperor himself was taken prisoner and sent into exile to the Island of Elba, on the coast of Corsica. His loyal friends in France, however, would not rest, and were untiring in their efforts to liberate the Emperor from his prison. The first part of this film depicts a meeting of a few of these friends and supporters, who formulate a plan. A letter is written to Napoleon, explaining that a messenger will bring him all particulars and plans of a plot to liberate him. A young officer is elected to make the dangerous journey to Elba, to carry to Napoleon the message from his friends. But these friends did not count on the enemies which every great man has, and did not observe that one of them attended their eventful meeting. The traitor informs the police, whose assistance he obtains, and together they go in pursuit of the messenger. Tired and exhausted, the messenger finds rest for a night at a small inn on the road, but not long after his arrival there his two pursuers arrive also, and over a glass of wine discuss how they can best capture the messenger. The daughter of the innkeeper, a great admirer of Napoleon, overhears the discussion of the two men, and immediately warns the messenger, who has just sufficient time to ride away, hotly pursued by the enemies. Fortunately, he soon reaches a farm house on his way, and induces the farmer to give him other clothes. Hastily changing his dress, and with the assistance of the farmer, who shows the pursuers the wrong way, he manages to get to the frontier. He arrives safely at the coast, from which he is to take the boat to Elba. Before he lands on the coast of the island, his small craft is demolished by the waves, and he is compelled to swim through the foaming sea to his destination. But even here, on this lonely island, he is discovered by a sentry, who uses his rifle effectively, and with a bullet-wound in his shoulder the poor messenger turns back into the water, pretending to be killed. Swimming to a more secluded spot along the coast, he sees the figure of his beloved Emperor standing by the water, looking sadly in the direction of his country. Trembling with excitement, the brave messenger approaches Napoleon and delivers to him the message. Napoleon, deeply moved by the loyalty of his friends, thanks the messenger in kind words, and embraces him, to show his deep and sincere gratitude.	N/A	Denmark	N/A	2015-01-20 00:42:38.550000000

When the blackmailer breaks into his house, Henry apprehends him at gunpoint and takes the opportunity to rid himself of the blackmailer's threat.	A thrilling story of an attempt at blackmail. How many of us are wont to look back and wish that we might blot out from our memory the ever recurring specter of the follies of our youth. Such was the experience of Henry J. Newman, a wealthy banker, who, in the flippant Spring of his life was guilty of a slight indiscretion which now in the sober Autumn of his existence seems so iniquitous that he fain would forget it, and above all keep it from knowledge of his family, not that it was enormous, for it was not, as Newman was a man whose standard of morals was high. However, this one false step was known of by Dick Folson, an unconscionable wretch, who, knowing Newman's sensitive nature, sees in the episode an elegant chance for graft, or rather blackmail, which he proceeds to take advantage of. He writes a letter to Newman telling him he has convincing proof of the affair and asking if it is worth to him $300 a month to keep mum. If not Mrs. Newman will be apprised of all. The letter arrives at a most opportune time to lend success to Folson's design, for Newman is surrounded by his little family, enjoying to the extreme mellifluous domesticity. He goes to his office and sends an answer to Folson saying that his demand is unreasonable and begging him to have pity. Folson writes an answer, but on second thought goes to Newman's office himself and to Newman's entreaties simply replies that it is either $300 a month, the first payment at once, or he will expose him to his wife. Newman at length yields and Folson goes away satisfied for the month at least. The money does not last long under the strain of Folson's dissipations and a week later finds him broke again. In this condition he is visited by one of his companions, who is setting out on a burglaring expedition and wants his assistance. In his present frame of mind he is ready for anything, and so readily consents, not even bothering to inquire where the job is to he pulled off. Arriving at the house they effect an entrance, and get to work gathering in the articles of value. It is not long before they are surprised by someone coming, and start to beat a hasty retreat. One of them gets out, but Folson stumbles and falls and the man of the house is on him, with revolver in hand. Folson scrambles to his feet and finds himself face to face with Newman. For a moment he feels easy, as he assumes he is safe, hut the awful reality dawns on him when Newman tells him he can now without compunction put him out of the way forever, for is he not a burglar? And is it not perfectly reasonable for him to shoot him as such? Well yon may he sure that Newman does not let slip this opportunity of assuring himself and his family peace of mind from now on, so when the police carry off the inanimate form of the intruder.

Howard Norris, a fortune-spoiled young man, spends his time with a party of reckless youths who are attracted by his freedom with his money, and hence do their best to keep him entertained according to their own standard. Drinking and auto speeding forms the principal occupation of those who have nothing but money and time at their disposition. On one of their auto rides Norris meets a pretty simple country girl, who is artlessness personified. She sits on the porch of her humble home endeavoring to arrange her raven tresses as she sees pictured before her in the fashion paper. The old father sits by admiring her who is all in all to him. Norris alights and asks for a drink of water, and the girl's simplicity induces his dangerous attentions. A second visit is made, and he prevails upon the girl to meet him clandestinely. To this she accedes, and with the aid of his companions, the young man plans a deception, one of his associates volunteering to play the part of the minister. The pretended marriage performed, the young man takes the girl to the Summer hotel at which he is stopping. Meanwhile, the old father becomes uneasy at his child's absence, and approaching the café the young man frequents, he learns the truth from the boasting, reckless youths, who do not enlighten him as to his daughter's whereabouts. Returning home almost broken hearted, he swears to kill on sight the young profligate who lured his child off. The chums of the young man arrive at the hotel and intimate to the girl the nature of the situation, and she demands the truth from Norris, learning which she flies out of the place to make her way homeward on foot. She has scarcely gone when Norris' mother arrives from a trip abroad, and appreciating the tone of the companions, she whispers those old-fashioned words of love and advice, the like of which he has not heard in some time. He sees what a whelp he has been, and realizing that he loves the little country girl, he hastens after her to right the wrong. Overtaking her in the road, he persuades her to go and be married in earnest, which she does, and they then proceed, accompanied by the officiating minister, to the old man's home, who now believes it has all been a mistake.

Confidence is the flower grown from the seed of true friendship, watered by the tears of adversity, and often assailed by the blight of calumny. For as Shakespeare says', "be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny." So it was with little Nellie Burton, the orphan girl of the rancho, who budding into womanhood, realizes her position and appreciates the low brutal character of the habitués of the Dive, even discerning the true nature of her fancied sweetheart, Jim Colt, who was to say the least an unconscionable villain. Tiring of her present environments she decides to leave the place seek a nobler and higher life. To this end she makes her way eastward and applies for a position as nurse at a New York hospital, and we next find her engaged in that work of mercy "ministering to the sick." Her mild manners and pure nature impress the head surgeon, a man of eminence in his profession, to such an extent that he finds himself deeply in love with this poor self-sacrificing girl. He proposes marriage, which she at first mildly declines, but he at length persuades her, and they are married. However, there must come a cloud, and this is in the shape of her girlhood sweetheart, Colt, who has migrated East, and living on his wits. He runs across Nellie in the company with her husband as she enters her own home. The low conniving nature at once asserts itself and he plans a scheme of blackmail, using as capital her pure innocent love letters. Waiting a favorable opportunity, Jim Colt "visits'' her and with a threat of showing these letters to her husband he extorts money from her. This gone he comes for more, and as she has no ready cash he takes her jewels. The money raised on these goes the same way, so he calls to make another demand. This the poor helpless girl finds unable to meet, and during their argument the surgeon enters. Colt then hands the missives over to the husband who, taking the packet throws them into the tire and has Colt forcibly ejected from the place, with the positive injunction never to return.

Later he escapes, but turns himself in so his friend can claim the reward.	After serving a long time in the penitentiary the convict is released and sent out into the world again; but, like many others, with the brand of Cain still on him. With crushed spirit, bitter against the world he makes his way through the streets, apparently shunned by all; in fact a social leper. However, there is one man who befriends him, and uses his influence to have him employed as a laborer on street construction work. He now begins to feel that life is worthwhile, but the very next day fate's treachery demonstrates itself and hopes are blighted. It occurs in this way: he is forced, through no fault of his own, into a bitter quarrel with one of the workmen, and in self-protection lands a fatal blow with his fist, and he is again seen in the terrible grind of prison life. Clad in stripes he toils at breaking stone, cuffed and dogged by despotic guards until his pent-up fury at last bursts forth and he makes a dash for liberty. Crawling and creeping like a serpent, and hunted like a rat, be finally comes upon a scarecrow in the field and dons the tattered garments in lieu of his stripes. Thus garbed his flight is more promising, when he espies a notice of the reward of $100 for his capture. Tearing the odious announcement from the post, which action was observed by a country boy, he wanders on, only to find he is still pursued by the armed guards, who had been informed by the yokel. Rushing madly on he finally comes upon a dilapidated cottage, which he deems a rather safe haven. Entering, he is astounded to find that by a strange designing of fate it is the home of the one man who had been his friend when he was released from prison. Desperate poverty together with the illness of one of his children, has shrouded the poor home with sorrow. As the fugitive stands and views the woe-stricken family his flinty heart softens. He remembers that the man was a friend indeed, when he himself was most in need. Here was his chance to reciprocate, and calling the guards who are lurking around outside forces the man to accept the reward for his capture. As he leaves the house the self-sacrificing convict falls a fatal victim to one of the vengeful guard's guns.	English	USA	N/A	2015-03-01 00:02:43.963000000

His demands are met with a positive rebuff, and when he becomes insistent be is forcibly ejected by Galora. As he leaves the tenement he vows to get even, and lies in wait until Galora has gone out on business. Climbing to the fifth floor, on which the Galoras live, he watches his chance, which comes when Mrs. Galora goes for an instant to visit a neighbor on the same floor. Darting into the apartment and raising the window he perceives the awful result of a drop to the ground, five stories below, and so evolves a plan that is dastardly in the extreme. Taking the infant child from the cradle, and placing it in a basket he lets it out with a short rope, the end of which he secures by letting the sash down on it, so that to raise the window would precipitate the baby to destruction. Not content with this he follows Galora and would have killed him were it not for the timely arrival of a policeman, who arrests him. Here he boasts of what he did at the home, and Galora makes a mad race to save his child, who is still dangling five stories from the ground; several times Mrs. Galora has approached the window to hang out clothes, etc., but was always called away by some fortuitous happening, until Galora bursts in followed by two policemen, who have given chase, thinking him crazy. They are now in a quandary as to how to rescue the child, for to raise the window meant certain death. At last Galora suggests they let down the top sash and he is held by the feet as head down he lifts the baby from its perilous position into the room.

He finds the neighbor gravely ill, and ignores his wife's pleas to come home and care for his own daughter, who has taken a turn for the worse.	In the peaceful valley of Stillwater there is sunshine. All nature smiles as we make our way up the lane, lined on each side with blossoming trees and fragrant flowers, until we come upon Doctor Harcourt, one of God's noblemen, seated on the veranda of his house with his wife and little daughter Edith. All are carefree and happy as we stroll with them through the barley fields, lanes and daisy beds. It is indeed a beautiful sight, a trinity of souls, each living in the other's being. But the fates are jealous, and there are gathering clouds to shut out the radiance of their happy existence. Little Edith is taken very ill and the doctor is at first inclined to think his wife is unduly alarmed, but upon examining the child he realizes the illness to be serious indeed, so much so that it would probably be fatal for him to leave its side until the crisis is past. While so engaged a poor woman of the village hurries to his home to enlist his services for her little girl, who she fears is at the point of death. Oh, God! what a situation. His own child needing his undivided attention most urgently, on the one hand, and duty on the other. Duty, that relentless deity of the honorable which so often compels self-sacrifice, beckons him on. Irresolute for a moment, he at length goes, assuring his wife that be will be but a few minutes away. Arriving at the humble cabin of the woman, he finds her child very ill indeed, requiring speedy and unerring attention to save her. Meanwhile, Edith, his own child, has grown worse, and the mother has dispatched the maid to hurry him back home. When the maid arrives and tells him the conditions, he for a moment wavers, but then his duty seems clear to him. If he leaves the poor woman's child, death is inevitable, so he dismisses the maid with the word that it will be only a few minutes longer and then he will return. Little Edith sinks rapidly, so the maid is again sent. This time he is about to leave, as the child is out of danger and will recover. So he leaves the poor family, happy and relieved, to rush madly to his own home. What a contrast! There across the lifeless form of his dear child lies his moaning, horror-stricken wife. A slave of duty, he yields the life of his own dear child to save the life of another's. The valley of Stillwater is shrouded in darkness. Such are the temporal deeds that will find reward eternal.

Several of the guests are put under the influence and made to perform most ridiculous antics, to their embarrassment upon reviving. The daughter of the host is the last to be subjected to the professor's power, and she proves to be such a good subject that the professor at once resolves to make her his unconscious agent in a dastardly plot he at once evolves. Opportunity serves him most graciously, for he meets the lady on the street and, hypnotizing her, suggests she return to her home and rob her father's desk of a large sum of money. The scheme seems to work, but it is an acknowledged fact that a person of good morals cannot be made to commit a crime, by hypnotism, and so, although the girl goes to the house, and even opens the drawer in which the money is placed, she returns without it. On her way back she is followed by her sweetheart, who assails the professor, but is worsted, gagged and bound. Back the professor sends the girl, he following, and at the home she somnambulistically leads him to the desk. He takes the money and leaves her under his hypnotic power. In this condition her father finds her, and failing to arouse her, calls the family physician, who at once suggests a celebrated mind specialist. He is hurriedly called, and using his powers of suggestion on her she is induced to retrace her steps, followed by her father and the doctors. Meanwhile the professor has arrived at his rooms and is hastily packing his effects preparatory to skipping; when the girl and her father, followed by the doctors and a couple of policemen, enter. The professor is overpowered, and made to resuscitate the girl, and taken into custody by the policemen.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-03 00:25:56.747000000

Of all the agonies of life, that which is most harrowing is the conviction that we have been deceived where we placed all the trust of love, and this is most apparent to Harry Colton, a young artist in the action of his wife, Mabel. It has been an arduous struggle for fame with poor Harry and when poverty's wolf is howling at their threshold he resolves to go out and seek employment which may not be as congenial as art, but will prove decidedly more remunerative. But his wife will not allow it. She pleads with him to hope on, work at his painting while she goes to seek a position as teacher of piano at the Conservatory, His ambitious spirit is compelling and he allows her to go. Piano lessons, indeed. The brave girl gets a job in the laundry at the washtubs. However, she has grit and with her first day's pay, one dollar, she drags her sore body homeward, stopping on the way to buy a few provisions. Dauntless, she goes the next day to give "piano lessons" at the washboard, and while away an art collector calls on Colton and purchases his masterpiece tor a goodly sum, with a promise or more purchases to come. His joy is boundless and he cannot wait until evening to tell Mabel the good news, so he rushes to the Conservatory, and, of course, does not find her. She has never been there: they don't know her. He stands for a moment paralyzed. "My God! She has been deceiving me. I shall cast her off forever." And rushing home he is writing a farewell note, when the door opens and poor Mabel is carried in a sorry sight to behold. She had fallen into one of the tubs of boiling suds and her arms are scalded from hands to shoulders. Harry, when he realizes the awful sacrifice of the girl, and all for him, is about to gather her in his arms, but she cries with pain, and he can only kiss the tip of her finger. The subject is a beautiful story of a woman's self-sacrificing love.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-13 00:24:15.820000000

Harry discovers what she has done, and races to save his fiancée before she eats the candy.	Harry Walker, a wealthy young business man, had been carrying on for some time a flirtation with Mme. Lebrun, a young widow, who, though he fancied as a friend, had not considered her very seriously. She, on the other hand, had mistaken his platonic attentions for love and when he informs her of his engagement to marry Mignon Parsons, she flies into a jealous rage, threatening dire vengeance. Walker does not appreciate the strength of her avowal, and leaves, promising to return to her her letters in his possession. But Walker little knows the fury of a woman scorned, and she at once sets to work to wreak a vengeance that is as cunning as it is terrible. Procuring a box of the choicest candy she injects a drug into each particle, and writes a note, cleverly imitating his handwriting. These she sends to Mignon who resides about ten miles distant, by a messenger boy. Some time after Harry calls in his automobile with the letters. These he gives to Mme. Lebrun, who goes to her boudoir to get his letters. While she is absent he sees the evidence of her treachery on her writing table. On her return he accuses her and she taunts him in his apparent helplessness to rescue his fiancé from her impending danger. Here he is, ten miles away, and the messenger, who has much the start of him speeding by railway towards the goal. Hurling the woman aside, with an invective of denunciation, he rushes to his automobile and commands the chauffeur to drive on, disregarding all speed laws, for it is life and death in the balance. On they go like mad through lanes, around curves, over hills, slowing up for nothing. At one point in the journey a toll gate is closed, but it proves to be no handicap, for they come on relentlessly plowing through the obstacle, smashing it into pieces. At another point a farmer's wagon is seen trolling slowly across the road, and the auto coming on at a furious speed, hits and demolishes it, and passes leaving the poor farmer ruefully gazing upon the wreck. On, on goes the auto until Mignon's house is reached. But the messenger boy has arrived, delivered his charge and departed. The box is open, the note is read, and the first luscious confection lifted to the lips, when Harry rushes in, dashes the candy to the floor and folds the amazed Mignon in his arms, "Saved."

But when Manuella overhears the daughter bidding farewell to her lover, he is so moved by their devotion that he cancels the debt.	The inevitable result of eavesdropping is at best a pseudo-gratification, for the listener rarely hears anything of a pleasant nature. An old Spanish Hidalgo becomes deeply involved in financial reverses and Manuella, a wealthy ranchero, helps him out. However, things have gone from bad to worse, and the old man finds himself at the mercy of Manuella, who, while not of the Draconian nature, of course expects his money or the security. He calls to apprise the old man that his notes are overdue, and insists upon a settlement, which the poor old fellow is unable to do. While there he meets Mercedes, the old man's beautiful daughter, and falls deeply in love with her, and offers to cancel the obligations for the daughter's hand in marriage. Now Mercedes is enamored of Carlos, a poor peon of the village, whom she loves in return and when the suggestion of the ranchero is broached she indignantly repulses it. However, upon realizing her poor father's condition she decides to make the sacrifice and consents. She then bids Carlos call to see her to break the unpleasant intelligence to him and part company. The lover calls and is almost heartbroken when Mercedes tells him the sad news. While they are engaged in the act of separating, the ranchero enters the adjoining room and through the half open door hears the sorrowful word of the last farewell between the young couple. He is so touched by the pure, self-sacrificing love of the lovers, that he softens and feels he is worthy of bitter reproach for being the instrument of tearing asunder two trusting hearts such as these, so he makes up his mind that such shall not be. He then enters the room, and bidding the young ones to be of good heart, he not only joins their hands in bonds of true love, but makes them a present of the promissory notes which he had threateningly held over her father's head but a few moments before. This is one case of where eavesdropping was attended by ecstatic results.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:00.677000000

Desperate from his utter helplessness to ameliorate his dying wife's suffering, owing to extreme destitution, he is in a frenzy of grief, when a raven is seen to perch on a bust of Pallas above the door of their cold, cheerless apartment. An inspiration! He sets to work, and that masterpiece. "The Raven," is the fruit. During his work he has divested himself of his coat, putting it over his wife to protect her from the cold. The poem finished, he rushes coatless and hatless to the publisher, where he meets with scant attention. One editor, however, thinks the work possesses some merit and offers ten dollars for it. Ten dollars for the greatest jewel in the diadem of fame - think of it! Poe thinks of the comforts, meager though they needs must be, for his poor wife and accepts the offer. Hastening to the store, he procures food, a heavy comfortable for the cot, and medicine, and with much lighter heart returns home. Spreading the quilt tenderly over Virginia, he takes her hand and gazes fondly into her sightless eyes, but the cold, unresponsive hand tells him the awful truth. "My God, she is dead!" and he falls prostrate across the cot.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:14.317000000

Johnson	N/A	5.7	10	N/A	A girl is being shipped off to Europe with her aunt to break up her romance. Her suitor dresses himself as the aunt and manages to fool everyone long enough for them to elope.	Dad was certainly "a wise old owl," and his subtle scheme would have culminated to his wishes, had Harry been a less daring lover, but "faint heart ne'er won fair lady" and Harry's heart was anything but faint. That Harry and Margie deeply loved each other is most apparent; that Dad had a strong aversion for Harry as a son-in-law is also apparent, and when he finds them in clandestine conference there is something doing. Harry is chased about the room by Dad with a cane, which in a wild sweep at Harry goes through a pier mirror. Oh, the woe of it. This might be considered ominous, and it was for Dad, but it was the omen of good fortune for the lovers. As an extreme measure Dad decides to send Margie to Europe with his sister, her aunty, to be out of reach of Harry. Bright scheme, you would say. Well Aunty's vanity was the undoing. She insists on a new and elaborate gown, so Dad gives her the money to buy it. Harry learns of this and follows Aunty to the store and buys an exact duplicate of her traveling outfit. Attired in it he visits Margie's home. Upon entering he is almost confronted by Aunty similarly attired. To hide he dodges behind the mirror, and oh horror, the broken glass has been removed. Here is a predicament. Aunty is approaching. Ah! an idea. Harry stands his ground and when Aunty comes to the mirror, she also not knowing it has been removed, he mimics her antics to a nicety, so she imagines him a reflex, and so exits perfectly satisfied with herself. Dad then appears and shoving a roll of bills into masquerading Harry's hand, sends him off with Margie for Europe (?), but instead they go to the minister's.

Johnson	N/A	5.1	8	N/A	A young couple must endure a tedious visit from their aunt until their friend offers to find a way to make her leave.	Tom Norton married Flora, the niece and young ward of Miss Matilda Scroggins, and in a moment of indiscreet good humor writes Aunty to visit them at their villa. Of course Aunty comes, and is accompanied by the Rev. Joshua Whittington, the gentleman who has done the deed for the young couple. No sooner have they set foot on the place than the trouble begins. First of all, Aunty and the reverend gentleman object strenuously to the candied affection indulged in by the young couple. Then they proceed to run things to their own Ideas. The cook does not furnish the table to suit them, so there is trouble in the kitchen; the servants are not alert enough, so they fall in for a share of the interlopers' despotism: and soon the household is in a tumult verging upon insurrection. At last a shaft of light breaks in upon the dark and stormy aspect in the person of Bill Corker, an old college chum of Tom's, who is the comedian of a show playing in the town, and he calls. Hearing the tale of woe of his friends, he volunteers to help them out. Well, talk about a "monkey and parrot" time: Bill plays the leading role in the funniest comedy he has ever done in the whole course of his histrionic career. Many things are pulled, but the climax comes when Bill, in a fire-eating cowboy makeup, chases the odious visitors out of the house, down the road to the railroad station, where they both leap on a moving train which carries them cityward, presumably thanking a benevolent Providence that they have escaped with their lives, no doubt to ejaculate whenever Norton Villa is mentioned, "Never again." So, though Bill was not a friend in need, he was a friend indeed.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:57.083000000

The money is discovered missing, and. of course, circumstantial evidence points conclusively to Marner, who protests innocence, and is given a chance of vindicating himself through that old superstitious practice of visiting the church and in presence of the elders in the vestry kneels and prays and draws lots. Fate is against him, and he draws the black card which declares him guilty. This is final, and his friends shun him as they would a leper. He makes good the stolen money out of his own hard-earned savings, and leaves his native village for another section of the country. Here he pursues his vocation of shoemaking. His trouble has made him a misanthrope and miser, niggardly hoarding the gains of his toil, guarding it with a jealousy induced by despicable money lust. A confirmed recluse, he spurns the advances of all: beggars are driven away empty-handed, with vituperation; in fact, the strain of charity hitherto dominant in his nature is effaced. His one thought is his golden coins; his only pleasure is the musical clink as they fall from his hands in counting them, afterwards biding them in the wall by removing a stone and placing them behind it. One day this is observed by a couple of thieves who peer through his window. Awaiting an opportunity, they enter during his absence and seize the money, making off with it. When Silas re-enters he sets about indulging in his only diversion, but what a revelation! The money is gone. Like a maniac he dashes out in search of the thieves, but without success, returning and dropping on his workbench in utter despair. Meanwhile, a poor, deserted mother of the parish, with her little child, wanders from her home in quest of her perfidious husband, only to die on the road. The child, alone, continues on the way, and entering Marner's hovel, sinks exhausted on the hearthstone. Silas arouses from his lethargy and is amazed to find the little baby, which toddles to his arms. What a change comes over him! Folding the little one to his breast, he exclaims, "This shall be my recompense." Indeed a fair exchange. That moment his flinty heart softens and he becomes benevolence personified.

The daughter overhears the plot and, disguised in the Duke's cloak, sacrifices her life to save him.	A free adaptation of the story of Rigoletto. The Biograph here holds up to your pity a court-fool, whose inordinate love for his child prompted him to plan vengeance which reverted upon himself. The Duke suffers from melancholia and his courtiers are at wits' end to dissipate his ennui. Diversion of all sorts are brought, but without success, until at last they decide to abduct the pretty daughter of the fool and bring her to the Duke. This is effected, and when the Duke sees her he falls deeply in love with her, but her pure innocence instills in him a higher, holier devotion than he was accustomed to experience, so he harkens to her plea, and throwing his cloak about her, sees her safely home. This is witnessed by the fool, who is in hiding, and misjudging the Duke's attitude, vows vengeance. To this end he enlists the services of a nomad couple who are dwelling in a hut not far off. He bargains with them that to kill the man he shall point out he will pay them five hundred louis. The pact is made, and the Duke is pointed out to them by the fool as he strolls in the gardens with the girl. As the Duke leaves the girl she espies the trio skulking on the grounds and follows them to the hut, where she overhears the plan. She at once decides to save the Duke, but how? To tell him would incriminate her old father. Nothing seems feasible but self-sacrifice, which she bravely determines to do. Going to her house, she dons male attire and with the cloak the Duke had loaned her thrown over her shoulders she bids adieu to her home and life and like a soldier goes bravely unto death. Entering the hut, her face hidden, she receives the blow intended for another and dies before the horror-stricken gypsy couple, who discover their mistake. They, however, put her body in a sack, and when the fool appears, collect their promised fee and flee. The fool is now in a state of fiendish exultation over the seeming success of his vengeance, and after dancing gleefully around the sack, determines to make away with it, but upon picking it up is startled by the litheness of the form enclosed. Ripping open the sack, the sight that greets him fairly freezes his blood, for there lies his own daughter, cold in death, a victim of his own dastardly plot. This final scene is without doubt the most intense bit of work ever done in motion pictures.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:10.240000000

She reasons: "Have I not youth ...	Fanny is the wife of Ben Webster, a trapper, and while he is an affectionate and dutiful husband, she yearns for something which appears better than her lot. She reasons: "Have I not youth and beauty and attainments far above this environment? Why should I be compelled to toil and struggle in this wilderness?" Truly, she did not know just what she yearned for, still a change of any sort would have been acceptable. Discontent is stamped upon her countenance, as Ben bids her good bye for a hunting trip in the North Woods. Webster embarks in his canoe, and sighting game, stands to fire. The light craft is overturned, throwing him into the water. Weighted down by his heavy clothing and cartridge belt, he would have drowned had not his plight been witnessed from the shore by Ed Hilton, a Canadian hunter. Hilton leaps in and succeeds in dragging the half-drowned trapper to land, where a strong friendship springs up between the two, and as night falls they make camp and sleep under the same blanket. Next morning they part with a vow of eternal friendship. Fanny goes to the village grocery store, and by chance meets Hilton, and it is a case of love at first sight with both, each, of course, ignorant of the other's identity. A second meeting is contrived and Hilton, thinking her a single girl, suggests an elopement, to which she consents. A meeting place is planned, and Fanny is there and leaves with Hilton his cabin. She has, however, left a note for Ben saying that she "is tired, and is going away." Poor Webster's heart nearly breaks as he reads this short, but cutting letter. Grief at first possesses him, then revenge. Taking up his gun, he starts after her. He hits a trail with the aid of a couple of villagers who had witnessed unseen the clandestine meeting of Fanny and the Canadian. Tracking them to the cabin he bursts in a few moments after their arrival. You may imagine the amazement on both sides when Ben finds Hilton is the man, and Hilton learns that Webster's wife is the woman. Hilton proves his innocence by commanding Webster to shoot; but no, Ben cannot kill the man to whom he owes his life, and so he staggers out and hack to his own home. Hilton, on the other hand, drives the heartless Fanny from him. She goes out, and for a time is undecided, when she resolves to face her husband and beg his forgiveness. Night has fallen and the cabin is in darkness when she enters. Going to the next room she gets the lantern, by which light she sees her husband sitting with his head reclining on the table. She assumes it is his grief, but on touching him, his inert form falls to the floor, he has terminated his existence. The shock causes her to recoil, and so doing knocks over the lantern, extinguishing the light. There in the shaft of moonlight we leave her kneeling beside the awful result of her discontent.

Extreme tranquility hovered over the Salon Litteraire of the Club Montmartre, and the members seemed to be in a state of ennui, the silence being broken only by the ticking of that horometrical instrument, the clock. when Mons. Leon Martinel enters in company with Mons. Gaston Tortoni, whom be introduces to Mons. Alphonse de Signoles. Alphonse orders le garçon bring a round of cocktails, and he puts an olive in each. This Tortoni objects to, but Alphonse insists, "Oui! Oui!" Tortoni then with thumb and forefinger extracts the olive from the cocktail, and hurls it, yes hurls it in the face of Alphonse. Consternation! The members stand aghast until Alphonse retaliates in like manner. Amazement! The feud is on, honor must be satisfied; a duel is inevitable, and speculation keen, as Alphonse is in the bantam class, while Tortoni is a replica of the Eiffel Tower. On the field of honor, beside the ruins of the old Conciergerie, they meet. A corps of trained nurses, doctors and undertakers arrive, and the seconds prepare the weapons, while the undertakers measure the contestants for their prospective receptacles. Muskets are first selected, but one of them accidentally discharges and throws the party into hysterics, so they are discarded. Rapiers are finally resorted to and a most furious combat is precipitated, which would have resulted fatally for Tortoni had he not had a tin tray concealed beneath his vest as a shield, and so the duel finishes to the entire satisfaction of everybody but the undertakers.

She displays it with pride to her husband, who bitterly denounces her extravagance. In a war of words Mrs. Bangs is victorious. Mr. Bangs leaves the house, seeking rest under the shade of the porch. The cook, ignorant of his presence, showers him with chicken feathers, much to his discomfort. Nervous, he decides on a quiet smoke in the dressing room. A match thrown on the floor ignites a pillow. It bursts into flames; instant action is necessary. In his excitement he uses his wife's hat to smother the burning pillow. The fire out, he finds that the hat is ruined. Hearing footsteps, and fearful of her wrath, he hides the smoking creation in the bed tick and escapes out the window on to the freshly painted sill. Doing this he virtually jumps from the frying pan into the fire. Mr. Bangs is smeared from head to foot with new paint. The painter is greatly incensed, but listens to the unlucky man's explanation of the situation. Unfortunately, in his agitation he overturns the paint pot. The painter's sympathy turns to anger. He forces Mr. Bangs back through the window and follows him into the room. Mrs. Bangs demands explanations, which the painter spitefully proffers. The hat is brought out of the feather bed. The sight of her ruined "Peach Basket" throws her into a violent rage. Ignoring explanations she seizes her unhappy husband and smothers him with feathers until he begs for mercy.

A gambler with a 'sure thing' borrows the coin and wins a fortune, but he can't find her again to repay her.	It was fête day in old Paris, and the city was the scene of gaiety and splendor. Contrasted with the brilliant throng we see a little child shivering in the snow, with her little wooden shoe held out expectant of a coin from those charitably disposed. But in the intoxicating jollity of the occasion the poor soul is passed by unnoticed until, exhausted, she sinks upon the stone step and sleeps. There now passes a kindly spirited knight, who flicks a Louis d'Or into the tiny wooden slipper at her side. Meanwhile, at the gambling house there has run to ruin at roulette a young blade, who is tipped that on the strike of twelve the number 17 is sure to come out. So impressed is he that he tries to borrow, in the hope of recouping his lost fortune, but his friends turn coldly away. From the place he saunters despondently and comes upon the little one on the step, still asleep. His hand, through habit, goes to his own pocket, hut, alas! It is empty. As he stands and contemplates the little one his eyes strikes the Louis d'Or. "An Idea! I will borrow the coin, play 17, and win her a fortune." Back to the hall he rushes, reaching there upon the stroke of twelve. Hurling the coin upon the table he yells "17," and 17 wins. He lays his winnings and wins again. Again and again he doubles his wealth until the bank is broken. Back he goes to repay with interest the "borrowed" Louis, but what a sight greets him. "Dead, and I have murdered her!" and taking the death-stained gold he scatters it in the snow.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-25 05:27:16.847000000

Inspector Brown at the estate is a wicked and brutal person, who is always quarreling with the workmen; but at the same time he is sly enough to ingratiate himself by sly words with the Squire's daughter Elsie, so much so that she, as the inspector one day is turned out on account of his brutality, follows him, giving up her beautiful home and her old father on his behalf. A year later we see her in a poor-looking room in a big city. Brown is now just as brutal to Elsie as he was before to the workmen; he is not even ashamed of forcing her to give up the last of her savings, although she is ill, having just been confined with a child. This money he spends on bad women. Twelve years have passed. Brown has long since left Elsie, who is obliged to support herself and her boy, Charles, by sewing. Charles now does not want to be an encumbrance to his mother any longer, and we see him leaving the little home to go out in the country to look for a situation. Accidentally he comes to his grandfather's estate; he is engaged and soon becomes the favorite of the old Squire. One day Charles in taken ill, and the Squire takes him to his own room and puts him to bed there. One night Brown who is now a drunken and disreputable individual, sneaks into the place with the intention to murder the Squire. Charles hears a noise, looks out of the window and is at once equal to the occasion. Instead of giving the alarm to the Squire, he snatches a revolver, which is always lying on a small table beside the bed and lies down again quietly, as if asleep. As Brown, a few moments later, bends over the old gentleman's bed with the knife in his band. Charles fires the revolver and the rascal falls to the floor severely wounded. Charles gets permission for his mother to come and see him, and, to this effect he writes a letter home. As Elsie receives the letter and sees the well-known address she believes her father has forgiven her, and hurries joyfully back to her old home. But the meeting between father and daughter does not turn out as expected: the old gentleman does not want to have anything to do with his daughter, but as his little rescuer puts father's and daughter's hands in each other, he cannot resist any longer, he forgives her and is now happy to have his two dear ones near him.

Hanging the dagger on the wall. Jack goes out. For some time Jack has discerned a coolness in his wife, and his jealous misgivings were verified when he returned and found her in company with a stranger. Seizing the dagger from the wall he chases the recreant lover from the house and then follows the wife to the bathroom, wither she has flown in terror. Mercilessly he plunges the dagger and flies the place. The lover in hiding sees him leave and returns, and calling aid succeeds in reviving the wife, who afterwards with careful treatment recovers and marries her paramour. However, either from the baneful influence of this diabolical dagger, or the woman's capricious nature, just one year later the second husband enacts the same scene, but with fatal results. He leaves the place, and has hardly disappeared when the first husband, who was thought to be dead, is drawn by an irresistible power back to view what to him seems to be the scene he left one year before, for there on the bathroom floor is the woman just as he apparently left her, with the dagger beside her. The sight drives him mad and the dagger is made to perform the final act of its mission.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:11.943000000

Duty is above all consequences, and often, at a crisis of difficulty, commands us to throw them overboard. It commands us to look neither to the right nor to the left, but straight forward. These were the noble principles instilled in the makeup of Jack Allen, the policeman. Jack, his younger brother Bob and their mother comprised the little family. To-day is Bob's twenty-first birthday and mother and Jack make him a present of a cap, with his initials "B.A." on the lining. Jack goes out on his beat and Bob leaves the house seemingly highly pleased with his present. During the evening Jack is called to the scene of the robbery of a jewelry store. While going over the place for a possible clue, he finds a cap, on the inside of which there are the telltale, letters "B.A." Crushed beyond measure he seeks Bob out at their home and it is all too true. Bob is inclined to brave the situation, and the poor old mother's heart is breaking, but Jack's duty is plain. Bob is carried to prison.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:57.397000000

That one may be killed by kindness is a demonstrated fact, but that dire deeds may be wrought by generous acts is a rarity. Jones does, though, with great success. But, then. Eddie has never fallen down yet, although he has gotten into some awkward positions. Wifey's mamma promises, or rather threatens, a visit. This, of course, is most delectable news to Jones: "not" and when she arrives he is further perturbed by her egotistical domination of the household. Son-in-law must not smoke, nor drink; the maid must not frill nor flounce, but attire herself austerely demure. To say that this gets on Jones' nerves is putting it mildly, but what can he do? "Ah! an inspiration. It takes nerve, but it is worth a chance." So he sets out, to make his wife jealous of her own mother. First he goes out and buys her candy and flowers, then he showers attentions upon her to the extreme neglect of wifey, which starts things in the right direction for Jones. After this he takes mamma dear to the milliner's and buys her a Merry Widow creation that is a marvel of merchandises de mode. All this, of course, costs money, but it is well spent, for the effect is very apparent, and the master stroke was struck when Jones takes mamma to Rector's and introduces to her notice that effervescent bubble water, champagne. Well, you see the stiff, prim old lady soften and become the giddiest girl extant. Back home they go, and it is all off between mother and daughter, and Mrs. Jones packs up mamma's duds and fairly throws her out of the house, with an injunction to go away and never come back. Of course, Jones is in bad for a time, but when he explains that what he did was induced by his selfish love to have wifey all to himself, he is forgiven and receives the usual "make-up" kiss.

They figure that if one could only gain an entrance, a rich haul would be the reward. Many plans were devised and discarded, until Grattan, who is a handsome chap, resolved to perpetrate his evil design by way of the daughter, Rachel's heart. Rachel falls an easy victim to the flattering Ned, and accompanying him to a dance, consents to his proposal that they elope the following evening. Ned arrives at the pawnshop after closing time, and is admitted by Rachel. While she is upstairs getting her things, Ned admits Murphy. Poor trusting Rachel descends to be knocked on the head, gagged and bound to the newel post of the stairway. Mr. Einstein, missing his daughter, comes down into the shop only to receive a like treatment. The crooks then pile a lot of rubbish in front of Rachel and saturate it with kerosene. On top of this they place a lighted candle, so that when the dip burns down it will set fire to the rubbish, incinerating the pair, at the same time allowing them to make good their escape, a slow fuse as it were. Up the stairs they dash and rifle the money safe in Einstein's room. Meanwhile, Rachel has worked herself down until her hands come in contact with the candle's flame, with which she burns the binding of her wrists. Her hands free, she releases herself from the post, and rushing back of the counter, takes up two revolvers, holding up the two crooks as they descend into the store, commanding them to put down their loot and forcing Grattan himself to telephone for the police, who arrive immediately, taking the thieves in charge, much to the satisfaction of Einstein, who is released and revived.

Arriving too late in the night to dispose of the gold, he seeks out the pretty daughter of the gambling-house keeper who has given her heart unto his keeping. While waiting for the bank to open in the morning, he becomes fascinated with the sight of the money being won at a gambling table, and starts to gamble with his boss's money. Luck is against him, and scarcely before he realizes it he has lost all. Ruin, disgrace, and prison or lynching stare him in the face. Only seeking to get back what he has lost he tries to rob the gambling house at night, and here he comes face to face with the little girl whom he loves. He confesses to her his crime and shame, and the woman's love spreads forth its hands to shield him. She seeks out Rattlesnake Jim, the Sheriff of Cedar Gulch, who also is in love with her, and implores his aid for her unworthy lover. A warrant for the cowboy's arrest reaches Jim while she is at his cabin and he struggles manfully to follow its mandates to the letter, but his love for the girl causes him to swerve from his strict path of duty and he decides to give the guilty man a fighting chance. Either he or the cowboy must quit Cedar Gulch at once. In other words, one of them must die. To live and not do his duty is a thought that has never entered Jim's mind. So these men of iron and nerve fight a novel duel in the Sheriff's lonely cabin, at which he has ordered the cowboy to report. Baring their arms to the elbow they sit at opposite sides of a table, calmly waiting for a great, poisonous rattlesnake to rise from its bed, which opens in the center of the table, and choose its victim. Slowly it uncoils itself upon the table with fangs darting in and out, it rears its head, the men watching its every move in fearful silence. At a moment when it seems that the awful suspense will be ended by a deadly strike fate interferes, and though justice miscarries, yet Cupid's arrow finds an unsuspecting but not unwilling victim in the person of the lion-hearted Sheriff, whose manly conduct, in contrast with that of her lover, reveals to the girl his true worth. All this is told with a wonderful dramatic strength and power, and one never loses interest for a moment.	English	USA	N/A	2015-03-05 00:07:01.723000000

They come to the farm house of Mr. Graham, where Jessie, his little daughter of 5 years, is playing in the yard. Bill and Liza approach the house and ask for food and money, which is refused by Mrs. Graham. Her husband comes from behind the house at this moment and gruffly orders the gypsies away.

Jessie dances, while Joe accompanies her on his guitar, and. when she finishes, Bill grasps her around the waist and kisses her. The young man drops his instrument, knocks Bill down and chokes him into silence. Liza motions the young people to get away, which they do, and a little distance up the road, she joins them, and from a bundle which she carries in her arm takes out some child's clothes, the ones worn by Jessie when she was stolen from home. The story of the abduction is told. Liza directs the girl to her parents, then returns to camp. Bill, by this time, has regained his senses and is sitting near the fire smoking and in a very bad humor. He inquires of Liza as to the whereabouts of the young girl, and, receiving no satisfaction, starts out to hunt the fugitives. As he mounts his horse. Liza knocks him off and mounts herself, and is off after the pair. She comes up with them after a while, and the journey home is at last finished. Graham and his wife, with a farmhand, are seated in the doorway as the gypsies appear. Liza goes forward and talks to Mr. Graham, who at first refuses to believe her story. She brings Jessie forward and produces the clothes worn by the child when stolen. This is sufficient proof, and Jessie is soon in fond embrace of mother and father. They lead her into the house, Joe following. Liza stands aloof watching them, then slowly and sadly walks away.	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-09-05 00:15:11.370000000

Johnson, Owen Moore, Florence Lawrence, Marion Leonard	N/A	4.4	5	N/A	John is seduced and abandoned by a cruel flirt. Later he learns that his friend Frank is engaged to the same woman. He relates his story to Frank and convinces him to jilt her at the altar.	John Hale and Frank Allison have become staunch friends at college, and the day of separation, at the end of the course, was a sad one indeed, particularly for Frank when he discovered that his little crippled sister, Mary, had fallen deeply in love with Jack. Jack goes out into the world, meets and becomes smitten with Miss Dorothy Kirk, a cold, heartless beauty. Dorothy had engaged herself to several worthy young men, but her capriciousness had caused her to throw them aside, so when she is sought by John Hale we feel that she has at last found her affinity. They are engaged and the affinition sealed with a ring, but the usual change of heart comes, and this time on the day of their to-be nuptials, when Jack receives the following note: "Mr. John Hale, Dear Sir: Am sorry to write I cannot marry you to-day or ever. Pardon delaying my decision until the last moment, but better late than never. Dorothy Kirk." At the same time returning his ring. Humiliated and crushed, Jack stood in his wedding clothes, hardly realizing the cruel truth. From that moment a change comes over him; the noble, manly, courageous fellow becomes in spirit a weakling. Down, down he goes, disappointed, discouraged and distressed, until we find him simply a drink-devastated, emaciated human frame as he enters a saloon to buy a drink. While seated at one of the tables he glances over a newspaper and an article strikes his eye announcing the marriage of his college chum, Frank Allison, to Miss Dorothy Kirk on that afternoon. Rushing from the place on vengeance bent he makes his way to Frank's home to give him that awful note she had sent him some time before, but when he sees Frank so radiantly happy he decides to hold his peace and crushes the note in his hand out of sight. Frank, upon seeing his awful plight, prevails upon him to stay. As he leaves for the adjoining room he drops the note, which Frank picks up and reads. He now realizes the cause of his chum's condition, and in an instant his love turns to hate, so he resolves to pay her back in her own coin. He writes a note identical in wording with hers, addressing it "Miss Dorothy Kirk"; signing it "Frank Allison." Feigning illness he dispatches it by Jack, who assumes it an excuse for illness. In he rushes in the midst of the wedding throng. You may imagine the scene. Here Jack unwittingly wreaks vengeance. On Jack's return to Frank he finds little sister Mary's hand held out helpingly to him.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-23 00:43:57.040000000

One night Jones enters the wrong house and finds himself in a precarious situation.	The Joneses have moved and taken an apartment in one of a row of houses which are identically alike. The most natural thing happens: Jones gets into the wrong house, and, of course, his intrusion is vigorously resented, and it looked for a time he would suffer bodily injury, but, as usual, the menacing clouds dissipate and peace again reigns in the Jones domicile.

Cumpson, Florence Lawrence, Mack Sennett, Flora Finch	N/A	6.0	7	N/A	After overhearing Jones mocking her, the lady book agent slips a suggestive note into Jones's pocket. A jealous Mrs. Jones finds the note, and a huge quarrel erupts.	There is no question that the good natured man is always made the "Patsy," and so it is that poor Jones, who is benignity personified, is always getting into hot water. His latest episode is an experience with a female book agent, who tried to sell him a book entitled. "How to Be Happy, Tho' Wedded." The work does not appeal to affable Edward, and he with gentlemanly firmness ejects her from his office, as his friend Dick Smith enters, to whom he mimics the ludicrous antics of his visitor. All this is witnessed by this modern Clio, who is peeking through the keyhole. She vows to be revenged, and seeing a box of gloves which Jones has bought for his wife, she substitutes her corsets for the gloves, writes a note which she puts in his overcoat pocket, asking him to return her corsets, and finally sends a letter to Mrs. Jones warning her of her husband's perfidy and to search his pockets for proof. Does the scheme work? Well there seems to a certainty a case of "Jones vs. Jones" appearing on the calendar of the divorce court in the near future, but the book agent becomes conscience stricken and sends a letter of contrition to Mr. and Mrs. Jones, explaining everything. Peace again reigns and Jones receives the osculatory balm on his throbbing forehead.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:00.067000000

Well, here we pay another visit to the Jones' domicile, with the same amusing results, for Jones cannot help being funny, and we feel sure that his obituary, not that we are in a hurry to write it, will read like "Pickings from Puck." Mr. and Mrs. J. seem to be in for a dull evening, when the amateur dramatic club is announced, and then the fun begins. Jones had never been considered even a "near-actor," but when he is selected to play the lover to Mrs. Trouble he is a brilliant success: so much so that Mrs. Jones insists upon playing the part. With this change, Jones' histrionic ability deserts him, and he is a "frost." Well, things move along at a pretty rapid pace with the party, until Jones, in a jealous rage, ejects the bunch. The film is really one of the funniest of the Jones series.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-07 01:30:06.390000000

Jim Flanders, a wealthy ranchman, has a beautiful daughter, Alice, who is loved by Tom Ripley, the foreman of the ranch. The match is objected to by Flanders, who desires his daughter to wed a more cultured and refined man. Ripley is so persistent, however, that Flanders discharges him from his services and orders him to leave the ranch. Robert Gray, an Easterner, and the type of a man, presumably, that Flanders prefers for a son-in-law, is sojourning at the ranch and appears to be desperately in love with Alice. Alice, however, sees through the veneer and Eastern polish of his makeup, and will have nothing to do with him. A climax comes one day shortly after when Ripley again visits the girl and is ordered away by Flanders. A bitter quarrel ensues in which Ripley draws his gun, but he is saved from shooting the ranchman by the timely interference of the other cowboys. Ripley leaves quietly but makes threats which Flanders and a number of cowboys overhear. In a quarrel with one of his employees, Pete, a half-breed, Flanders is shot in the back and Gray, arriving on the scene threatens to expose the Mexican, unless he complies to a certain plan, by which he thinks he can dispose of Ripley and win Alice. The revolver which the half-breed used in shooting his employer is slipped into Ripley's holster and his own removed therefrom. Then an alarm is turned in and a few minutes later Ripley is dragged from his shack and accused of the murder. Evidence is only too strong and speedy Western justice is soon served. Ripley is lynched and Gray finds an open road to the girl's hand. There is a stronger law sometimes than that which is meted out by human hands. "Remorse," that haunting, phantom thing that drives the criminal inevitably to his death, no matter how innocent he may appear in the eyes of the world. Gray wins Alice's consent to marry him, but as he slips on the engagement ring the girl's form melts and in his deluded mind he imagines Ripley is standing in front of him, an accusing finger pointed at him. Gray, uttering a shriek, staggers back, and flees, leaving the astonished girl staring after him. He seeks the solitude of the wilds of a rocky canyon, but the form of Ripley continues to haunt him. A circling eagle high up on the cliff, screams mockingly at him, while the roaring mountain torrent hurls accusations at him. He wends his way with difficulty up the face of the cliff and drops in a heap on the top. Pete, the half-breed, finds him there an hour later. Gray rises and grapples with him. The astonished half-breed struggles, but the superhuman strength of the deluded man crushes all resistance, and a moment later the two totter over the brink to their death on the rocks a thousand feet below. The picture ends here. Judgment, swift and sure, meted out by the hand of unrelenting fate, has balanced the debt.	N/A	USA	N/A	2015-02-26 00:44:20.507000000

Prizes gained without effort are never valuable, and, though we don't appreciate it, the longing for something makes existence sweet; hence if one has everything there is nothing to long for. Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen. He on the other hand, not knowing of course her true self, falls in love with her. All this is most agreeable to the women folks, who at once conspire to rid the place of her, which one brings about by having her accused of the theft of the musician's violin. He, of course, believes her innocent, but she is discharged nevertheless. Lady Helen is so moved by the poor fellow's kindness, that she interests herself in his behalf and secures for him a position as a director at the Conservatory, for which he calls to thank her and finding her a lady of quality would shrink humbly from her presence, but she will not let him for she too loves him. The subject as a whole is a decidedly amusing comedy drama, with a pretty love story running through it.	English	USA	1 win.	2014-10-14 00:08:03.257000000

He finds himself once again very jealous of the late Lucky Jim.	Jim and Jack were desperately in love with Gertrude, but Gertie showed a decided preference for Jim, so Jim wins out and marries Gertie; lucky Jim! Poor Jack is a miserable spectator at the wedding. Jim and his bride have ensconced in their little flat, and are enjoying their first meal. Sad to say, Gertie's education in the art of cooking has been woefully neglected and the result of her first attempt is simply awful. It is so bad that Jim kicks, and in return for his vehement vituperation he receives the little delicate attentions that Xanthippe bestowed upon Socrates. Numerous articles of tableware at his head, sweet-tempered Gertie, lucky Jim. Meanwhile unlucky Jack is at home repining before a portrait of Gertie. Time goes on and poor Jack is still repining, when a notice in the newspaper is shown him which chronicles the intelligence that Jim has shuffled, a victim of acute indigestion, and his head is now adorned with a halo instead of the rim of a dishpan. Jack feels that here is his chance, and Gertie is more interesting than before from the fact of being a widow, so he makes his appeal and is accepted. Jack is in the seventh heaven of delight when he returns with the sweet angel Gertie from the marriage ceremony. But wait: that first meal is to transpire. Well, it comes in due time, and Jack gets a chance to sample a bit of Gertrude's cooking, and if the road to the heart is through the stomach in Jack's case the roadbed is pretty rocky. He positively refuses to drink her coffee, and. of course, his repellency meets with the same reward meted Jim, to wit: china tableware bounced from his cerebrum shell. Gertie, having demonstrated her ability as a discobolus thrower, leaves the room in a rage. Jack turns and seeing the mourning-draped picture of his predecessor, sighs, "Oh, lucky Jim, how I envy him."	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-24 01:00:00.330000000

Hence it is when Isabelle appears on the scene clad in a gown that is a masterpiece of the dressmaker's art she easily fascinates the male contingent, among whom is Enrico, the sweetheart of Veronica, a street singer. Enrico is so enraptured at the sight of Isabelle in her resplendent attire that he becomes her abject slave, casting aside the poor, peasant-clad little Italian street singer, who has loved him devotedly. Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lever left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown. The lady is moved to commiseration and offers her aid in the gift of the most beautiful gown Veronica has ever seen. Her opportunity for revenge has turned her love to hate, and as she appears at the Italian Benevolent Association ball, she is the star of the event, for she looks like a queen as she promenades the ball room. She at once becomes the "Mrs. Trouble" of the evening, for the men all desert their partners and flock around her, beseeching but a smile. All this elicits from the women folk delicate little bon-mots such as "Hussy." "Temptress." "Cat," "False hair." "Paints." Oh, well, you know how it is. Enrico is thrown into a rage that runs the entire gamut of emotions, love, jealousy, hate, disappointment and a few others, too numerous to mention here. He begs forgiveness, declaring undying love, but she tells him it is the gown that has attracted him and not her, but on his knees he swears. Still she will not trust him and turns to a poor good-hearted Italian who has persistently loved her despite her coldness.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:08.880000000

They predict the kingship of Macbeth with the words, "All Hail, King, that shall be hereafter." They show him a crown, and having also predicted that he shall be created Thane of Cawdor, and that the sons of Banquo shall be Kings of Scotland and not those of Macbeth, the witches fade away, to the utter dismay of the two generals. Then follows a series of very fine tableaux, showing King Duncan conferring upon Macbeth the dignity of Thane of Cawdor, thus verifying the prophesy of the witches, the evil council of Lady Macbeth and the visit of King Duncan to Macbeth's castle, accompanied by his two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, with a numerous retinue. The King is received with gracious smiles by Lady Macbeth, who is still urging her husband to kill him so that they may both attain to royal state. Macbeth's honorable aversion to so foul a deed, and the constant promptings of the wicked Lady Macbeth, are finely portrayed. The murder of the King is finally accomplished by Macbeth, and Lady Macbeth is seen to place the blood-stained dagger in the belt of one of the royal attendants, to divert suspicion. Macbeth is crowned King. The assassination of Banquo follows, and his ghost is seen to appear to Macbeth at the great feast. Macbeth's second consultation with the witches in their cave is shown, and he is told to beware of Macduff, the Thane of Fife, and that he should never be vanquished until the wood of Birnam should move.

At the party, Mrs. Ross realizes she left the wrong medicine, and desperately tries to contact her daughter before it's too late.	This film demonstrates two things, the efficacy of that time-saving agent which out Mercurys Mercury, the telephone, and the importance of that movement to enforce a differential form of bottle in which to hold poisonous liquids. Mrs. Ross, whose mother is very ill, has in attendance a trained nurse, who has received an urgent message to come to her own home, owing to the illness of her sister. As Mrs. Ross is dressed and ready to attend an afternoon tea at Mrs. Parker's, this forced absence of the nurse is very inopportune. However, little Alice. Mrs. Ross's seven-year-old daughter, is a bright child, so she feels that she can trust her to look after her grandma, and give her the medicine at the regular intervals. Mrs. Ross, herself, is suffering from a painful abrasion on her hand, for which she has procured an antiseptic to bathe it with, which is a deadly poison. It happens that the antiseptic and grandma's medicine are contained in similar-shaped bottles, and Mrs. Ross in her hurry and excitement takes away the wrong bottle. While at Mrs. Parker's, the hostess cuts her finger with a paper knife and Mrs. Ross offers her the antiseptic to bathe it. When she discovers she has carried away the medicine, leaving the poison for the child to give grandma. Looking at the clock, she finds it is on the hour of the administering of the dose. The poor woman is beside herself in fearful helplessness, when Mrs. Parker suggests the telephone. This she tries, and she is put in further trepidation at her inability to get connection, for at Central the operators are too busy chatting to take notice. She at length gets her home and is relieved to learn from the child that grandma has not been given the poison, owing to the fact that baby had spilt the first spoonful she poured out.

When the lover is about to kill his rival, she convinces him it was all a joke and the two reconcile.	The experience of Tantalus was never so chafing as a tantalizing sweetheart. The strength of this is better understood when we realize the impetuous nature of the Latin type of person. The Senorita, to tease her sweetheart, pretends love for an American soldier, and for a while it looks as if the little detachment of soldiers would be forced to bestow the last military honors on one of their number. However, by a clever trick, Senorita rights the impending wrong; the soldier escapes without a scar, and the sweethearts are left enjoying their cigarettes. This subject, while being short, is one of the most beautiful pieces of high-class acting ever attempted, the leading character being played by a native Spaniard.

They give chase, forcing the burglar to return to the fire-escape for an exit. Being closely pursued, the thief is compelled to enter the next window below, arousing the tenant in his hasty endeavor to get away. The pursuers are joined by the person disturbed, and the culprit is again forced to make the fire-escape. In and out the windows, on and off the fire-escape, the unfortunate burglar is pursued by the ever-increasing mob, through the hallways, knocking everyone down that comes between him and his freedom. At last his Nemesis appears in the shape of a bulldog, who follows him with a persistency that brings about his capture. A German policeman figures prominently in the picture, also a gentleman about to take a bath. The following crowd is dressed in a variety of costumes that adds greatly to the comical events.

Meanwhile, tradesmen rehearse a play. All of them suffer from the shenanigans of mischievous fairies.	Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is engaged to be married to Hippolyta. One of the Duke's courtiers has a daughter, Hermia, who, for business reasons, he decides shall marry Demetrius: but she is in love with Lysander. Her father appeals to the Duke and he decrees that Hermia must obey her father or forever remain unmarried. The lovers decide to elope and they are followed by the rejected suitor, Demetrius, and Helena, who loves him in vain. On the night of the elopement a number of townspeople are rehearsing in the woods a play which they intend to present at the wedding of Duke Theseus. The eloping lovers, followed by Demetrius and Helena, wander to the same part of the forest that the players frequent. Meanwhile among the fairies of the forest a little love episode has ended in a tiff and Oberon, the king of the fairies, sends his messenger, Puck, for an herb, which, when placed upon the eyes of a sleeper, will cause him or her to love the first creature seen upon awakening. The eloping lovers. Lysander and Hermia, overcome by fatigue, have lain down to sleep, as also have Demetrius and Helena. Puck, a mischievous sprite, touches the eyes of Lysander with the magic herb and he first sees Helena when he awakes and immediately falls in love with her. Demetrius, who has also felt the magic spell, awakes and also first sees Helena and loves her. Helena now has two lovers and Hermia, who formerly had two, new has none. The two men quarrel over Helena. Puck has also come across the tradesmen rehearsing their play, and because Bottom, a weaver, insists that he can act a part, Puck changes his head into that of an ass. Titania, the Queen of the fairies, awakes and discovering Bottom, the ass, falls in love with him. Oberon, the king of the fairies, discovering the mischief that has been done by his messenger, orders Puck to keep the quarreling lovers apart until the ravel is untangled. He restores Bottom to his normal shape and Titania to her normal senses. Lysander's love for Hermia is restored, while Demetrius is allowed to remain in love with Helena. The Duke and his retinue, coming through the forest on a hunting expedition in the morning, find the four lovers happily paired off and the next day there are three weddings instead of one and the tradespeople give their play in honor of the occasion.

In this the story is followed from the love of Marius and Cosette to the death of Jean, which ends the volume. M. Marius, grandson of M. Gillenormand, sees Cosette, Jean Valjean's foster-daughter, now grown into a beautiful girl, in the Luxembourg, and falls madly in love with her. Valjean, apprised of the love affair, refuses to give his consent, and Marius induces Cosette to marry him without parental sanction. Meanwhile Thenardier, once the keeper of the Inn of the Soldier of Waterloo at Montfermeil, but now reduced to dire straits in Paris, recognizes in a benevolent old man the visitor to the inn who removed the child Cosette and who must be the escaped convict, Jean Valjean. Playing upon his sympathy, Thenardier induces Jean to visit his apartment, and Marius, who occupies the next room because a quarrel with his grandfather has reduced him to want, overhears a part of the plot and rescues Jean by warning the police. Jean makes his escape and next encounters Marius at the barricade, where he releases Javert, the human bloodhound, who, through a score of years, has remorselessly hunted Jean. Gavriche, the gamin, is there, enjoying the battle until his brave sortie to rifle the cartouche boxes of the dead soldiers brings to an end his gay life and finds for him a place beside his dead sister, Eponine, whose love for Marius has led her to assume a boy's dress and follow him to the barricade. Jean learns of Marius's relations with Cosette and when the regulars carry the barricade he makes his escape into the sewer with the unconscious man upon his back. In the sewer he encounters Thenardier, who permits him to escape from the locked gate by means of a false key, at the same time cutting from Marius's trousers a portion of one leg as a means of identification. Later Thenardier's attempt to blackmail Marius clears away the cloud of suspicion that has hovered over Jean in Marius's mind, and he and Cosette hurry to Jean, whom they find dying of starvation and heartbreak, but happy at the sight of Cosette once more. The story has been slightly altered to give greater dramatic value to the scenes and clarity to the narrative, and the result is a release in keeping with the earlier sections of the same story, though, like the others, this story is in itself an interesting tale apart from the earlier releases.

But Oh! the ordeal, for such it was, was telling on him, and his pent-up spirits were threatening ebullition, when at last the chance comes. The league arranges to attend a three-days' convention out of town, and when Mrs. Jones departs, Jones sends a note to Smith, telling him to bring the gang, and they would have a "Prayer Meeting," enjoining him not to forget the "fixings." Well, the gang are not long in putting in an appearance, for they feel that every minute's delay is a chunk lost from a golden opportunity for fun. Of "fixing" there is much, and it isn't long before they are in the "Wild Indian" stage of inebriety. During this time the feminine nemesis of Rum, the League has arrived at the station just in time to see the train pull out. Madder than wet hens, they decide to pass the night with Mrs. Jones. "Oh, horror! Oh horror! a couple of times." Does not your sympathetic heart go out to poor unsuspecting Jones who in the meantime has gotten into a glorious condition, and the gang dress him in one of his wife's gowns, paint his face, carry him to the bedroom and throw him into bed, covering him up with the bedclothes. At this moment the prohibition party are seen approaching the house. The men hide as best they can the "fixings," and are sitting reading books entitled "Down with Rum" when the ladies enter. They of course are delighted at this sight, and the absence of Jones is explained by a faked note calling him to attend a sick friend, noble Jones. The ladies go to the bedroom to remove their wraps, and their intrusion arouses Jones, who, not recognizing them, makes a dash for them, at which they all rush wildly into the drawing room, screaming that there is a madman in the bedroom. The men then rush in and while pretending to annihilate the imagined maniac they tidy up Jones and slip him through the window, that he may go around and enter the front door. The fright attending this episode has somewhat sobered him and everything would have been well had not Mrs. J. got a whiff of his breath. Even this would have passed, but Sister Anderson spies the bottles. Well, it's all off. It looks bad for Jones until the gang step forward and claim all the blame, as Jones was not even present. Here Jones makes the bluff and exclaims majestically. "Madam, nimium de crede colori!" or, in other words, "Trust not to appearances." and the bluff goes.

As a result, she is dismissed from her job, but her employer finds her so attractive that he suggests a new job for her, as his wife.	The pretty little romance which forms the plot of this subject shows one of the subtle ways Cupid has in bringing about the affined condition in two hearts entirely unlooked for. Ella Berlins is engaged as a shoe packer at the Lone Star Shoe Factory, and by way of a lark, and egged on by her companions, writes a note of usual type and places it in the lining of a shoe. The shoe is one of a consignment to a retailer, and falls into the hands of one of his best customers, although an awful grouch. In a fury he returns the shoes with what he considers an insulting note, and declares he will buy his shoes elsewhere in the future. The dealer is at first inclined to feel amused over the incident, but when he realizes the loss be suffers, he at once writes of the affair to the manufacturer. The result is that Ella is called before the proprietor and fired. However, her sweet, innocent face makes such an impression on the proprietor that he reconsiders her dismissal and she returns to work. He now sees her often as she busies herself among the others packing shoes, and the more he sees her the more impressed he becomes, until at length, well, she is simply out of place as far as he is concerned, and with some trumped up offense she is fired again. Sorrowfully she goes home and to her mother's query as to why she was discharged she has no answer for she does not know. She can simply sigh forth the time-worn expression, "1 didn't do anything." While they are sorrowing there is a knock, and mother answers, opening the door to the boss. He enters sternly and starts in to scold Ella unsparingly, finishing by saying that as a shoe packer she is an awful failure, but as his wife she, he knew, would be the greatest kind of success.

Both father's and mother's whole life is centered in their little one, and the little family are as happy as can be until death tears the baby from them. As the child's soul leaves its body, so the poor heart-broken mother's reason leaves her. What an awful blow to Murray. The loss of his child was indeed hard to bear, but his dear wife hurled into a living death was worse. A trained nurse must be her constant companion, and the poor woman spent her time fondling the dolls and playthings of her lost one. Murray's beat lay in the tenderloin section of the city, and many curious characters came under his notice. In the cellar under a junk shop there lived, or rather existed, a Sicilian couple of the very lowest type, who eked an existence by begging and theft. A little orphan girl fell into their keeping and they forced her to beg on the street for them, beating her into submission if she refused, which the child's proud spirit inclined her to do. Out in the snow storm, thinly clad, the poor child was made to stand at the stage doors of the theaters or in front of saloons to work upon the sympathy of the generous-hearted habitués. She was always accompanied by the Sicilian woman, who took good care that she didn't escape. Murray, on his rounds, runs into them and his suspicions are aroused, so he follows them and enters their hovel just in time to see the poor creature receiving a frightful beating. With a terrific blow he sends the man reeling to the floor and hurling the woman on top of him he seizes the child in his arms. At this moment a couple of his squad, in answer to his whistle, enter and take the Sicilians in charge. An idea dawns on him. He takes the little one home and presents her to his poor demented wife. The presence of the child at once restores her reason, so the clouds of sorrow are dissipated and happiness reigns. The picture presents a moral showing the singular working of God's justice in taking to Himself an unsullied soul that another might be saved.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:19.380000000

This is a creation of headgear that for size outstrips anything yet designed by the disordered mind of the modiste. As a "skypiece" it is a "skyscraper," and in decoration it looks like a combination horticultural and food exhibition. Nevertheless, this mammoth "lid" was seized onto by the feminine world with the avidity of a boy for his first baseball suit. It is only natural that our friend, Mrs. Jones, should experience this obsession, and what woe it preambled! The Jones family are seated at breakfast. Mr. Jones is reading the morning paper. An account of a kidnapping by gypsies engages his attention, and he is filled with horror at the anticipation of the possible abduction of his young hopeful, a baby one year old. He tries to impress Mrs. J., but she is fascinated by the millinery "ads." The situation for Jones becomes more tense when on going outside he sees a couple of the odious gypsies with a child. Mrs. Jones takes herself off to buy a peachbasket, leaving baby in charge of the nurse, who, being of a romantic nature, enlists the services of the gypsies to tell her fortune. Mrs. Jones returns and almost catches the nursemaid, who is quite beside herself at her near discovery. Mrs. Jones places the huge box containing the hat on the table, while the nurse, placing the baby on the floor, assists in extricating the hat from its crate. Putting on the hat, Mrs. J. goes into the next room, followed by the maid, to view the effect in the mirror. .Mr. Jones now arrives, and his first thought is for baby; he cares naught for the peachbasket hat. Baby is nowhere to be seen. The nurse, in her excitement, does not remember where she placed it. Through the house they rush fruitlessly; out on the road and on after the disappearing gypsies, who are overtaken only to find that the baby the woman carries is not a Jones. The clouds of despair o'ershadow the couple in their dining-room, when suddenly the hat box on the floor is seen to move. There, under the hollow cube of pasteboard, is found baby Jones, the box having been blown by a gust of wind off the table over the child.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:55.473000000

Unknown to her, the music has a healing effect on all who hear her as she passes by.	Our story opens with Pippa awakening in her little room with the morning's light pouring through the window, for the "day's at the morn; morning's at seven; the hillside's dew-pearled; the lark's on the wing; the snail's on the thorn; God's in His heaven. All's right with the world." To-day is a holiday in Asolo, the whir of the spindles of the silk mill is silenced and Pippa, the little silk winder, saunters forth with her lute to brighten life's ordeal with song, little realizing what good she is doing. Her song of peace, "God's in His heaven. All's right with the world!" induces faith, hope and charity, faith in God's justice, hope for our welfare, and charity towards mankind. The workman goes to spend his time and earnings at the tavern, neglecting his despairing wife, with their little child, who grieve at home. In the midst of the roistering, Pippa passes, singing her song of peace. The words sink deep into the heart of the workman, and force him to return to his sorrowing wife, with a resolve never to err more. The next episode is that of the marrying of Jules to the Greek model, whom he believes an innocent young girl. Upon learning her true character, Jules would have struck her down, but at that moment Pippa passes, and her song induces him to be charitable and he resolves to save and protect her. Wending her way through the lanes, Pippa approaches the shrub house of Luca, wherein a terrible tragedy is impending. Luca sleeps and his wife, Ottima, is persuading her lover, Sibald, to dispatch him. With upraised dagger, he approaches the couch, and the dagger is about to fall, when Pippa's song is heard. What a transformation. Conscience turns their eyes into their very souls and how black the aspect, "God's in His heaven. All's right with the world!" Are we not of the world? How stand we in the sight of God? What ministering angel art thou, who with song has stayed the hand that would have done irreparable wrong?" Thus has Pippa's song averted a tragedy, Returning to her little room, she retires. "Day's turn is over, now arrives the night's." The golden sunshine fades into silver moonbeams and Pippa sleeps, innocent of the good her peregrinations hare worked.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-13 00:37:24.970000000

One day Tom wandered near the palace gates. Too near, thought the guard on duty, for he cuffed him away, and Tom cried aloud under the sting of his blows. Edward the prince, was in the palace grounds near the gate, and, hearing the outcries, made inquiry as to the cause. A courtier brought the answer. Edward had a gentle heart. There was misery in the cries of the lad outside. He ordered him brought within to console him. The prince's word was law. The pauper boy was brought before him. Never having conversed with a boy of the streets before, Edward retired with him to a secluded room and there both noticed the resemblance between them through an accidental joint glance in a mirror. The prince suggested the boyish prank that they change clothes tor the moment. No sooner said than done. Tom pranced about in the prince's royal raiment and truly royal he looked, while the prince masqueraded as the pauper boy and looked Tom Canty to the life. At this moment Tom spoke of the unnecessary brutality of the guard. In a flash, forgetting his attire, the prince was off to chastise the guard. Alone and with one whom he thought the pauper boy, the guard was not gentle. He pitched the prince in beggar's rags into the street. Wildly the prince proclaimed himself, but a jeering crowd drove him away. Before he could return he encountered the elder Canty and was hauled off, despite his protests, to their hovel. Here he was beaten because he had begged no money, and later was dragged off to join a band of roving rogues. From these he was rescued by a poor knight, Miles Herndon, and the two became fast friends, though the knight laughed at the supposed beggar's pretensions to royalty. Meanwhile Tom had been having many strange adventures at the palace, where he was supposed to be the prince. His singular conduct caused an impression among the couriers that he was demented. King Henry VIII, Edward's father, died at this juncture, and here truly was a fateful circumstance; for the pauper hoy was hailed king of England, and, though in agony of mind over it, was about to be crowned. The ceremony was in actual occurrence in Westminster Abbey when the prince succeeded in gaining admittance. Loudly he proclaimed himself and would have been struck down by the soldiery as a traitor had it not been for Tom himself. He was the first to acknowledge his rightful king, and it was through his aid that Edward was enabled to step to the throne and receive the crown that in a few moments more would have been placed on the pauper boy's head.

One of her other suitors, a French officer, discovers the hiding place and threatens to kill the spy.	A dramatic episode during the Franco-Prussian war. Lady Florence is enamored of a young Prussian soldier. Count Lopes, an officer in the French army, also loves her, but is rejected. He suspects she loves another, and watches to find out who his rival may be. A Prussian spy has been tracked to the mansion, and the Count has reason to believe that he is the favored one, as he sees him enter her window. Following, the Prussian is hidden by Lady Florence in a closet, when the Count enters. He accuses her; she denies even on oath; but the Count detects her anxious look toward the closet. Considering it undignified to search, he plans a more subtle means. Calling two of his lieutenants, he pretends to test a new revolver, using a panel of the closet as a target, still giving her Ladyship a chance to present her lover; but she is obdurate and denies his accusation. Her Ladyship dispatches her maid to the upper floor to remove the trap door above the closet, but too late, for the shots are fired, and when the closet door is opened the sad truth is revealed. This is a subject most beautifully staged and acted with convincing discretion, as well as photographically perfect.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:10.600000000

The subject opens with the return home of Prince Dimitri, who meets the maid Katusha, a little peasant girl, and is instantly charmed with her beauty. Young, artless and innocent, as pretty as a rose, she unwittingly fascinates the prince. His noble bearing likewise impresses her, and his little attentions flatter her, until at length she is unable to resist his advances. The poor girl is meted the usual fate. An alliance is out of the question. The disparity of their ranks even forbids it, and soon the prince must cast her aside. Five years later we find that the girl, who is now a loathsome sight, has learned the bitter lesson of the eternal truth, "The wages of sin is death." It is death to the soul at all events. She has gone down to the lowest depths and is arrested in a low Russian tavern. As she is carried to the tribunal she passes Prince Dimitri, who now sees the terrible result of his sins. He grows repentant and attempts to plead her cause before the jury, but they are a callous lot and pay no attention to the arguments for nor against, and by force of habit vote to send her to Siberia. She is dragged out to the pen of detention and herded with a lot of poor unfortunates, who scarcely bear any resemblance to human beings. The repentant prince determines to give up his life to right the wrong he has done, and visits her here with a view of turning her now vicious nature, handing her a copy of the Bible. She does not recognize him at first, but when she does she flies into fury, beating his body and face with her fists and the book. He leaves her and she sits moodily on the bench with the book on her lap. Shortly she turns its pages and lo, the Resurrection! Her eyes fall on the passage (John xi, 25), "And Jesus said unto her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live." In an instant her whole being changes. There is hope for her salvation, and she reads on. The guards arrive and we next see her with the poor unfortunates trudging over the snow-clad steppes toward the goal from whence few return. She becomes the ministering angel, sharing her comforts with them. The prince, meanwhile, has secured her pardon and hastens after her. Giving her the welcome notice, he begs her to return with him as his wife: but no, she prefers to work out her salvation helping those poor souls to whom a kindness is an indescribable blessing, and bidding him farewell, she renounces the world for the path of duty, so we leave her kneeling on the snow at the foot of the Holy Cross.

Julie, the beautiful ward of Cardinal Richelieu, enters, and Baradas attempts to show his regard for her. Chevalier DeMauprat also enters and greets Julie, and the two men exchange jealous glances. The Cardinal is announced and all fall back while he affectionately greets Julie. The plotters show their hate of the Cardinal behind his back, but quail under his searching glances. The Cardinal passes on, and DeMauprat is seen to make love to Julie. This is discovered by the Cardinal, who has DeMauprat seized and accuses him of conspiracy, and, while pretending to send him to his doom, in reality ushers him into the room where Julie is waiting, and gives his consent to the marriage, thereby winning DeMauprat's devotion. Shortly after the wedding Julie is separated from her husband and imprisoned in the palace of King Louis XIII on the pretext that the marriage had been without his consent. In reality the King is infatuated with Julie, and he is aided in the abduction by the jealous Baradas, who informs DeMauprat that it is Richelieu that is responsible for the loss of his bride. DeMauprat swears to kill Richelieu, and that is just what the arch-traitor and conspirator Baradas desires. Julie, a prisoner in the royal palace, is terrified as the King enters and makes love to her, but the Queen enters and the King, repulsed slinks away. The Queen aids Julie to escape and she reaches the Cardinal's apartments at midnight and tells him what has occurred. He secretes her in an inner room, and knocks are heard at the door. Opening the door he confronts DeMauprat, who is masked, and who calmly informs the Cardinal that he has come to kill him. The Cardinal defies him and dares him to reveal his identity. DeMauprat unmasks. Richelieu orders him to his knees to ask pardon, as he calls Julie from the adjoining room, who flies to the arms of her husband. DeMauprat, seeing that he has been deceived by Baradas, determines to save the life of the Cardinal, and draws his sword to defend him from the other masked conspirators who are clamoring for entrance. Richelieu suggests a ruse, and. sending Julie out of the room, lies down on the bed and feigns death, while DeMauprat admits the conspirators, and, pointing to the outstretched form, explains that he strangled the Cardinal. Baradas and DeMauprat meet and fight. DeMauprat is arrested by order of the King. Consternation reigns as the supposed dead Cardinal appears and denounces Baradas to the King. Baradas whispers something in the King's ear, and he orders DeMauprat a prisoner and sends a letter to Julie demanding her presence at court. The King's messenger is defied by Richelieu. The final scene of this dramatic series of events shows the King on his throne, surrounded by Baradas and other courtiers, who are really aspiring to dethrone the King. Julie enters and pleads for the life of her husband. The King refuses and says that DeMauprat must die. Here the Cardinal totters in, seemingly very weak, hands a paper to a page, which is given to the King to read. Louis starts, as it unmasks Baradas as the arch conspirator who had been in secret connivance with the King's enemies. Louis orders the arrest of Baradas and the Cardinal, throwing off his simulated weakness, triumphs over all his enemies. DeMauprat is released and he and Julie embrace and kneel to the King and to the great Cardinal, who blesses them.	N/A	USA	N/A	2015-03-01 01:55:24.617000000

Two out-laws, one an Englishman, the other a Mexican (both well known for their daring robberies and their phenomenal success in eluding the sheriffs and their deputies) plan to rob a certain stage supposed to contain valuables and money amounting to a considerable fortune, The method always pursued by the Englishman in his nefarious work was to become acquainted with travelers, and ascertain the amount of valuables they carried. The opening, scene shows the Englishman mixing with the travelers as they are boarding the stage coach, wishing them a pleasant journey and making his adieux; then the stage driving away. The bandit then meets his confederate, the Mexican, and they mount their horses, and together they take a short cut and head off the unsuspecting travelers. After relieving the occupants of the coach of their valuables, the bandits remount their horses and escape. A messenger is at once dispatched to the nearest town, and the sheriff notified of the robbery. The latter mounts his horse, rounds up his deputies, "swears in" a number of cowboys and starts in pursuit of the daring duo. In the meantime the two bandits return to the home of the Mexican and divide their ill-gotten gains. During the division a quarrel ensues, owing to the Englishman claiming the larger part of the spoils. The Mexican draws his knife, but his companion is too quick for him, and after forcing the Mexican to drop his weapon, picks up the most valuable articles and departs. Stung by the humiliation and enraged by the unfair treatment of his companion, the Mexican follows, bent on vengeance, but too cowardly to attack his late comrade openly. He springs upon him as he is changing his clothing and after a severe struggle fatally wounds the Englishman, robs him and escapes. The man revives; struggles to his feet; staggers to the road and intercepts the sheriff and his posse. Acknowledging his guilt he names his confederate and falls dead at the feet of the sheriff. Remounting his horse, the sheriff and posse start in hot pursuit of the surviving bandit. The Mexican espies the posse from afar, and securing his mount leads his pursuers a most exciting chase over mountains, through trackless deserts, bristling with cacti and sage brush, and after a running pistol duel is finally lassoed from his horse and brought to justice.

This sends Miguel into a fury, but still obdurate, he allows them to go, saying that he can get along without them. Now comes the crucial condition.

Miguel makes his way disconsolately and sheepishly to his daughter's and son-in-law's cabin, where he finds them seated enjoying a peaceful repast. The savory aroma from the well-cooked viands is too alluring and he at once relents for the sake of a hearty meal.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:05.583000000

Flamant, a typical roué of the French nobility, is surrounded by all the pleasures and pastimes his fabulous wealth can procure, but still at times he suffers extreme weariness and disgust for the toadying sycophants about him, so in quest of diversion he visits the art rooms, just as a young girl enters with a magnificent piece of sculpture and places it on sale. The roué is so impressed with the work and the girl that he purchases it at once and follows her to the atelier, where he learns that she is the maid of the sculptress, whom he sees and at once falls passionately in love with her as only a man of his type can, but when he learns that she is totally blind, his feelings change to one of deepest pity, which is, we know, the kindling of pure love. He arranges with her to sit for a bust of himself and when it is finished he declares his love for her but she realizes her condition and rejects it, although she has by intuition come to love him deeply. As he leaves the studio crestfallen she sinks down and for the first time feels the enormity of her affliction, sobbing she cries: "Oh! God, how I love him, and yet it must not be." A little child model, who is employed by the sculptress, hears this and trips from the place and makes her way to the roué's palace, where she tells him the empyrean truth. Taking up the little one in his arms he rushes back to the studio to set aside the sculptress' compunction and claim her as his own.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:09.147000000

It happened thus: Mrs. Leffingwell has been favored with a visit by some friends in the early evening, and they departing, one of the ladies forgot her muff. Mrs. Leffingwell runs after her with the pulse warmer, overtaking her at the street door. Their second meeting conjures up renewed thoughts of gossip and they spend quite a time, for these are woman's happiest moments, in ibis regalement. In the interim a gentleman burglar enters the apartment and, thinking the coast clear, starts in to work at once. He, by skillful manipulation, manages to open a small safe in which .Mrs. Leffingwell keeps her money and jewels. He has scarcely procured the booty when the approach of someone startles him. Finding there is no means of escape, he puts the loot in his pocket and determines to brave the situation by subterfuge. To this end he reclines in an easy chair and feigns sleep. Mrs. Leffingwell is startled on her entrance at seeing this stranger, who appears to be the same when he sees her, pretending to have gotten into the wrong apartment. She is about to let him depart, when she discovers the safe open, and so, by enticing glances and invitations, induces him to remain. She then engages his attention while she slyly pulls the bellcord which brings her butler, whom she dispatches for the police, and when our gentleman friend is confident he has made a tremendous hit with his hostess two stalwart policemen enter and take him into custody, restoring, after a search, her money and valuables.

Although of a romantic turn, they have not selected Spring as the season to enact the episode, the weather being decidedly hibernal, and so Hank arrives clothed in a heavy hat and long ulster. Hungry Henry, the hobo, butts in on the scene at this moment, and from a distance casts covetous glances at the aforesaid ulster, and when Hank goes to procure a ladder he follows and with one fell swoop knocks out Hank, taking his ulster and hat, leaving him bound and gagged. Back he goes to complete the romance, which had begun so beautifully that it would be a shame not to consummate. Wrapped up in the ulster, with hat pulled over his face, the hobo might easily be taken for Hank by one less nervous than Cynthia, so she descends the ladder and makes off. They haven't gone far when she discovers her error, but the tramp drags her along by force. Meanwhile, poor Hank, reviving from the effects of the blow, rolls over and over until he reaches Stebbins' porch steps. Disarranging the gag he calls and brings to his aid Dad Stebbins and the rest of the household, who, after a hurried explanation from Hank, start after the human gorilla in whose clutches they realize poor Cynthia must be. After a spirited chase, serious in agonizing earnestness, and comical in ruralistic details, they come up with the miscreant, and the poor trembling Cynthia is handed over to her dad, who in turn hands her to the brave hero Hank, at which there is general rejoicing.

Mary Wilson, a neglected child of the slums, falls in with Bob Walton, a tough denizen of the lower east side, and loves him with a pure, honest affection that his low nature cannot appreciate. He forces her to enter a saloon where she is insulted by Harry Brown, which is resented by Bob. They quarrel, come to blows, and Brown draws a gun as Bob closes in on him, forcing the muzzle against Brown's breast as it explodes, thereby causing him to shoot himself, dying almost instantly. But Walton is arrested and sentenced to one year in Sing Sing. The morning papers appear with an account of the affair and as Mary's name is put into prominence in the account she is grievously hounded by misfortune, evicted from her boarding place and also discharged from the factory where she works, she falls into the hands of a professional woman shoplifter, who is anxious to enlist her services as an accomplice. The girl soon discovers the character of her would-be benefactor, and rushes from the place, running into the arms of the Salvation Army, which offers her peace and rest. Taking her to the barracks she is enrolled a soldier, and one soul is lifted from the darkness into the light. With the Army, Mary has won the affection of all for her humility and goodness. Working as she does, in the slums a year later she comes face to face with Bob, who has just been released from prison, having served his time. He is on the point of becoming a party to a burglary, but she prevents, even with almost fatal results for herself. But she will not give him up, and after a series of touching episodes finally moves him to appreciate the strength of that holy invitation "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give thee rest." so in the final scene we see Bob kneel in devout humility to receive God's healing grace from His ministers, A strong point in this subject is that it depicts real life and real people.

A priest enters, blesses them, predicts the crowning of David as King. Jesse sees some people coming. They enter. Princesses Merab and Michal, Prince Jonathan (King Saul's two daughters and son), and Prince Phalti, a suitor for Michal's hand. They have come to command David to appear before King Saul (to play his harp), who is mad and can only be moved by the music from the hills. David consents to depart to King Saul.

Scene II: Saul's Camp. Sentries are keeping watch. Michal wanders through the camp, picking flowers; passes up hill and away, picking more flowers as she goes. Doeg and Omah (brothers) enter.

Jonathan starts a search for the traitor who fired it. The traitor is brought in after the search. On his person is found the rest of the paper on which the defiance was written, around an arrow. Saul is furious and attempts to slay him. His madness is quelled by David's harp playing. Saul appeals to his soldiers to free him from Goliath. They all say: "No one can fight the Giant."

Friend Schneider has been selected to respond to the toast "To the Ladies" at the annual banquet of the Liederkranz, the members feeling that they would hear something great, as Schneider was considered somewhat of a poet by his friends. Schneider goes home to prepare his poetic effusion and is interrupted by the arrival of his sister Lena and her young son Fritz. Now the trouble begins. First Fritz teases the parrot until its squawking annoys Schneider and he cannot write; next it is the phonograph, then a trombone, etc. However, night comes and all is still, when, hark, our friend is startled by mysterious footfalls. Investigating he finds burglars have entered the house, but they are musically inclined and have gathered together the above mentioned instruments of torture, phonograph, trombone, parrot, etc. Hence, Schneider not only helps them on their way, but pays them for what he esteems a blessing.

The rivalry on the part of the latter is friendly, although he is well aware that his position in life does not give him the opportunity of surrounding the girl with the good things of life. The young ship owner's rivalry is of the opposite nature, filled with venom, and he considers it an effrontery that a poor country lad should dare attempt to rival him in the affections of the lady of his choice. The girl is finally put to the test, and in a dramatic scene declares her love for the hero. The unsuccessful ship owner, much angered by his defeat, swears vengeance. Finding the girl alone, the ship owner again attempts to force himself into her favor, but is repulsed. Her infuriated admirer grasps the girl, forcing a kiss upon her lips just as her accepted lover appears upon the scene. The boy, in his anger, knocks the man down, and after a struggle, forces him to apologize. The humiliation hurts him more than the blow, and in his bitterness and anger the ship owner secures the services of some of his seamen attached to a sailing vessel about to leave port and track our young hero as he is leaving a rendezvous with his sweetheart. They attack the youth in a lonely spot, and after a severe struggle, render him insensible and take him aboard the vessel. The lad is forced by the captain to sign articles as an apprentice, then beaten and abused, is made to swab the decks. Biding his time, he strikes the officer in charge, knocking him down. Then plunges overboard and after swimming until he is thoroughly exhausted, reaches the rocks of the shore. (The scenery at this particular point where our hero climbs the rocks with the surf and wild waves dashing about him cannot he excelled.) After eluding the pursuing crew our hero starts back to his lady love's cottage. In the meantime the ship owner has taken into his service a renegade Mexican, and with his aid, after knocking down her old colored servant, kidnaps the now unprotected girl, taking her to an abandoned mission, where he forces an old priest residing there to promise to marry them, regardless of the girl's consent. The youth at last reaches the mainland after a perilous climb over almost inaccessible rocks, and learns from his sweetheart's servitor the story of the outrage. Scarcely able to walk, owing to his former exertions, he secures a horse from a friendly traveler and goes in hot pursuit, reaching the rendezvous just as the final words are about to be spoken. Realizing his helplessness, in his already weakened condition, he grasps a revolver from the Mexican's holster and puts both the ship owner and his accomplice to flight. With his sweetheart in his arms he persuades the priest to repeat the ceremony, and the final words that his unexpected appearance prevented are then spoken that make them man and wife.

Many years later he returns and checks into his parents' inn. They don't recognize him, but noticing his fat wallet, plan to rob him.	Will Sanderson's father kept the village inn, but Will being deeply enamored of pretty Mary Clark had aspirations above the plebeian and rather impecunious calling of village boniface, and so decided to go to the big city and fight for fortune, having read the glowing lines of the biographers of great men who invariably start them on their career as poor country lads. Bidding his sweetheart Mary a fond, but tearful farewell, he then takes his leave of his dear old parents, his mother presenting him with a miniature of herself, as a memento to guide him along the path of righteousness. He is not long in the metropolis when his bright, alert manner appeals to the manager of a banking house and he obtains employment. He had resolved not to return home until he has made a name for himself, and five years later we find him holding a position of responsibility with good salary in the concern. His appearance has somewhat changed, owing to his growing a beard, and one day, taking his mother's picture from his pocket he decides to pay them a visit. The decision is coincident with a letter he receives later during the day. It is from his sweetheart Mary and tells him of his parents' dire straits, which they, through pride, have kept from him. But as they are on the eve of eviction she asks that he help them. Back he goes with his savings, ample to relieve their difficulties, and to surprise them enters the inn and engages a room incog. He has displayed his well-filled wallet in their presence, and their extreme desperation makes them covetous. When the boy lies down for a nap the old father cannot resist, and in securing the wallet arouses the boy, and is forced to knock him on the head. Thinking he had killed his guest, he takes his inert body out and deposits him in the field under the bushes, where he is found later by Mary, who, calling help, assists him to her home nearby, he recovering from the blow on the way. Meanwhile the old couple have gone back to the inn and upon opening the wallet what a revelation: "My God, we have murdered our own boy." They find therein the mother's picture. They are paralyzed with fear and sorrow, so in an almost maniacal condition they go to Mary's home to confess their awful deed. You may imagine their feelings when they are brought face to face with their boy, and dropping on their knees in humble contrition they thank God for the deliverance.

Cumpson	N/A	5.4	5	N/A	One of the members of a suicide club learns he has inherited some money, but only after he drew the fatal lot and is expected to kill himself.	This is a broad comedy subject, the theme of which we often encounter in the newspapers. A body of disgruntled grouches band together in view of shuffling off this mortal coil in a spectacular manner. With this object to the fore the Suicide Club of America holds its monthly meeting to select the next candidate for mortuary honors. Lots are drawn and Frank Fairmount picks the fatal card "23." The President then presents Frank with the necessary skidoo instruments, a pistol, a dagger, a bottle of poison and a rope, and wishes him success. Frank arrives home at the same time as a letter addressed to him which informs him that he has fallen heir to $50,000. Now to commit suicide under these conditions is out of the question. The members are very much upset by not seeing notice of Frank's demise in the newspaper, so they go in a body to ascertain the cause. Frank meets them with a paper to sign releasing him from his oath, but they indignantly refuse until he closes the door and turns on the gas. Now while they would speed the parting guest, they are loath to go with him, so they sign.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:01.177000000

He changes into the policeman's uniform, and is approached by a wife who needs help with her drunken husband.	Tim Noonan and Mary Flinn were sweethearts and both were employed at the paper box factory. Jack Dunn rudely jostles against Mary, which arouses the ire of Tim, who lays Jack out with a powerful blow, for Tim is somewhat of a pugilist. The confusion brings the boss, a bantam, on the scene, who scolds, yes, actually scolds Tim, and Tim picks the boss up bodily, spanks him and quits. For some time he wanders about looking for work, but without success, until he is finally evicted from his boarding house. Discouraged and hungry he passes a restaurant. The sight of the viands in the window emphasizes his already famished condition, so he enters and begs for a bite to eat. The proprietor coldly waves him away with a refusal, and in abject desperation he seizes a piece of pie and runs, overturning everybody who attempts to hinder him. Out of the place he rushes followed by a mob. A policeman joins the pursuers and Tim finding them gaining on him rushes into a vacant house and ascends the stairs. In dashes the copper with such force that he stumbles and drops his gun. Tim seizes this and compels the guardian of the peace to divest himself of his cap and coat, which he puts on. Locking the policeman in the room, he rushes past the mob at the door, who think him the cop. He makes them believe the thief has escaped by the window and sends them one way while he goes the other. Free, he hides in one of the side streets to get his breath. While there an Italian woman rushes up and calls for help, as her husband is at home drunk and threatening to kill them all. Here is trouble. He tries to back out, but the woman insists he being a cop it is his duty to protect her. He goes and with one punch lays the wild Italian out stiff. He then drags him to the station house and receives the praise of the chief for bagging a dangerous and much sought for criminal. He tries to sneak, when in comes the real policeman, who denounces him. The chief, at first enraged, but later, considering his daring deed, appoints him on the force as a full-fledged copper. His star is now in its ascendency, so he visits the factory, calls for Mary and proposes marriage, which she coyly accepts.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:01.600000000

Such was the case with Bob Spaulding, a manly fellow, who meets Dr. Rankin and his wife on the street while they are engaged in a violent tiff. The doctor is about to strike his wife when Bob interferes, incurring the resentment of the doctor. During the flurry Mrs. Rankin drops her card case. From a card inside he learns the address and goes there to return it. They meet, and it is a case of love at first sight; but she is a wife, and beyond his reach. Disconsolate, he leaves, and stops in a neighboring café, where he sits and drinks a glass of beer, his thoughts ever on the sad, sweet face of the abused wife. While thus engaged, a couple of thugs drop knockout in his glass, and when he is well under the influence of the soporific they secure his valuables, and one then gets the card. At their den, after dividing the spoils, the one determines to go to the address on the card, where he is caught in the act by the doctor, whom he shoots in a struggle. Meanwhile, Bob has been thrown out of the café as a drunk, and wanders aimlessly about until he reaches the home of the doctor just as the thug leaves. He seems drawn thither by an irresistible power. Entering by the door left open by the crook, he stumbles and falls over the prostrate form of the doctor, where he lies with the crook's pistol beside him until aroused by the wife, who enters the room. As he slowly regains his reason, the awful imagination of his being a murderer forces itself upon him. There he stands over the lifeless form with pistol in hand, unable to give any account of his actions. The wife, however, doesn't believe him guilty, and allows him to escape. Leaving the city, he obtains employment in another town as machinist in a factory, but still haunted by the false spectre, for he is self-accused of a crime he did not commit. One day, while glancing over the paper, his eye strikes an article headed: "The Mystery Solved," which goes on to state that the real murderer was found dying in a hovel by a Salvation Army girl, and with his last breath confesses to killing of Dr. Rankin. Wild with joy, Bob hastens back to claim the widow, who is now free to listen to his pleadings, which are not in vain.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-09 01:32:57.573000000

Strange as it may seem the poor tramp, who is the hero of this Biograph comedy, finds it hard indeed to get pinched. There is no doubt he could have gotten work, but it is against the rules of his order. The cold weather is pretty trying and he wishes to get under cover, if it has to be in the "jug," so commits most ignoble and lawless deeds, but without success. The police simply ignore him, and often arrest an unoffending person in his stead. He becomes guilty of theft, assault, riot, disorderly conduct, and, in fact, everything but murder, but is still a bird of freedom. It's no use, so despondently he makes his way to the woodyard, resolving to go to work, when a copper meets him at the gate and arrests him, just when he didn't want it.

We lose sight of Bill and Dick is seen up against it good and hard. For him the future looks like a chalk ring on a blackboard, until he happens to saunter along the Bowery, where the manager of a dime museum offers him a job to play the gorilla. It looks good so he accepts. It is pretty sort until the astute impresario decides to pull off an innovation: that is, a gorilla and lion in the same cage. Of course Dick objects most strenuously to this arrangement, but his objections are quailed with a treacherous looking run, so he is forced to share the same menagerie hallroom with the lion. Now the lion is as frightened at the gorilla as the gorilla is at the lion, for they are both fakes. On discovering each other's harmlessness they both decide to mutiny, and upon throwing aside their disguise they, no, yes, it is, Dick, Bill, and they are in each other's arms.

Ten years elapse, and Marion has developed into a cold-hearted woman of society, ever in the vortex of the social swim, until her tender sensibilities become blunted into absolute nonchalance. Henry, meanwhile has fallen into ill health and feels the end of his career is not far distant, so reading in the newspaper of Marion's return from Europe, writes asking her to call that he might see once more the face so dear to him. She is entertaining when the note arrives, so laughs it to scorn, but her company of friends dare her to go, which she does, accompanied by them. What a sight greets her.

Ferrari's pretty daughter, Giannina, was beloved ...	In the little Italian city of Cremona there dwelt Taddeo Ferrari, a violin maker and student of Andrea Amati, the most famous of the craft. Ferrari's pretty daughter, Giannina, was beloved by one of his apprentices, Sandro. Filippo, a crippled youth and the best violin maker in Cremona, also loved the girl with a pure, holy affection that is more spiritual than material, but realizing his unattractiveness through his deformity, suffers his hopelessness with resignation. Yearly there is a prize of a precious chain of gold awarded to the maker of the best violin, and all the apprentices strive to win it. On this occasion, however, the hand of Giannina is to be bestowed upon the most proficient craftsman, and this induces the young men to make extra efforts to win. Sandro fully appreciates the rare talent of Filippo and feels sure his wonderful skill will win his sweetheart from him. Crushed and despairing he seeks out Giannina and tells her his fears, she tearfully acknowledging the strength of his reasoning. While thus occupied they are overheard by Filippo, who sees what woe his success would mean for her, and thinking only of her happiness, through his great love for her he makes a great sacrifice. Going to his room he takes his instrument and goes and places it in Sandro's box, taking Sandro's violin and putting it in his own. Sandro, however, thwarts the good intention of Filippo by exchanging the instruments, not knowing what Filippo had done, thereby upsetting the planned munificence of the cripple. When the instruments are placed in competition, and the prizes are about to be awarded, Sandro's conscience pricks him, and calling the cripple aside, confesses his deed. Filippo bursts into taunting laughter, telling him what he, himself, had done, and now he spoiled it all. Judgment is passed and Filippo is, of course, the victor. The chain is placed about his neck, and the hand of Giannina placed in his. But also, he feels she recoils, and thinking only of her happiness he crashes his violin over his knee, thereby putting himself out of the contest and making Sandro the winner. He then places the chain about Sandro's neck, and handing the girl over to him he rushes from the hall. We finally leave him alone in his room, crushed and dejected, yet contented in the thought that he had made her happy.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-14 00:17:17.557000000

In his anger he joins a communist group who plan to blow up a rich capitalist's house. When he realizes it's Helen's house, he tries to stop the plan.	The romance of a poor German music teacher. Herr Von Schmitt, a young musician, comes to this country from Germany, and ekes a living teaching violin. At home he has become imbued with the doctrines of Karl Marx, the promoter of the communistic principles of socialism, the alleged Utopian scheme of universal co-operation, which in time, and under the control of intemperate minds becomes absolute anarchy. Von Schmitt, however, succeeding in a moderate degree to procure comfort by his art, is gradually being weaned from his former covetous spirit, and turns a deaf ear to the persuasive arguments of his former companions. Among his pupils is Miss Helen Walker, the daughter of a wealthy capitalist. A strong friendship springs up between teacher and pupil, which ripens into love before they are aware of it. Von Schmitt, unable to restrain himself any longer, during a lesson at his studio declares his love, and is, of course, owing to the disparity of rank, spurned. Enraged by the seemingly unreasonable condition of affairs, he hearkens to the argument of his anarchistic friends, and becomes one of their body. At a meeting there takes place a drawing of lots to select the assassins of a certain monopolist, whose name is unknown to him. By a fateful fortuity he is selected as one of the two to do the job. Armed with a bomb, they proceed to the home, a mansion in the swell section of the city, and while one goes into the cellar to place the infernal machine. Von Schmitt stays outside to watch. While there the melody of his own violin composition floats out on the night air, and ascending the stoop he peers through the window and beholds Helen playing the violin. The realization of what is about to happen for the moment rivets him to the spot. This is her home; he had never known it as she always came to his studio for her lessons. To save her he must act quickly. Diving into the cellar he finds his companion has adjusted the bomb and already lighted the fuse. He begs him to desist, but to no purpose. To his entreaty the other replies, "Remember your oath." "To perdition with such oaths, from whence they emanate!" and seizing him an awful struggle ensues. The other man succeeds in overpowering him, and binding him hands and feet leaves him to be destroyed with the rest. With supernatural effort he crawls toward the bomb and with his teeth bites the fuse in two as the fire is within a few inches of the bomb. Calling for help he arouses the household who release him from his position. Well yon may guess what the finish will be. Well it did, and they lived happy ever afterwards.

George Wallace has just finished a term in prison, and, discarding the stripes for a civilian suit, he hurries to his home to be greeted by his wife, child and old mother. The meeting is most touching, the poor wife having, during his incarceration, eked a living for them by manual labor. Wallace decides to start a new life and leaves home in search of work. Armed with a newspaper, he looks up the employment offices advertised therein. During the course of his journey be brushes into a man who is returning to his pocket a well-filled wallet. The pocketbook falls to the ground and the parties pass on, ignorant of the occurrence. A moment later a chap passes the spot and grabbing up the wallet hurries from the scene taking a byway into another neighborhood. Reaching a lonely section of the street, he examines the find, takes the money and throws the wallet away. Now by a cruel trick of fate Wallace passes this way, picks up the purse and is examining it when the owner who has discovered his loss and remembers now of being bumped into by Wallace, comes up, and the evidence certainly looks verifying, so Wallace is arrested. The case is brought to trial before a jury and by a singular fortuity the finder of the money is impaled on the jury. This would seem another subtle trick of derisive fate, for the man himself is not cognizant of the nature of the case upon which he is to sit. You may imagine his amazement when he hears the testimony and is banded with the others the incriminating wallet. To anyone with the most meager powers of discernment the ease looks clearly a case of theft against Wallace. What could be more convincing, his brushing against the plaintiff while in the act of returning the money to his pocket, and then being found with the wallet in his hand: worse still is the fact of his being an ex-convict. The retiring of the jury to their room seemed but as a matter of form, so you may imagine their surprise when the ballot results in eleven to convict and one to acquit. It is easy to guess who cast the one dissenting vote, the real offender. Arguments, entreaties, threats are all in vain; he stubbornly refuses to change his opinion. Well, they at length decide to give up the hope of agreeing, and are about to return to court, when the man calls them back, and under their promise of secrecy restores the money to the purse. They then file into court and to the surprise of all render a verdict of "not guilty." The wallet, with its contents, is secretly returned to the owner.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:55.160000000

It is the old story: he soon tires of her and cruelly deserts her. Poor Alice is then forced to fight her own way, as to return home she dare not. In this she succeeds so well that at her place of employment, where she fills the position of typist, she inspires in the manager a kindly interest by her modest demeanor, which feeling ripens into love culminating in their marriage. While out walking she is seen and recognized by her first husband, who turns up after being supposed dead. He has sunk into the depths of debauchery and he at once resolves to force his presence upon her. Sending a bogus telegram to her husband he decoys him away from home at night, and then makes his way to their home. Just previous to his arrival, a burglar breaks into the house, leaving the window open behind. Through this he crawls and the burglar hearing his intrusion conceals himself behind the portières. Alice hearing a noise, goes to learn the cause and when she sees Harris is dumbfounded. He locks the door and seizes the poor frightened woman and in the struggle backs against the burglar who fires and kills him. At this moment the husband returns and finding the door locked is at once suspicious. The position of Alice is indeed compromising until an idea strikes her. She bids the burglar decamp leaving his tools behind, which escape he is glad to make, and when the husband bursts into the room she stands over the prostrate form of her former spouse, with the pistol in her hand and pretends the lifeless body is that of a burglar whom she has shot.

So it was that the aforementioned article of wearing apparel brought about justice on the one hand and future happiness on the other for the young courtier upon whose shoulders it hung. This gallant youth, handsome, ambitious and brave, mild in manner, but quick to resent an insult, engages in a duel with another of the court, and is surprised by the King, who has issued a strong edict against dueling. For the offense he is arrested but paroled. Now, the young fellow is deeply enamored of one of the ladies of the court, to meet whom he breaks his parole. He is caught, stripped of his regalia and banished from court. There is among the courtiers a party of conspirators who have plotted to abduct the Queen and hold her hostage for ransom. At the tavern, the leader is given a letter setting forth their plans, which he cautiously reads and thrusts into his coat pocket, and sits down to while away the time gambling. Our hero enters and being despondent wishes to forget his woe by entering the game, but he has only his hat and plume to wager, still this is accepted. The fates are with him: he wins again and again until he has the party cleaned, the conspirator even of his sword and coat. Putting on the coat, he feels the letter in the pocket, and reading it learns "climb to the balcony hall at midnight. We seize the Queen then." He decides at once to save the Queen and hurries to the balcony hall through the window and has barely time to hide in a large clock when three conspirators enter. At this moment the Queen appears on the way to her apartments, and the conspirators creep out to perpetrate their foul design, when our hero leaps to the fore, and taking them so by surprise he manages to hold them at bay until assistance comes, for this deed he is not only released from his parole, but is given the hand of his sweetheart and dubbed Knight. So much for the Winning Coat.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:08:04.363000000

Dejected they leave the room, when a one-legged hobo attracts Harry's attention. An idea! He calls in the tramp and suggests Claire put on the wooden leg, the tramp to hide in the closet. Well the ancient swain appears and presses his suit, which is received with nonchalance by Claire, but when he sees the tip of the wooden leg protruding from beneath the flounce of her skirt he turns and "beats it" with such dispatch that he knocks Papa over when he tries to detain him.

A few of us have had the chance to read our own obituary notice, but it fell to the lot of John Goodhusband the rare privilege of viewing his own elegiac cinerary floral offerings, and at the time John was anything but a "dead one." It happened thusly: John, after office hours, meets a couple of his erstwhile chums, who prevail upon him to go with them to the show and make a jolly old-time bachelorhood night of it. Now John is fully alive to his duties as a benedict, but it is hard to resist the temptation, so he yields and sends Mrs. Goodhusband a telegram that he had left on the Red Eagle Express for Freeport on business, and will return in the morning. The trio then repair to the Empire Theater, where the Burlesque Company is playing, of which La Tunita, the Queen of the Orient, is the bright peculiar star. To say they enjoy the show is putting it mildly, and after the performance they play the role of stage door Johnnies, inducing several of the show girls to join them in several cold bottles and hot birds at a neighboring lobster palace. Meanwhile, an "extra" evening paper is handed Mrs. Goodhusband, which contains the alarming news that the Red Eagle Express has been "wrecked and all on board killed." Sorry her lot; a widow so early in the game. Well, she dons the weeds and hies herself to the florist and orders a suitable floral tribute, a large wreath of roses, with the word "R-E-S-T" worked in violets. All this time John is having a rip-roaring good time piling up an iridescent souse, arriving in the gray of morning to a house of mourning, where he is met by his own widow. Shown the newspaper, he feels some eclaircissement is due the lachrymose Mrs. Goodhusband, so he sets to work his fabricating faculties, and in lucid terms tells how he, the lone survivor of the calamity, at the risk of his own life endeavored to save others, dragging them from the wreck. He plays the noble hero in the eyes of Mrs. G. until the maid enters with the morning paper, which states that the account of the wreck was all a mistake; it never happened. Poor John is now up against it for fair, and he certainly would have come out badly but for the arrival at this moment of the wreath, which presents to the Mrs. the thought of what might have been, hence she weakens, with a promise from John that to his bachelor traits he exclaim "requiescat in pace."

A bored young man of means decides that it would be a lark to masquerade as an evangelist and preach outside the "dance hall" of the town in which he is living. One of the young dance hall girls hears the phony preacher and is greatly moved by his message. The girl leaves the dance hall and goes to her room, where, weeping, she kneels and prays. Her life is changed, and she now becomes a dedicated settlement house worker. One day the girl encounters the young man. He, of course, is not now in disguise; and he is falling down drunk. At first the girl is disillusioned, but then she realizes that, although his words were falsely delivered, their message was nonetheless her salvation. The young man slinks away, but now he, too, sees the light. Soon he goes out to look for the girl, and he finds her assisting an old man who has fallen on the road. Their eyes meet and we can tell that this is a new beginning for the two converts.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:28.910000000

Miss Florabel Thurston is betrothed to Ben Lawrence, a young artist. One day while at work in his studio, a poor little flower seller calls to sell her blossoms. She is cold and hungry, and Lawrence sits her down before the lunch spread for him, but which he has not touched. It happens that Miss Thurston drops in at the studio at this time and, finding the flower girl and aware that she is not a model, leaves abruptly in a huff. Under the influence of her mother (who has long been cheated on by Mr. Thurston), Florabel is about to break off the engagement. The flower girl however, learning of the trouble she has innocently caused, hastens to put things right. Explanations bring a reconciliation of Ben and Florabel.

Feeling sorry for him, Adonese helps him up and buys him a new suit of clothes.

Only her boss knows the combination, and he is off on a journey. Can the boss's son locate his absent-minded father before it is too late for the girl?	An absent-minded business man is about to be off on a journey. He leaves his son and his secretary (who, unbeknownst to him, are in love) in charge of the office. The two soon find the boss's wallet on the floor, and the son rushes off to catch up with his father. While he's gone, a poor vendor seizes the opportunity to turn robber. He grabs the secretary's purse and locks her in the airtight vault. The son returns, and soon he becomes aware of his beloved's plight. He doesn't know and cannot find the combination to the vault, so off he goes again to catch dear old dad. He just misses dad's train and sends a telegram ahead to have his father return immediately. But dad wasn't on the train. He had forgotten important papers that he needed for the trip. Now he's back at the office, blissfully unaware that his secretary is dying just a few feet away. Then off he goes again. The son returns and is told (by a man who was unaware of the secretary's plight) that he has just missed his father. Away the son rushes again. This time he catches up with dad. Back they run to the office, and the girl is freed in the very nick of time.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:34.380000000

Young Hank took Miss Bird into the cafe, with one silver dollar in his pocket. There were some nice large glasses of beer to be obtained for five cents, but this she spurned, for the menu of that day was very alluring. It was aristocratic food, not plebeian drink she desired, and so she starts to order. Surprised groans from Hank. But the worst is yet to come. Several friends of Miss Bird appear. "Why, boys! You're just in time to join us." Hank (sotto voce), "And I only have a dollar." The meal is over; the boys have departed regaled and poor Hank is longer and leaner than ever, but the bill presented him, while long, is by no means lean. "And I only have a dollar." The dollar the waiter takes as a tip, and Hank's watch and pin are left behind to liquidate the bill. Not only that. On leaving the cafe. Miss Bird meets a gentleman friend and shakes Hank unceremoniously. As Hank views their forms fading in the distance, he murmurs, "I shall hie me to the lemon grove where I belong." He does.

No land nor period was more given to romance than the Spanish American in the early part of the 19th century. The influence of the warm constant sun, without excessive amenity was conducive to lethargy and lethargy is the seed of romance. The dreamer is a romancer. This Biograph story starts some time before Mexican independence was proclaimed in California, which occurred in 1822. Perdita Arguello, the pretty Spanish senorita is beloved by Jose Manuella, a wealthy young Spaniard, who migrated to the new world in search of adventure. A man of qualities, he surrenders claim upon the girl when he finds her heart is given to Pedro Cortes, a handsome troubadour of the village. Cortes is just the sort of fellow to impress a thoughtless and unsophisticated girl with his gentle persuasive manner together with his talent as a musician. Of poetic temperament, she yields to his plan and marries him. But what a calamity! Twenty years later we see the result of her folly. Cortes proved to be a worthless dipsomaniac and reprobate. Spending his time and money she earns at the tavern. The most unfortunate feature is that they have a son, now nearly 19 years old. Perdita realizes that the environs and example of the father are not favorable to the boy's well-being, hence she resolves to save him. It is at a time when Baja and Alta California are in conflict, and Manuella, Perdita's former lover, is now Governor. So she appeals to him to provide a future for their son. The Governor takes the boy into his own company. But is there any wonder that the son of such a dog as Cortes should prove himself to be a despicable whelp? He is not long in the service when the blood of his father asserts itself. Drunkenness is one of the first offenses. Next theft of the meanest order, that of robbing his sleeping comrades-in-arms. Perdita has dispatched a letter of thanks to the Governor, which he is reading as the drunken boy is brought before him. The tone of the letter induces Manuella to be easy on the boy that she might live in ignorance of his real nature. However, later she writes that she is dying and believing her son has made a name for himself, she asks to be allowed to see him before she dies. As the Governor reads this letter the boy is brought before him, having been caught for thieving. Manuella is thoroughly disgusted with the boy, but in order to have his mother die happy, he decorates him, making him appear before her as a hero. When she breathes her last the medals are torn his breast and he is sent to prison where the punishment he justly deserves is inflicted. In this subject are shown a series of most beautiful scenes of Southern California, which are photographically perfect.	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:29.647000000

Little Wolf, chief of a band of roving Sioux, has purchased a fine horse. When he reaches camp a half-breed member of the tribe is very much taken with the animal and tries to secure him, but the chief is obdurate. The half-breed finally offers his squaw, a saddle and two blankets to no avail. Then, in his rage at falling to make the trade, brutally ill-treats the wife, who stoically receives her lord and master's blows without resentment. The next day a ranch owner arrives at the Indian camp, and his offer for Little Wolf's horse is more alluring than the half-breed's, and he departs with the horse, to the half-breed's chagrin. Determined to make one more effort to secure the equine, the half-breed loads his squaw with a large sack of beadwork, and we next find them in front of the ranch owner's home. Again he fails, and in his anger attempts to carry off a jug of whiskey and an overcoat. The owner returns and the miscreant gets a sound thrashing. Revenge is his one idea now, and he takes it in a very cowardly fashion. Filled with remorse, he returns to his squaw, and in the confines of their narrow home tells her of his crime. The ranch owner finds a dead horse in his stable yard the next day, and also a piece of cloth that has evidently been torn from the sleeve of a coat as its wearer passed through the bars. One of his herders recognizes the cloth as having come from the coat of the half-breed. A posse is organized, and the camp is visited. The half-breed's guilt is established and the sheriff is sent for, a guard being placed over the half-breed in his tepee. It is here we witness the acme of devotion. The half-breed is cowering in terror, but his squaw has been thinking, and her brain has evolved a plan for saving her husband. "Quick, Fire Lightning, you must take my clothes, and as a squaw leave the lodge; I will be you, and when the white law comes he can take me to the jail corral." Imagine the sheriff's astonishment when he starts to handcuff the prisoner the ranch herders have guarded so carefully to find that it is the wife and the half-breed's clothes that he has arrested, while the culprit is far on his way to the Bad Lands, where pursuit is useless. The ranch owner refuses to prosecute the squaw.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-07 07:06:47.563000000

The husband, one of the miners in the camp, dies, and the rough men gather to tell her of her loss. She does not survive the news long, and the little child is left alone. How the miners take up a collection for the "kid" contributing personal ornaments, revolvers, knives and even a whisky bottle, is laughable. Finally, the child, in playing near the camp, discovers gold, and this leads to its formal adoption by the camp.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:01:15.020000000

Dick Harcourt and Dora Dean are both cruelly jilted by their sweethearts. Each of them vows never to marry. Dick even goes so far as to join the Anti-marriage Club. But the sub-title of this film is "A Comedy Of Errors Corrected By Cupid"; and now that mischievous lad goes to work. Dick and Dora (strangers, mind you) are traveling on the same train; and by accident(?) they sit together. Now Dick, on his way to the train station, had gotten some grains of rice stuck to his clothing by accident(?). Also, by accident(?) a member or Dick's Anti-Marriage Club is riding on the same train. He sees the "couple", sees the rice, and puts one and one together to get two married people. He wires ahead to the Club members that Dick is a traitor. When the train arrives the Club members have arranged a mock reception party for Dick and Dora. But many of the good citizens of the town take the thing seriously, and soon Dora has a pile of wedding gifts. Well, a couple of well placed darts later, Dick and Dora decide not to return those gifts; and, to quote the Biograph Bulletin, "Cupid lands a knockout."	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-14 00:07:30.287000000

The McMahons are in trouble and old McMahon has been forced to mortgage the homestead. The money lender has been lenient up to this time, but, struck by the beauty of Nona McMahon, he endeavors to win her love. But she declines his offer. The lender, named McDermott, threatens foreclosure. In the meantime, Malone has been idle. It is his desire to make one grand coup and quit the game for good. He hears that the mountain stage coach is soon to carry a large amount of gold, and he decides to make a try for the loot. The hold-up occurs, but it's not as profitable as he expected. Also, he fears his identity has been discovered. He returns to his dugout, resolved to see his sweetheart and then quit the country. On his way to the girl's home he sees a notice posted by the sheriff, offering a reward of $5,000 for Malone's capture. He shoots down the sign and rides off to McMahon's. The girl greets him pleasantly. Their conversation drifts to McMahon's financial troubles, and the girl shows Malone a note from McDermott, stating that $5,000 must be paid the day after or they must vacate.

Here is a warning to all who are of a revengeful nature, as the plans may sometimes revert to our chagrin if not disaster. The two young fellows are rivals for the hand of a pretty girl of the village, and after her marriage with the one of her choice, the other swears to be revenged. To effect this he pours chemically treated oil into the irrigation ditches of the husband's farm. This of course ruins the land for vegetation, but it brings the husband a fabulous hum from a speculator in oil lands, who thinks he has struck a highly productive oil field.

One day when the girl has grown into a lovely young woman, she meets a prosperous and handsome older man through a strange twist of fate. They fall in love and are engaged to be married. On the very day of the wedding the poor mother wanders to the farmer's house. She sees a picture of her daughter as a three year old and recognizes her. Learning that the girl is to be married that day, the mother rushes to the church. When she arrives there she and the groom recognize one another, and immediately they both realize that Ben has nearly married his own daughter.

George is addicted to the smoking habit, in fact he might be termed a "Tobacco Fiend." To Alice, his wife, the fumes of tobacco smoke are extremely odious, and after a deal of persuasion he yields to her plea, swearing never to smoke the weed again. At first it seems possible, but later there comes such an insatiable craving he can stand it no longer, so he rents a quiet place where he goes and smokes in peace. All goes well, until his better half notices the regularity of his little walks, ostensibly for exercise, and she grows suspicious of she knows not what. However, she is determined to satisfy herself as to whether or not her hubby tells the truth. Quite the little surprise is in store for both man and wife.

Ranch hand Bob Gorman decides this is the time to proclaim his love for Molly, and Daddy is not pleased by this revelation. But Bob is an excellent hand and Molly is going away, so Mr. Hendricks keeps Bob on. However, after one year Molly is coming back home; and Bob makes no secret of the fact that his feelings haven't changed. Daddy and Bob get into a heated argument which proves too much for the old man's heart, and he dies.

Chased off by the antics of Hank the Mule, Dorothy ends up in her cornfield, where she realizes her family's Scarecrow is alive. She helps him down and he takes a tumble on the turnstyle. A cyclone soon arrives and leaves Dorothy, Scarecrow, Toto and Hank spinning around on a haystack, with Imogene the Cow flying soon after. Soon after their arrival, the Wizard of Oz issues a public decree that he is a humbug, to make sure no one ever finds out. Glinda pops up out of the background and transforms Toto into a man in a bulldog suit to serve as a better protector for Dorothy. Then they encounter the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and Eureka. Nevertheless, she is captured by Momba, the Wicked Witch of the West (suggesting Baum thought the other witches were Mombe, Mombo, and Mombu, in keeping with the council in _Queen Zixi of Ix_) and her flying lizards and soldiers. Dorothy defeats Momba, and they arrive at the Emerald City just in time for the Wizard's going away party.	English	USA	N/A	2015-03-07 04:13:16.007000000

He is refused employment at "Double Circle Ranch." As he is leaving the place, he meets the ranchman's daughter and they are mutually impressed with each other. The owner of the ranch receives a letter saying that cattle-rustlers are operating in the vicinity. On his way home Jack accidentally walks into the camp of the cattle thieves. After questioning him, he is given employment, which he accepts, much against his will. Intent on his work, he does not see the ranchman's daughter approaching from behind. She covers him with her revolver, but Jack tells her his troubles. Still suspicious, the girl proceeds to the hut occupied by he and his mother, and finding things corresponding with Jack's words, she gives money to his mother. Relieved of immediate worries, Jack goes back to his mining ventures and strikes it rich. One day as Jack was visiting the ranchman's daughter, a creditor called upon the now ruined owner with a bill, which he was unable to meet. Jack, however, returned the favor of the girl, by closing the account.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-05 00:07:05.460000000

Edna's brother, Fred, does not like Fremont, and objects to him paying attention to his sister. As the ranchmen in the vicinity are missing cattle, it looks very much as if there were an active rustler around. Fremont (who is the rustler), sees a chance to divert the suspicion from himself upon young Curtis, and informs his employer that he has good reasons for believing Curtis is the rustler. Fremont's employer, while in town, secures the services of a cowboy by the name of Curly Hitchcock (who is a crack shot), to run down the cattle thief. Curly, while on the range, accidentally discharges his gun, receiving a flesh wound, and rushes to the nearest house of Edna Curtis, and her willingness to aid him excites his admiration. A short while after, Curly returns to the ranchman who has employed him, and taking a powerful telescope, rides out on the range. There, he meets Edna. Fremont comes upon them, and when Curly rides away, Fremont tells Edna that her bother is a rustler, and that Curly has been employed to capture him. Frightened, she hurries to her home to tell her folks and to hide her brother. A few hours after Curly left Edna and Fremont, he notices, through his powerful telescope, Fremont driving off a herd of cattle. The ranchmen are now infuriated, as they have discovered that more cattle have been stolen, and believe that the gun-man is a fake. Curly arrives at the Curtis home, just in time to get a shot at Fremont, who has led a number of ranchmen to Curtis' home to hang Fred. Everything ends happily, and Fremont gets his just deserts.

They live in a squalid home, made more wretched by his inability to provide sufficient food. He goes out in search of work, but is unsuccessful. Finally, in desperation, he steals a loaf of bread regardless of consequences. He hastens home with it, pursued by a crowd, and gives it to his mother. Valjean is arrested for the theft and sentenced to five years at hard labor. He with other convicts, is put in a stone quarry, and there makes his first acquaintance with Javert, a prison guard, who appears prominently throughout the story. The first notice Javert takes of Valjean is on account of his great strength in lifting a stone that no other prisoner can lift. In the prison dormitory word is whispered about that there is a chance for one man to escape, and among themselves the prisoners decide that they will draw lots to determine the one who shall make the break for liberty. The lot falls to Valjean, and with the aid of a small saw, he is soon in the open. The alarm is given and pursuit is begun, but Valjean eludes his pursuers. Javert is greatly vexed at the escape, for he is an automatic creature in doing his duty. He performs his duty like a machine, and his duty comes before everything else with him. Like a hunted animal, Valjean reaches the town of Digne, in southern France. He begs from door to door, but meets with many rebuffs, until one kind hearted woman directs him to the house of the parish priest, Myriel. The good priest takes him in, feeds him, and provides him with a cot for the night. In the night Valjean yields to temptation. He steals a pair of silver spoons, and departs. On the road he meets two "gendarmes" who take him back to the town, and before the priest. To his surprise Valjean is given a pair of silver candlesticks by the priest who dismisses the police, pretending that Valjean is an old acquaintance. Myriel then gives Valjean a letter to his brother, a manufacturer of glass beads in Montreuil. The action of the priest touches Valjean's heart and he repents bitterly of his wrongful act. He goes to Montreuil and is given a position by the priest's brother and is thenceforth known as "Mr. Madeleine."	French	France	N/A	2014-12-17 00:05:50.843000000

Her daughter, recently returned from an Eastern boarding school, could not assist her and, although the cowboys in her employ were faithful, the ranch needed an executive head. John Morgan, a neighboring ranchman, had long cast envious eyes upon the widow's increasing herd of cattle, and desired to marry the daughter in order to obtain possession of her ranch. He offers to manage her affairs for her, but the widow distrusts him and refuses his offer. Mrs. Kendall finally secures the services of Jim Stevenson, a manly young cowboy, and he is introduced to the boys as the new manager. They take him out on the range that he may become better acquainted with his new duties. They encounter John Morgan, who is ordered off the range by the new manager. Morgan determines to force his attention on Hazel Kendall and hurries to the ranch house. He finds Hazel alone and attempts to kiss her when Jim, coming to the house to report, witnesses the struggle and rescues her from the distasteful caress. Mrs. Kendall orders Morgan to leave her premises and he goes away with hatred seething in his heart. He returns to his ranch and plans a most diabolical revenge.

The Sheriff of Kickup Gulch had long been enamored of the beautiful daughter of the hotel keeper and his suit was progressing favorably when an eastern drummer appeared in the Gulch and started paying marked attentions to the hotel-keeper's daughter. She was very favorably impressed and, finding it difficult to choose between the two after their simultaneous proposal, decided to give them a test of bravery in order to win her hand. The test consisted of thrusting an arm in a rattlesnake's hole and the drummer became panic stricken, for he knew that it meant almost certain death to obey the request. The Sheriff, however, knowing that rattlesnakes always avoid tobacco, sprinkled the hole with tobacco from his pouch and thrust in his arm with impunity. Of course the lady chose the sheriff and left the crestfallen drummer to think it over. Left to his own devices he discovers the trick played by the wily sheriff, and determines to even up the score. He effects an entrance to the general store and substitutes iron filings for the stock of giant powder. The next day he appears at the store and makes a purchase of several pounds of his substituted giant powder. Returning to the hotel he creates a panic by spreading his powder on a paper and sitting beside it with a lighted cigar in his mouth. The frightened spectators send for the sheriff to subdue the mad man, and he now appears with his fiancé, gun in hand, to arrest the drummer. The drummer calmly lights a match and orders, "Drop that gun or I'll drop this match," which he holds at close proximity to his fake powder. The sheriff is panic stricken and turns in ignominious flight, leaving his fiancé to her fate. The fate in store for her however, is a complete revulsion of feeling and she decides that eastern wit is better than cheap heroics.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:16:10.757000000

One day he takes from a drawer the money as rent to his mother, the caretaker of the premises. He is the cause of suspicion being cast upon his innocent parent and her ultimate ejection from her home and position of trust. The poor woman has to struggle on alone, and manages to eke out a bare existence by very rough work, ending deeper into the mire on the road to ruin. John one night proceeds with a companion to break into a house. Searching around the room, he has failed to discover anything of the slightest value, but is almost struck helpless by the sight of a portrait hanging upon the wall of the meagerly furnished apartment. With a shock he recognizes it as that of his father, and is so overcome that he drives his companion away, determined that he will never again commit such sins. While in an attitude of penitence, he is surprised by the entry of his poor wearied mother, who has returned from her daily toil almost worn out with fatigue. The influence of a good father has been sufficient to recall the better nature of John into activity. He discards his bad associates and becomes the support and comfort of his poor old mother for the remainder of her days.	French	France	N/A	2015-02-23 00:09:41.227000000

The daughter makes a hit with the storekeeper and it is with difficulty that the ranch man induces his daughter to leave. They return home, and the ranch man finds a letter in his mail box from Wm. Schrider, Attorney-at-Law, informing him that his brother is dead, and has left the sum of three million dollars to his daughter, on condition that she produce an official certificate of her marriage one month from the date of her uncle's death. He hurries to the house with the glad information, and his wife rejoices with him. They call Estella, and are astounded when she refuses to get married. The ranch man offers his cowboys one thousand dollars each if they will help him. He suggests that they go to town and kidnap a handsome man and also abduct his daughter. Accordingly, some of the boys are detailed to abduct the daughter, others to kidnap the handsome storekeeper, and the ranch man himself goes after a justice of the peace. The daughter is secured with little difficulty, but Arthur White puts up a strenuous fight before he is tied up. Leaving their captives bound and blindfolded, the cowboys repair to the opposite side of the barn for a friendly game of cards. Arthur succeeds in freeing himself and is very much surprised to find his fellow victim is the girl that has captivated his fancy. They mount a horse and ride away. The cowboys discover that their captives have escaped and start in pursuit.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-12 00:08:00.230000000

Consequently he is highly elated when John Darrow, foreman of the 'X Bar' outfit, offers him a job punching cows. He is fitted out at the ranch in chaps, spurs, sombrero, etc., and feels that he is a regular cowboy. On his first appearance in his new outfit the boys work their game of gun music on him and, in this instance, are treated to a genuine Yiddisher dance. Ikey is very angry, but bides his time until he can even up the score. He learns the work on the ranch and one day succeeds in roping a cow, thinking he has roped a steer. Payday the boys follow their time-honored custom and go to town to celebrate. Ikey, however, with true business instinct, remains at the ranch and, during the cowboy's absence, gets out his old peddling pack and sets up a pawn shop in a corner of the ranch yard. The boys return from town broke and when Ikey shows them his pawn shop they decide to 'hock' their guns. Ikey gets possession of every gun on the ranch and then starts to do a little shooting himself. The boys scatter at his approach and the Yiddisher cowboy is monarch of all he surveys.

Young and extremely handsome, with a fine personality, Jack Williams makes quite an impression on the ranch owner's daughters, and he is himself attracted to the elder sister. During his absence the foreman becomes inflamed with socialistic ideas by attending socialistic gatherings and listening to impassioned speeches by hot-headed men. He returns to the ranch with his head full of socialism and finds that the new ranch hand has made great headway with the ranch owner's daughter, whom he had hoped to win himself. He attempts to force his attentions on her, but finds them unwelcome, and when he carries it to the point of rudeness her father interferes, thereby gaining his foreman's enmity. In order to retaliate for his suffered grievance he stirs up the cowboys with whiskey and talk gleaned from socialistic meetings. Under his leadership the boys are ready to fight and in this dangerous mood the foreman leads a delegation to the ranchman with a demand that he divide his wealth equally among them. Reasoning and argument do not avail and the ranchman finds that of all his employees Jack Williams is the only one that remains loyal. Finding that their demands are not complied with the cowboys prepare to fight and a desperate battle takes place between the gang, the ranch owner and Jack. The wife and daughters witness the fight and see the father wounded. Jack leads them all to a pit where they will be safe, and continues the fight alone. A stray bullet strikes the foreman, and without a leader the cowboys soon see their folly, and hostilities cease. Jack finds that his brave defense of her father's home, has convinced the girl that he could defend one of his own and they make their plans accordingly.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:20:02.007000000

Yielding to the insistent entreaties of his father, mother and a friendly priest, Bob Carroll goes away, much against his natural desires, to become a priest, after promising to marry his sweetheart, Anna Catherwood. Anna, piqued at Bob's adherence to parental wishes, hastily marries a working boy, Jim Whitcomb, and in the six years that follow, becomes addicted to liquor. Jim, himself, a drunkard, comes home one day to find Anna drunk and carousing. In the scene that followed, Anna, laughing derisively, informs Jim that Bob, now a devout priest, is the father of their six-year-old child. After that Anna takes the downward path and Jim finds consolation in saloons. One day, on charity bent, Father Bob goes into the slums. Accidentally he finds the child, and thinking it one of the city's waifs, notifies his mother to call and get it. Entering a dive, Bob is horrified to find Anna--"not as they parted in the years gone by"--but Anna is too drunk to recognize Bob. REEL 2.--Mrs. Carroll called with Bob and took the child to the Society of Cruelty to Children. Anna returning one day, finds Bob's note telling of the child's whereabouts. Mrs. Carroll often met Anna at the Society's office, and finally succeeded in bringing about the reformation of the woman, little knowing her identity. She adopted the child and secured work for Anna as a nurse. Later, Anna, now on her upward path, stepped into a church in search of spiritual consolation. There, face to face, she met Bob, praying at the foot of a cross. There, for the first time, Bob learned that he was the father of Anna's child--a frightful revelation that spelled the day of death for the gentle-hearted priest. One afternoon Mrs. Carroll, Bob, and the child went for an auto ride. They ran down Jim Whitcomb as he staggered from a saloon. At the hospital, there was a moment of recognition and understanding--a moment of horror during which Mrs. Carroll understood that her adapted child was really her grand-child: Anna, that this good woman benefactor was the mother of Bob; Bob, that he had kept in his own home as his mother's ward, his own child--and all of them knew that the end of Jim Whitcomb had come. Falling at his feet, Father Bob whispered, "Forgive me, for I knew not what I did." In his study the next day they found Father Bob, sitting upright in his chair, tightly clutching the big crucifix on his desk, his glassy eyes fastened on the Savior. Bending over him, Mrs. Carrol and Anna heard his stiffened lips mutter: "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give thee rest."	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-04 00:45:57.117000000

When she discovers that a slave named Pharon professes his love for her, Cleopatra makes a bargain with him: she will give him ten days of "love," at the end of which he is to commit suicide. He agrees, although the queen's handmaiden Iras, in love with the slave, isn't happy with the arrangement. Later when Cleopatra is seducing Marc Antony, her relationship with Pharon is used against her, but with little effect.

The poet Dante is lost in a dark and gloomy wood. At the summit of a mountain he sees the light of salvation. He endeavors to ascend to it, but his way is barred by three wild beasts, symbolizing Avarice, Pride and Lust. Beatrice sees his predicament and descends from Paradise into Limbo, where she asks the poet Virgil to rescue and guide Dante. Virgil knows another way to go, but this leads straight through the entire Inferno, before it continues towards Paradise. Virgil leads Dante to the portals of Inferno. Charon ferries them over the river Acheron, and then they start their journey downwards through the different circles of Inferno. Dante meets all kind of sinners and sees the never-ending punishments they have to undergo. The various punishments are adjusted to the different transgressions. Among the sinners Dante recognizes many persons he has met in Florence, when they were still alive. They tell him their sad stories and why they have ended here. At last Dante and Virgil meets the arch traitor Lucifer, who holds the bodies of Brutus and Cassius in his mouth. The two poets climb down the shaggy sides of Lucifer, to reach the subterranean way which leads out of Inferno.	Italian	Italy	N/A	2014-11-22 19:20:43.953000000

The hot blooded gypsy snake tamer is passionately in love with the attractive young man, hut he does not quite return her feelings. She is hasty and ill-tempered, and not far from being cruel to those depending on her. For the first time the Flying Circus pitches its tents in a small country town. The daughter of the mayor attends. The rope dancer meets her and for him it is a case of love at first sight, and he decides to do all in his power to win her. That night a great fire breaks out in the town, and the flying embers ignite the home of the mayor. The townspeople strive to deflect the flames, but all in vain. The mansion is doomed to destruction and it seems that the mayor's daughter must perish. At this juncture Laurento beats his way through the flames and scales the wall, and, picking up the frantic maiden, jumps to the mesh of telegraph wires outside the window. Carrying his burden over the fragile wires, he saves her amid the frantic cheers of the populace. The grateful mayor makes him a welcome guest, and he soon wins the heart of the young girl, but he has yet to obtain the father's consent. He worries continually about this problem, and not even at home can he rest in peace, for Ula Kiri, who feels that her beloved friend is sliding away from her, keeps tormenting him with jealousy and mockery. At last he plucks up his courage and goes to the mayor. The latter is friendly to the young man, but he compels the rope dancer to leave with a vague promise for the future. If circumstances, should alter. A capital idea strikes the young man to obtain money. He arranges to do a rope dance to the church tower. The circus director is delighted with the idea. The great day arrives, and the people of the town gather around the church. The rope dancer cannot forget Erna's sorrowful eyes and pale face as he walks along the flaccid rope towards the dizzy height. A snake has escaped and its body bars the way to the entrance to the tower. The snake tamer has, in her mad jealousy, forgotten all about her duties, and this negligence now proves fatal. Erna implores her in vain to call back the reptile, as she is the only one that can do it, but Ula Kiri will not listen to her in her storm of jealousy and hatred. But Erna overcomes all difficulties. Her great love teaches her what to do, and thus she saves her sweetheart. The mayor can no longer withhold his consent to the marriage and the same evening the Flying Circus goes away to the other regions, leaving a happy couple in the country town.

Lieutenant Muller, secretly married, lives with his parents and his married sister, but chafes under the conditions and wishes they could all live together, which is impossible owing to his wife's lack of social standing. Muller is fond of horses and rides his own horse in the steeplechase, a big society event. His horse falls and Muller is fatally injured. On his death bed he tells his secret and implores his parents to care for his wife and little boy. They are taken into the family, but incur the displeasure of Muller's brother-in-law, who sees in the lad a possible claimant for his grandfather's fortune, which the brother-in-law hopes to inherit. He offers Muller's widow some money if she will go away with the boy. She spurns this but leaves with her son and tries to make a living by sewing. She does not succeed and finally yields to the proposal of her son's grandmother that she will adopt the boy, but cannot receive his mother. Some time afterward seeing her son in the park with his nurse, she seizes him and jumps in the lake, intending to end both their lives, but they are rescued by some men. For this act the mother is sentenced to a long term in prison. When she gets out she is old, and her son, now grown op, is a military cadet, still living with his grandparents who are very proud of him. His old mother gets employment as a scrub woman, but is soon discharged for incompetency and she wanders about in search of work. Her son comes across her as she lays fainting in the road, while some boys are ridiculing her. He drives them off and carries her home, where he finds out that she is his mother.

The mosquito slips into the room where the man is sleeping, and gets ready for a meal. His first attempts startle the man and wake him up, but the mosquito is very persistent.	What is a mosquito's nature? A large man enters his flat; a mosquito in top hat with valise follows, entering through the window above door. The man goes to sleep; the mosquito lands next to him, opens the valise, and takes out a grinding wheel to sharpen his proboscis. Methodically, the mosquito gets one, two, then three drinks as the man tosses, slaps, turns, covers himself, and rubs the wounds. After a fourth drink, the mosquito is so full he can barely right himself. Still he has more. Bloated, he can only hover above the sleeping man's face. Suspense builds: can he launch? He's atop his victim's nose. He jettisons his valise. Will he now be light enough to escape?	N/A	USA	N/A	2014-12-30 00:24:55.190000000

The widow's son has a locket containing a photograph of his mother, which the gambler wishes to have, but as the boy is unwilling to sell it to him, Hughes leaves and writes a proposal to the widow. Her refusal incites him to indulge in drink more freely, until he is soon reduced to a derelict. Ten years later, while walking up a street in a western town, he asks the widow's son (whom he does not recognize) for a few pennies. In pulling out the money from his pockets the locket drops and a mutual recognition follows. Hughes steers the boy into a saloon, where he loses the money with which he was to pay the ranch help. The boy tells his mother and sweetheart of his wrong doing and leaves the house, determined to shoot himself. Just as he is leveling the pistol to his temple Hughes, who has won back the boy's money, stays his hand and gives him the amount he had lost. Hurrying to his home the boy tells his mother and sweetheart the joyful news, while the old gambler looks in the window once more upon the face of the woman he loves and then passes out of her life forever.

Bill is a sailor at the London docks and is a very steady young ...	'Arriet Rogers, the daughter of a retired costermonger, Tom Rogers, has two very ardent suitors, Bill Larkin and Bob 'Armon. Bill is a sailor at the London docks and is a very steady young fellow. Bob, on the other hand, is not nearly so steady, but makes a lot of money betting on horses. In this way, by helping him rake in several good pots. Bob curries favor with old man Rogers, who promises him that he shall wed his daughter, 'Arriet. They are married in great style and look regular toffs on their wedding day, driving down Whitechapel in grand style. Bill is abroad in his ship and does not hear of the wedding until long afterwards. Luck is fickle and soon turns against Bob 'Armon, who loses not only all his own money, but all the savings of his father-in-law. Then he takes to drinking heavily and badly ill-treats his wife, who is about to present him with an heir. His drunken and thriftless habits are such that old man Rogers soon dies of a broken heart, leaving 'Arriet in the sole care of her now utterly brutal husband. Even after the birth of 'Arriet's baby, Bob continues his downward career. After a drunken row in a public house, in which he severely wounds a pot companion, he is obliged to flee the country and leaves his wife utterly penniless. 'Arriet has now no means of supporting herself and the baby and is reduced to such straits that she is obliged to beg in the streets, to save herself from starvation. One day, when soliciting alms in a public house, she meets Bill Larkin, who has just returned from a long voyage.

John Brown, his wife, two sons, Harold and Billy, and a young sister named Helen, has settled on an isolated plantation in the Jungles. Jack Arden, son of another English planter, who comes over frequently to hunt with the boys has fallen in love with Helen. But Papa Brown discourages the lovers, saying that Helen is too young to be married. Jack agrees to wait. Some time afterward the Browns receive a letter from Jack stating that he is coming for another week-end of shooting- with the Brown boys. On his way to the Brown's home, Jack knocks down Concho, an overseer, for being cruel to one of the slaves. His action is approved of by the Browns. In honor of Jack the family starts on a lion hunt, and, after a long trip, they return by the river route. They espy a lioness drinking at the river's edge. She is killed by Jack and taken aboard. That night Jack again asks Mr. Brown for Helen's hand and is again told to wait. The next day when Jack is going away, Helen, unknown to anyone else, accompanies him a little way into the jungle. Concho sees this and follows, until he sees them part. On the way home Helen dismounts and starts to pick some wild flowers until her attention is attracted by a lion cub. She ties her horse to a tree and trails the cub. She is followed and accosted by Concho. At the moment when she seems to be at the complete mercy of this half-breed brute, a leopard leaps from the undergrowth and attacks the villainous overseer. While the half-breed fights desperately with the ferocious beast. Helen makes her escape. She manages to make her way back to the spot where she left her horse, but, discovers a huge lion devouring the mangled remains of her mount. Terror-stricken she runs aimlessly into the jungle where she is soon followed by the lion and its mate. Concho, in the meantime, has managed to escape from the leopard. He crawls back to the plantation and accounts for his wounds by maliciously declaring that Jack Arden had abducted Helen and made off with her. Brown and boys start off in pursuit of the alleged kidnapper. The posse overtakes Jack only to discover they have been tricked by the malicious half-breed. The mystery of Helen's disappearance is still unsolved and Jack, beside himself with lover's grief, returns with the party to organize a searching expedition. In the meantime Helen has been chased to the banks of a river by the frenzied lions. In her fright she falls from a cliff into the stream below. She swims through the turbulent waters to the opposite bank and once more rushes into the dense brush. The maddened lions follow her through the water toward the opposite shore. The searching party is coming down the river at this time on rafts. Jack Arden's raft rounds a bend in the stream just in time for him to see the lions plunge into a thicket. Simultaneously he hears a scream and realizes that it emanates from Helen who lies at the mercy of the beasts. His rifle springs to his shoulder and two shots ring forth. The shots are guided straight to their mark by the unerring aim of true love and Helen is saved just before her life is crushed out by one of the wild beasts. When Jack reaches her side the huge lion is actually found dead and is lying over her body. Helen has sustained but slight wounds, and the clasp of Arden brings her back to life.

His sweetheart, Madge, often visited him while at work in the mountains, but never completely sympathized with his work. She wanted his whole love and attention. Bill Hogan was much beloved by pretty Carrie, but he, being also in love with Madge, ignored her. Bill felt that Jim's ability to paint was what had won Madge's heart. In a cozy part of the canyon lived charming Pauline, commonly called "The Angel of the Canyon," because of her many good deeds for the villagers. One morning she saw the artist at work with pretty Madge gazing petulantly at his canvas. She saw them quarrel, Madge fly toward the house, and Jim turn angrily toward his work. Then she stepped close beside him and he, thinking it Madge, took up her hand and kissed it, without looking up from his work. Even an angel can have human feeling, and the angel in this case found a special delight in the unexpected kiss. When Jim, in confusion, apologized, it seemed a desecration. But Madge, watching from a distance, thought otherwise. Several days later the angel, walking in the direction of the artist's glen, found and took away his canvas. Three weeks later he called upon her and found a check for $100 awaiting him and a brand new box for his equipment. Delighted, he showed his treasures to Madge, who only pouted and then cried. Meanwhile, Bill Hogan nursed a grudge in secret. A day came when the angel, strolling through the woods, saw a terrible fist fight between Bill Hogan and Jim. Beside them stood Madge and Carrie, vainly trying to separate then. Then came the angel's moment of renunciation. She had grown to love him and had to fight herself to repress the desire to go away. But her better nature conquered. She separated the combatants, gave Jim to Madge and pacified the troubled Bill. She strolled with Bill into the forest and when she returned, he went willingly to the happy Carrie.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:36:49.070000000

Her father is all attention to the rich fellow. The girl puts a record into the phonograph and she and her sweetheart sit back in the shadows as "Annie Laurie" is played. The father's face softens; he sees himself a young man courting his sweetheart back in the early sixties. The Civil War breaks: he goes off in a Union uniform, carrying a knot of ribbon from the girl, and the last thing he remembers is her voice singing the old familiar "Annie Laurie." He is wounded and taken to the house of a Southern girl who cares for him and sends for the Northern girl and her father. When they arrive he does not know them, until the girl, inspired by a sudden thought, kneels at his bedside and sings "Annie Laurie" to him. Then he remembers and they are soon in close embrace. At this point in his dream the old man awakens. The phonograph is still playing "Annie Laurie." The young lovers, in their dim corner, are oblivious to all but themselves. Remembering the days of his own romance, the father suggests to the rich suitor that they leave the young pair alone.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:36:53.070000000

Austin merely left his wife sitting alone; he made no effort to introduce her and showed his neglect plainly to the guests about the club grounds. Austin, on the links, tiring of the game, met Jennie Wilton, a widow. They strolled throughout the grounds together and the wife of Austin grieved in her heart at the sight. Her mother, proud of the splendid match her ingenuity had made, watched proceedings carefully, drinking her wine on the great balcony and ever keeping an eye out for trouble. It came when Jack Stanton, bachelor, made a spectacular drive. The ball rolled three hundred yards away and stopped at the feet of the lonesome wife. Acquaintance ripened into friendship in an hour. Returning, after a stroll with the Wilton woman, Austin saw his wife talking with Stanton. Instantly there was a clash. Austin turned upon his wife and the dislike of years focused in a bitter speech. He went away after that with the Wilton girl and his lonesome wife, sitting alone, watched through a glass while Austin kissed her in a boat gliding through the tress toward the open lake. A few minutes later Austin made up his mind. Pulling in toward shore, he wrote a note and sent a boy to deliver it to his wife. Stanton, seeing it all, took the note from the servant, and himself carried it to the mother of Mrs. Austin. She read it, smiled, gazed out to sea and turned happily toward Jack Stanton.

Joe Stanton, a straggling artist, has been able by careful management to keep his younger brother, Ted in college. Ted is unappreciative and becomes so extravagant that Joe is sorely pressed for funds. One morning Joe reads the announcement of the Century Art Society that $10,000 in prizes will be given for the best studies of "The American Girl." He decides to compete, but is unable to secure a suitable model. Nell Winston, employed in a department store, resents the advances of an overbearing floorwalker and is discharged. As she sits in the park she attracts the attention of Joe, who has been strolling aimlessly and gloomily, thinking of the futility of entering the contest. He is struck by the girl s beauty and, introducing himself, induces her to act as his model. Nell agrees and visits the studio. As the days pass the old story repeats itself and the artist falls deeply in love with the girl. Holidays arrive and Ted dashes into the studio to be confronted by a beautiful stranger. He makes known his identity and learns that Nell is waiting for Joe. Ted prevails upon her to take a stroll and during the walk he discovers that he has found "the one girl." The days pass and the painting is completed. Joe is summoned before the art committee and awarded the first prize.

If they do not pay up promptly she is the one who goes to their place of employment and "bawls them out." Young Dick Lewis, a bank clerk, to help his fellow clerk. Jack Gray, borrows $200 of Charker & Co. The bawlerout is sent to his home to find out all about him. She pretends to be a book agent and talks with his mother, a kindly old gentlewoman. Satisfied that the boy is all he said, Charker & Co., advance him the money. Dick is engaged to Edith Downs, the pretty daughter of the bank cashier. She is a selfish, heartless girl, caring more for dress than she does for anything else. When Dick, owing to the fact that he has no evening clothes, finds himself unable to go to a ball with her, she calls his rival on the 'phone and makes an appointment to go with him, Dick's friend refuses to help Dick pay back the money he borrowed for his sake; so the bawlerout is sent to the bank to disgrace the boy. But as she begins she sees his mother entering with the bank president. The sight of the gentle old lady softens the girl and she goes away without accomplishing her purpose. John Howard, a reformer, disguises as a workman to find out the truth about the loan shark establishment. He interests the bawlerout and together they find out that President Bendis of the bank in which Dick is employed is the real head of Charker & Co. Edith's father, to keep up with his daughter's extravagance, borrows money from the bank which he is unable to repay. The girl, learning of this and dreading to see her father disgraced, suggests that as Dick loves her, he take the blame. The boy agrees. Miss Sullivan, who has become friendly with Dick's mother, is a constant visitor at the house. But she has never permitted herself to soften toward Dick, who, despite this and the fact of his engagement to Edith, falls in love with the erstwhile bawlerout. Howard and Miss Sullivan secure the necessary evidence against Charker's. In the bank the money is missed and Dick accused. He says nothing and is about to be arrested when Howard enters with the bawlerout. Bendis is told that he is wanted by the police and Miss Sullivan, seeing Dick handcuffed, asks the reason and is told. One glance from the boy to the shrinking cashier convinces her as to just who the thief is. She "bawls out" Downs and breaks him so that he readily confesses. As he and Bendis are taken away, Edith turns to Dick and informs him that she is done with him, she has become engaged to the other man. With a great sigh of relief, Dick holds out his arms to Miss Sullivan, and she, despite her past coldness, enters his embrace. And it is thus that Dick's mother finds them a little later.

Morgan offers to throw the Aqueduct Contract in his way if he will influence his young daughter, Nell, to marry him. Bascom agrees, but later finds that Nell has engaged herself to Dick, a young reporter, and will have nothing to do with the boss. Morgan, furious, tells Bascom that now he will be ruined, indeed. By accident, Dick wanders into an East Side saloon where, in a private room, the boss meets his constituents. Dick overhears Morgan telling Hart, contractor, to meet him in the saloon at nine sharp as he is going to open all bids submitted so that Hart may make his lower than the others. Dick rushes back to his editor and tells him that he can secure a great graft story, but how. They hit upon the dictagraph. Dick plants it in the saloon and that night at nine is busy in a little upstairs room with the receiver at his ear busily jotting down notes. Nell is with him. The bids are brought to the boss by the commissioner's clerk, one of his henchmen. Bascom's bid is discovered to be the lowest of all and just as Hart is about to reduce his, the dictagraph wires are discovered and the boss dashes upstairs. Jumping upon Dick, he almost kills him when Bascom enters and saves the young chap's life. He takes the two young folks home and Dick is preparing his article for the press when the boss, who has experienced a change of heart, enters and tells Bascom that his bid will get the contract. Nell thanks him and Dick, for her sake flings his "graft scandal" story into the fire.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:38:06.770000000

Hamilton takes pathetic leave of his daughter, Edna, and his young son, James, and goes to the front to fight for the Southern cause. The opposing armies are seen in thrilling battles. One day Capt. Blake receives orders to go on a foraging expedition, and arrives at the Hamilton home. The soldiers make short work of the chicken coop, Don, little Jimmie's pet horse, is taken. The old Negro servant puts up a stubborn fight to save his young master's pet, but is knocked down by a soldier. Further punishment Is prevented by Capt. Blake, who arrives upon the scene. Jimmie rushes to the captain and begs and pleads for his horse. The tenderhearted young officer is touched by the tears and grief of the boy, and finally gives him back the animal. Edna sees Capt. Blake about to take a drink at the well and, nerved by her hatred of the North, rushes out and dashes the shell from his hands. Amused by the little spitfire, Blake solemnly bows and says: "In the North our men are gentlemen, and the women, ladies," and walks away, Edna, ashamed of her conduct, battles with her emotions for a few moments, and calls the Captain back, offering him a drink with her own fair hands. After his departure, Edna learns of his kindness in saving Jimmie's horse, and the captain did not suspect the impression he had made on her heart. Some time later the Union Army is in desperate straits, being attacked by a heavy force. The troops tight against tremendous odds, refusing to surrender, and Capt. Blake volunteers to pierce the enemy's lines and deliver a message to the Union general commanding the other wing to come to the rescue by consolidating the forces. Blake makes a thrilling ride, pursued by Confederate soldiers, who shoot his horse and wound him. Weak and staggering, he finds himself near the Hamilton home and drags himself to the door, Edna and Jimmie do everything in their power to make him comfortable, and he is saved from capture by a clever trick, blacking his face and hands and putting him in the Negro quarters. The pursuing soldiers are told by old Mammy that he is her son who has been shot by the man they are searching for. The booming cannon in the distance greatly distress Blake, who realizes the predicament of his comrades. In desperation, he asks Jimmie to do him a favor and makes him promise on his word of honor not to tell any one. The grateful boy is staggered by the request Jim makes, of riding to the Northern general with the message, and refuses at first, but in splendid dissolving scenes visions of his pet being restored to him are seen, and he agrees. The boy makes a daring ride, and the Union forces are saved. The Confederates are driven back through the town, and Col. Hamilton, to save himself from capture runs into the Negro cabin, where he is astounded to find his daughter and a Northern officer. In an instant his gun is in his hand, but he is stopped by Edna, who explains the situation. The pursuing Northern soldiers arrive at the door and Blake hides Hamilton behind the bed, and informs the soldiers that no one is there. He rejoins his command, and rides away. After the war is over Blake comes back to the Hamilton home and is joyfully received by Edna.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-11 00:28:50.807000000

Through the persuasions of a friend, Hal begins to frequent a questionable pool room. His brother, Paul, a cleric, warns him against his evil associates, but Hal disregards Paul's counsels. In a short time he begins to play for money. He gets into a game with a young man, who unknown to him, is a notorious counterfeiter, one of a gang whose headquarters are under the pool room, and of which the pool room proprietor is a member. In settling the stakes, Hal is handed a couple of crisp new bills. One of these he unwittedly passes on a local merchant. In the meantime, a detective has been on the trail of the counterfeiters and has begun to suspect Hal. When the merchant shows him the "queer" and describes the man who "shoved" it on him, the detective begins a search for Hal. The latter is warned by a pal and goes to his brother Paul for counsel. Paul persuades Hal to let him (Paul) takes Hal's place. Accordingly, the brothers (who are twins) exchange vestures. Hal donning Paul's clerical raiment and Paul assuming his brother's layman's attire. The detective arrives and arrests Paul, who is subsequently convicted and committed to prison, while Hal attempts to carry on his brother's work. In the course of his itinerant preaching he strikes upon a clue which leads to the discovery and capture of the counterfeiters. In the gun play which takes place between the police and the criminals, the young counterfeiter is fatally wounded. Hal persuades him to confess. Paul is now pardoned and resumes his missionary work. The closing scenes show Paul preaching to a crowd, with Hal and his family in attendance.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:39:12.507000000

A promising young physician has an inherent weakness for drink. He is devoted to his wife and child. At one fell swoop, diphtheria takes from him both wife and child. He loses his nerve yields himself up completely to liquor, loses his practice, his friends and his self-respect. He finally arrives at the bottom of the ladder where weakened and penniless, he falls in with a gang of yeggs and is persuaded to undertake a burglary. He spots the Harrison home, observes that Mrs. Harrison has been left alone this particular night and enters by the upper balcony, first cutting the 'phone wires. He comes face to face with the mother endeavoring to save her child from dying in a violent fit of sickness which has attacked it. She can't get the doctor on the "dead" 'phone, and dares not leave the child to summon help. The burglar throws aside the rich haul of jewels he has just pocketed, trusts his fate in the hands of the woman, and works over the child with all his old professional skill. He robs death of the child. A night watchman discovers the severed 'phone wires, becomes suspicious and commences an investigation. The way in which the grateful mother shields the burglar as the latter labors over her little one, and the effect which the good woman's faith has on the unfortunate man, form the intensely sympathetic conclusion of the story.

She had read many books and from them had gained the idea that she would be far happier as a simple peasant than as the daughter of a king. Even when it came to her marriage, she sadly reflected, there was no romance, for her father had arbitrarily contracted an alliance for her with a neighboring prince. The princess was taking her drive one day and was sadder than ever. She saw a wedding procession issue from a neighboring cottage, and pityingly watched the mother of the bride, as she turned into her lonely house. In a field the princess noticed a young farmer, and she thought that the romance which had been denied her might come into her life. By the time she had returned to the castle she was pitying herself exceedingly, and had decided to be a caged bird no longer. The princess secured a peasant's gown, and, well supplied with money, stole away from the palace, as she thought, forever. Before going she opened the cage of her pet canary and watched him fly away happy at his new found liberty. In the life outside the castle the princess found she was handicapped by her ignorance. She gave alms to a crippled man, and he scandalized the community by spending it in riotous living. She met the young farmer and he horrified her by roughly kissing her. She procured a home with the mother of the bride and her money was stolen by that depraved old woman. Disillusioned, the princess returned to her castle. Just outside its gates she came upon the little bird she had set at liberty. It, too, had found itself unfitted for an adventurous life. Strange, fierce birds bad attacked it, and the little canary was feebly trying to return to the castle, when its mistress came along. The bird was glad to be placed in its gilded cage again. The princess was glad to return to her old life, marry, the prince, who was really a very decent young chap, and retain the place which her birth and breeding entitled her to fill.

Three miles away Rattlesnake Pete, by way of diversion, soundly and thoroughly beat Mrs. Rattlesnake Pete and took away his ferocious pal to the cache where the stolen money was hidden. Simultaneously, the sheriff posted up a $500 reward notice for the same pair and aroused the cupidity of "Know-it-All Jones," who, revolver in hand, went in search of that five hundred. Now it fell out that Calamity, seeing the notice, also needed cash; so when a suspicious character appeared, hiked him toward the sheriff at the point of her gun. Alas! The sheriff dismissed her with the remark that a harmless old tramp was a poor excuse. So Calamity, in disgust left. Later she fell upon the real bandit and so knocked the wind out of the husky body of Rattlesnake Pete that the desperado in panic fled down the road. His Pal also fled straight into the arms of Know-It-All Jones, who promptly helped him along toward the sheriff. Then Calamity, overhauling her victim again fell upon him with such frightful effect that the poor wretch fled straight into the sheriff's arms for protection. And then, horror of horrors, the sheriff refused the reward on the ground that the bandit had given himself up - and, to make matters worse, Calamity beheld "Know-It-All Jones" collect his change and depart. Heart-sick Calamity left and shortly after with only Calamity's luck, fell straight upon the cache wherein was hidden the dough. With this Calamity, in righteous indignation, decided to vamoose, but on the way, leading her burro, came upon the house of Rattlesnake Pete and there saw his weeping and poverty-stricken wife. Calamity's tender heart gave way. She hauled the bags of dust from her bosom and presented them to the unfortunate wife, leaving, with a light heart and a heavy laden burro, for parts unknown.

While making preparations for the entertainment of Aunt Maria, who bad announced her arrival by telegram, Lila Lane gets herself shut in the storeroom, which is fitted with a spring loot. Here she is found later by her sweetheart, Harry Eschert, who has returned for some forgotten papers. Harry is a boarder with Mrs. Lane, who at this moment is out for a drive with her husband. Anita, Lila's sister, is also out in an auto with her beau, Fred Brockway. In the morning Harry and Lila have had a severe tiff. Judge their horror, then, when the door slams on them and they find themselves locked in together. Harry has left the door open on entering the house and this fact is noticed by Jack Wearyfoot, a tramp, who enters the house and helps himself to the dinner. Aunt Maria presently arrives and is surprised at seeing no one about, for the tramp quickly hides himself behind a trunk. Soon she hears the noise made by Harry and Lila, who are pounding the door. Going upstairs, she is still more surprised when she finds her niece shut in a room with a young man. While she is speaking her mind to them, the tramp slams the door on the three of them. Meanwhile, Fred and Anita have a spat and she tells him to take her home. They investigate the noise in the storeroom and. not heeding quickly enough Harry's warning about the door, get shut in also. The room becomes decidedly cool as there are two couples in it, neither of whom will speak to each other, while Aunt Maria gazes frigidly on all. Presently the young folks realize the humor of the situation and are soon in each other's arms, to the horror of the spinster aunt. They are all released later by Mr. and Mrs. Lane, who take care not to get shut in and sit down to a big dinner to celebrate the two engagements that are announced.

Tom blew in his little stake before leaving, and arrived out West broke and discouraged. There he fell in with two crooks and with them laid plans to hold up the pay wagon of the construction camp. Meanwhile, a hobo got off a freight and strolled to the camp in search of work. He needed only a chance to reform. He watched the men place a stick of dynamite and leave, and too late, saw Tom, crouched down in the danger zone, gun in hand, waiting for the pay wagon. There was a terrific explosion and Tom died. Hurrying to the scene, the hobo donned Tom's clothes and papers, secured work, took Tom's name and prospered. Worrying over the absence of her intended, Mabel and her father visited the construction camp. They asked for Tom and his namesake, now clean shaven, handsome and prosperous-looking, responded. There were explanations and a visit to the grave. "With him I buried my failures," said the other. In the days that followed, Mabel found she still wanted the name of Tom, and eventually married him.

Several times Jack Hardy almost reaches the proposal point with Marion Van Sickles, but each time the fates are against him. Marion and her mother are on their way home from a vacation in Europe and board the boat at Liverpool at the same time as Jack, who is very much struck by Marion's appearance. After a little flirtation on the boat, he believes that his feelings are returned and is about to propose. Just then mama comes along with Count Brainlesse, whom she wishes to marry Marion. The proposal is postponed. Again and again Jack tries to come to the point, being constantly interrupted by someone, either the count or mama, or the grouchy owner of the deck chair he has taken. First the grouch, then mama, and then the count, get sea-sick and at last Jack has Marion alone. Alas, the time has not yet come. Jack himself is suddenly seized with sickness and has to rush away just as the words tremble on his lips. The remainder of the voyage is spent by Jack in his bunk, from which he is too ill to rise. The steamer docks early in the morning before the steward has visited him and he does not wake himself until everyone is ready to leave the ship's side. He rushes to the deck, clad in nothing but his pajamas, Marion is with the count and her mother is nearby. It is obvious that the count is proposing marriage, but before he can place the ring on Marion's finger, Jack pushes in front of him, and falling on his knees, proposes to her in full view of everyone on deck. Marion joyfully goes to his arms and together they turn to pacify her scandalized mother and make the necessary explanations to the onlookers.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-11 00:41:30.960000000

Don Arguello, in order to get the fortune of his ward, Princess Irma, insists that she marry him. The high-spirited girl repulses him as equally unworthy of love or respect, but temporizes with him. About this time Captain Falconbridge, of the U. S. Cavalry, who is stationed at the Mexican border, is introduced to Irma at Don Arguello's home by Don Carlos, a high-grade young Mexican, who consorts with Americans. At a later visit Don Arguello happens on the scene and shows his immediate disapproval by insulting the American flag which Falconbridge has presented to Irma. This so incenses the soldier that he requests the ladies to leave the room while he gives the old roué a sound trouncing. He has completed this in satisfactory fashion, the furniture being wrecked in the struggle, when a detachment of Mexican soldiers arrive. Falconbridge escapes the vengeance of the reinforcements by leaping through a window. Irma, who is waiting the outcome of the fight in the garden, decides to fly over the border with the American and escape her vengeful and despised guardian. Don Carlos admires Irma, but unselfishly gives aid to this good cause. Close to the border the fleeing pair are forced to take refuge in an adobe. There they "stand off" the pursuing greasers until the boys of Falconbridge's command, hearing the firing, and scenting trouble, ride over the border and make a daring rescue.

They walk about a block and then Joe discovering Chester's overcoat, they return. Chester meanwhile has been impatiently waiting Flossie's return. She enters with Joe and he gets the right overcoat. He leaves, this time alone. Chester proposes to Flossie, is accepted, and he gives her a ring. The next day she is out walking with him. Chester goes across the street to mail a letter and Joe passes in his auto. She calls him and they ride away together, forgetting completely that Chester ever existed. Joe, after taking her home, proposes to her and she accepts. He goes to put a ring on her finger when he notices the other. Chester enters at that moment and explains to Joe's chagrin, that the forgetful girl is his promised bride. They go to the minister and are married. She forgets who she is married to and kisses the minister, much to that reverend gentleman's consternation. However, Chester determines that he can cure her of her forgetfulness and all ends well.

The evening of the dance, Mrs. Moore tells them that she and her husband will be away for the night, staying at her mother's, and gives the key to Mrs. Burton so that she and her husband will have no trouble getting into the house when they return. As soon as the Moores and Burtons have driven away to keep their respective engagements, Maggie, the cook, also leaves the house; she is going to a wedding celebration and expects to be away all night and to return in the morning before her master and mistress get back. She tells the sleepy housemaid, Bridget, that she has the key in her pocket-book. When the Burtons get back from the dance they find that they have left the key behind. They ring and ring, but Bridget, who is a fat, sleepy individual, does not hear them. An attempt to enter the house by means of the cellar is futile. Burton does not have much trouble getting through the cellar window but is unable to get through the door that leads into the kitchen, as it is locked. He succeeds, however, in knocking over an ash barrel and getting his clothes badly messed. The Burtons then attempt to rouse the maid by telephoning to the house, but she still sleeps soundly and does not hear them. Incidentally it costs two dollars to appease the sleepy druggist for bringing him out of bed. They next decide to go to a hotel, but the clerk will not admit them as they have no baggage. The rest of the night they spend in a taxi-cab as it is too chilly to walk about the streets. About eight o'clock in the morning, Maggie returns from the wedding party and sees the taxi in front of the house. Maggie looks inside, and seeing the sleepers, becomes alarmed and shrieks out that they are dead. Her screams awake Mr. and Mrs. Burton, who joyfully recognize her and get the key at last. Not the least of their troubles is that the taxi meter has been piling up the bill steadily and Burton finds that he has about seventeen dollars to pay for what has been, at the best, an uncomfortable lodging house.

Over the mountains they galloped madly, the fugitive running almost in a circle. In front of the cabin sat Grace Merriwell, the sheriff's sweetheart, when suddenly before her stood the hunted one. Instantly she recognized her brother and secreted him in the house. The sheriff, tracking his man unfailingly, stopped at the cabin. He entered and the excited girl made known her brother's presence in the house. The sheriff hesitated. It was love or duty and the sheriff chose love. Taking the fugitive by the hand he made him secrete himself in another room. The posse entered and all felt satisfied with the sheriff's word but Higgins. He, suspicious, went from room to room and with lightning-like rapidity the hunted man changed his hiding place. When they had all gone, the sheriff bowed his head. Taking the star from his breast he threw it on the table for he knew that his day was over. Between love and duty he had chose love.	English	USA	N/A	2014-03-25 02:18:06.537000000

They fall asleep and dream of their past life. Their dreams carry them from boy and girlhood all through life to this day, greatest of all, their golden wedding. Their first meeting shows them, at the age of five, on their way to school, and even then, as young as they are, the seed of love is sown. A few years and we see them growing past the school age. Next we see the youth proposing and being accepted: the happiest moment of their lives, their first-born baby. War between the North and South breaks out and the youth is called to fight for his side, the South. As he goes away he puts the picture of his wife in his pocket next to his heart. Daily letters are written from the front telling of the war and the little wife anxiously waits for the next one to come, but one day none arrives, then another day. Something must be wrong. At the front the boy is wounded, and if it had not been for the tintype in his pocket, the bullet would have killed him instead of glancing off, only causing a broken arm. Home he comes to rest and to wait for his arm to heal. Happiness reigns once more in the little home. War is over and they live the quiet happy lives of country folk till we meet them again, asleep at the fireplace. His pipe drops. He awakens. It is time to go to bed. He lights the candle and the good wife calls in the cat and both, arm in arm, go upstairs to dream the dreams of their youth again.	English	USA	N/A	2014-05-30 01:59:05.840000000

After a quarrel Mabel imagines herself neglected, and listens to the honeyed words of a tempter, and finally agrees to elope 'with him. A boy is sent for a cab, and the innocent youth calls the husband. The vehicle drives up and the couple run into it, their identity unnoticed by the driver, and they absorbed in each other, not noting the man on the seat. Hubby glances into the mirror reflecting the interior of the cab, and the fun starts.

His disapproval is so marked that it is finally noticed by said swain, Tim Brown, when he is kicked out of the house by the father of his lady love, and he resolves to be careful in the future and not be subjected to further indignities. The Professor has been experimenting with germs, and discovers some new and deadly ones which he exhibits to some of his medical friends. The germs have been raised in a culture of milk, and when the professor escorts his guests to the door the milk bottle and the cup are left on the table. Unfortunately, Tim Brown seized this particular moment to make a call on his lady love, accompanied by his dog, making his entrance through an open window. The dog is thirsty, so he innocently pours more milk into the cup and gives it to the animal. The professor, returning, sees what is taking place, and crying, "The dog is full of deadly germs," runs away. The dog, attracted by the queerly acting, screaming man, runs after him, and soon there is tremendous excitement, half the town running with the Professor, and the others running after him and the dog. After many narrow escapes from the deadly teeth of the dog, the professor finally reaches a place of safety.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-10 00:16:41.760000000

That is to say Bessie loved an idol, a very perishable clay idol much addicted to the use of liquor. Shortly after their marriage, Bob came home reeling drunk. Bessie tried in vain to break him but, with the further use of the poison, Bob fell into evil ways, returned home but seldom and then only to maltreat and abuse her. A day came when Bessie could no longer stand the strain; so she packed her small belongings and dolefully went forth to seek new joys in new fields. Bob, coming home quite drunk, found the house locked and drifted away with the oddities of Fate. Tired, Bessie sat down upon a rock. Will Wayne, riding slowly down the road saw her, stopped and hearing her story took her home. Old man Wayne and Will's mother kept her for several weeks and Will grew to love her dearly. But independent Bessie though the time had come to leave and was only dissuaded by the urgent request of the whole family. Two years later, Bessie found the morning paper on the stoop. Its first page contained a story of a railroad wreck and among the slain was Bob. A year later Bessie married Will and the young couple moved to Will's new home and were happy. Riding through the mountains one day, Will came upon Bob Evans, very much alive, quite sick and quite dirty. Not knowing him he took him home. Between Bob and Bessie there was instant trouble. Will started to interfere and a scuffle followed. Will dropped dead with a bullet through him. The cowboys then found the slayer creeping through hills and ended a career that had wrecked the life and happiness of Bessie.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-26 00:16:02.727000000

Hearing that his nephew, Fred Nolan, is engaged to marry a widow, Uncle John Bunny sends for him and declares that if he does not give her up he will not get a cent of his uncle's money. Bunny's prejudice is simply against widows in general, as he has not met the lady in question, but none the less, he quite means what he says. Fred confides with his chum, Joe Tripp, and together they plan to put one over on the obstinate old gentleman. Tripp invites a crowd of people to a week-end party, among them John Bunny, and, unknown to him, also the widow. Bunny and the widow are thrown together, but he does not seem very susceptible to her charms. He is tired and sleepy and would much prefer taking a nap to talking with the most charming lady in existence. After a while, he gets away from her and tries to snatch forty winks in the conservatory. It is no use, the young folks soon drive him out of there. He tries the drawing-room and is again obliged to decamp. At last, in desperation, he goes upstairs, and entering the first bedroom he reaches, which happens to be the widow's, he throws himself down and at once enters the land of nod. Seeing him when she enters the room, the widow rushes off in consternation and calls to Fred and Joe to turn him out. An idea strikes them.

She decides to go out for a walk in the hope that something in the way of an adventure may come her way. Fred Hanley, a young man, has become a confirmed drunkard. A friend of his brings a doctor to visit Hanley. Hanley becomes excited during their visit and frightens them nearly unto death by shooting at them with a revolver. They leave in haste, but decide to lock Hanley in his room. This they do, leaving a servant to watch the door. Hanley, crazed for want of drink, writes a note that he is wrongfully imprisoned, and offers $5,000 reward for anyone who liberates him. This he throws out the window, just as Pearl is passing the house. She picks it up, reads it and realizes that her quest for an adventure has borne fruit. She immediately goes home and disguises as a boy. Coming back, she applies for a job and the woman downstairs employs her and puts the supposed boy to work. Pearl has a hard time of it, peeling potatoes and scrubbing floors, but with never a chance to liberate the unfortunate, supposed prisoner. Later, however, she is caught upstairs listening at the door by the servant, and is kicked downstairs. The woman pulls her ears for leaving the kitchen, and all in all, Pearl is treated exactly how a real detective should not be. However, at last, Pearl succeeds in gaining access to the room and is fondly dreaming of the five thousand dollar reward and her noble work and bravery, when Hanley's friends enter and explain. Pearl appreciates that she has been stung and beats a hasty retreat, resolving to detect in a more profitable way in the hereafter.	English	USA	N/A	2014-09-08 00:19:13.883000000

Willie and Hank were entered in the race for Katy's affection. Katy was the sheriff's daughter. Willie was the "pet aversion" of Hank, whom the sheriff thought to be a proper husband for Katy. One night, when the sheriff wasn't looking, Katy did elope with Willie, almost. General excitement prevailed in Jayville Center. Newspaper rumors had it that right there in Jayville, counterfeiters were at work on spurious coin. Impossible! The only one in the town who believed this was Hank, and he kept a close lookout for suspicious characters. Hank happened across Willie and often made Willie mad. Willie proved this more than once with his left foot. In Hank's mind, suspicion pointed her index finger in the direction of Willie. When Willie was eloping with Katy, Hank hurried to the sheriff and informed him of his daughter's flight with a counterfeiter. The sheriff and a posse pursued. The elopers sought refuge in a deserted house, which proved to be the real counterfeiters' den. There was a real fight, and a tie up in the wedding business for a while, but Willie won out. The sheriff and his posse arrived. In the glory of his capture of the counterfeiters the sheriff was won over by Willie.				2013-11-20 00:00:00

Vincenza greatly admires the moustache of her new neighbor and speaks of this to her husband, who laughs at her scornfully, but becomes very jealous of the man, Biaggio. Later in the day, when Vincenza is coming home with the groceries, she meets Biaggio on the steps of the house, and speaks to him for a few moments. Angelica, the wife of Biaggio, is looking out of the window and sees her husband talking with this strange woman, and she, in turn, also becomes jealous.

There is quite a lively time in both apartments as a result of the little meeting on the doorstep. Owing to his hasty temper, Luigi loses his job and is unable to find another.

Fred Wentworth, one of the clerks, is sent out on a message, and while he is gone the cashier is shot dead by Frank Davis, a robber and bad man ...	The story opens in a bank in Minneapolis. Fred Wentworth, one of the clerks, is sent out on a message, and while he is gone the cashier is shot dead by Frank Davis, a robber and bad man generally. Davis secures a package of bank notes and hurriedly departs. On his way to the street he runs into Fred Wentworth (who is returning to the bank) with such force that he drops the package. He recognizes Wentworth and, fearful of arrest, rushes away and catches a northbound train that is just pulling out. Wentworth stops amazed and lifts the package. Entering the bank, he discovers the dead cashier and a revolver on the floor. Horrified, he lifts the revolver, and while holding it and the package of bills in his hands the president of the bank enters. The proofs of murder are so clear that Wentworth is sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary. Frank Davis, in the meantime, has gone to one of his old haunts in the North, near the boundary line. He induces one of his former associates to join him in whiskey-running across the border. While the men are engaged in this outlawry, Fred Wentworth escapes from prison and heads for the Northwest. He is saved from death in the snowdrifts by an officer of the mounted police, who carries him to headquarters. After his recovery he applies to the chief for admission to the force, and is accepted as a member. The president of the Minneapolis bank, a brother of the chief of the N. W. M. P., chances to arrive at the post on a visit about, the time that Wentworth is about to leave on a search for the whiskey smugglers. The president catches a side glimpse of Wentworth's face as he rides off, and tries to recall it. He fails, but it still haunts him, and the truth flashes on him some time after Wentworth's departure. He immediately denounces Wentworth as an escaped murderer, and the chief dispatches two of his men to arrest that officer. Wentworth, in the interim, has discovered the smugglers, and is badly worsted in an encounter with Davis, whom he recognizes as the murderer of the cashier. The two officers arrive at the spot shortly after the struggle, and Davis opens fire on them. They mortally wound him and he is carried into the cabin, where they arrest Wentworth. Davis, after confessing that he killed the cashier, and that Wentworth is innocent, dies. Wentworth is taken back to the post and is cleared of the crime in presence of the chief and his brother. He is then restored to his former position in the Minneapolis bank.	English	USA	N/A	2014-08-14 00:20:14.880000000

Pretty Claudine often went forth to visit the traps with him and one day, when no bound, they saw a youth kiss a maiden affectionately. Seeing a chance for an object lesson, the old trapper sagely shook his head, saying, "My child, such kisses are poison. Guard against them." Claudine had a herd of goats which she tends carefully, and one say, sitting one a rock with them scampering about her, she made so pretty a picture that Ralph Walters, a young artist from the city, asked her to pose for him. They arranged an engagement for the following day. He posed her prettily and then, overcome by her beauty, impulsively kissed her upturned, inquiring lips. Claudine fled in shame. From a distance she watched him, debating her father's advice. Then, plucking a handful of poisoned berries, she went again to him. He ate them gladly. In a few moments he fell, deathly sick, across the rock and Claudine ran, badly scared to her father. Together they rescued the sick artist, and took him home. He recovered, and one day, while away with her father, she told him her reason for giving him the poisoned berries. Furious at the insult offered his daughter, the aged trapper hurried back, gave Ralph a gun, and offered him a chance for his life. Overcome by feeling, Claudine stepped in between them and spared Ralph from the deadly hatred of the old man. A few minutes later Ralph was picking his way through the boulders, pondering upon the quaintness of backwoods ways and the ease with which an innocent expression of admiration was transformed into an excuse to kill.

Ruth, the daughter of the ranch owner, one day sees Dakota's display of horsemanship, and the admiration thus aroused soon ripens into love, much against the protest of the family. Ruth's love for Dakota is increased by his heroic deed when he rescues her from the malignant attentions of a rushing steer whose anger is aroused by the flowing red handkerchief about her neck. Dakota, who is riding ahead of the cowboys on a round-up expedition, catches sight of the steer heading for Ruth, and, spurring his broncho into a break-neck speed, reaches the side of the steer, leaps upon its hack, and, fastening his muscular arms on the frenzied beast's horns, brings him to the ground. In the midst of the ovation given him by the cowboys, Dakota is nabbed by Sheriff Mathers, who begins to march him back to the Deer Lodge Penitentiary. As the sheriff, his deputies and his captive are riding along a narrow mountain roadway, Dakota makes a daring leap down the precipitous incline, rolling down until he reaches the bottom, where he hides behind a projecting rock. The sheriff, in the meantime, has taken the long way down and follows for a distance, until he discovers the still form of Dakota behind the sheltering rock, and, thinking him dead, rides away. Though free, Dakota is handicapped by the manacles. He manages to steal the gun and horse belonging to a sleeping shepherd, and by holding the gun between his knees, and placing the connecting chain of the manacles in front of the gun, he pulls with his teeth the strap which he has fastened to the trigger of the gun, thereby severing the connecting links. As he starts to ride away he is observed by a distant rifleman, who, by the aid of binoculars, sees the dangling steel wristlets, proving that he is an outlaw. He fires and Dakota tails from his horse with a head wound. But his left foot gets caught in the stirrup and he is dragged for a long distance with bullets flying around him. His foot eventually gets loose and he is left unconscious on the ground. When he regains consciousness, he finds himself again in the hands of the law, and just before he is about to be incarcerated he marries Ruth Watson, who bravely sobs as he is led away: "Good bye, my man, when you come back, I'll be waiting."

Not being impressed with their looks he spies upon them and discovers that they are making bombs. Securing a pistol he rushes into the room and chases them out. He then runs to the police station, but is kicked out by the cops who resent leaving their game of pinochle interfered with. The revengeful Italians enter the landlord's home while his wife has gone to the store and place their baby in a basket, which they attach to the end of a long spring, taken from an exerciser, and fasten the other end of the spring under the window so that when the window is raised it will permit the basket to fall four stories. The landlord is waylaid and tied to a fence, his gloating captors telling him of what they have done. He is in agony and tugs at his bonds, and manages to get the rope in his mouth, which he vainly tries to chew in two. His wife returns home and missing the baby, thinks he has taken it out. Alternate flashes are shown of the woman In the house and the baby dangling at the end of the spring, and the audience is kept in an expectant frame by the wife going to the window to open it and having her attention distracted by various incidents in time to prevent her from raising the window. A boy finally releases the frantic landlord, who rushes home just in time to save his child.	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-29 00:00:21.743000000

The father, Lord Harcourt, avoids the little fellow, who is a constant reminder of the woman whose life went out when the long hoped for son came. The art gallery where a full-length oil painting of the sweet-faced woman hangs, is the little boy's favorite resting place. Raymond gazes on the face, and he fancies that his mother smiles at him. Then in a fantasy he sees his mother step out of the frame. They hold sweet communion, and the boy feels that he is no longer alone. They play and romp over the lawn. The fantasy continues: his mother hears his evening prayer, he kneels by her side and repeats the words she has taught him. She lays him in his little bed and tells him stories till the "sand man" comes to claim him. Then he awakens from his day-dream, and only the sweet figure on the canvas remains. He is sobbing out his disappointment against the unresponsive painting, when a sweet young woman that Lord Harcourt has asked to be his wife, comes upon the motherless boy, and hears his impassioned appeal to his mother to return to him. Her whole heart responds to the child and she takes him in her arms. Lord Harcourt, missing his fiancée, hurries to the picture gallery in search of her and sees the tender scene. The man has never before realized the heart hunger of the motherless boy, and the woman, soon to be his wife, shows him how the child has suffered for a parent's love. Harcourt's conscience reproves him; he tries to atone to the boy, who responds eagerly, and finds happiness at last in the tender arms of his new mother, and in the long denied companionship of his father.

The engagement is announced. Tom Trude, the brother of Mabel, is a sort of shiftless fellow and is exceedingly unlucky at cards. It required but little argument on the part of the acknowledged best man of the community to win Tom over to his gang, as he hopes to make good his losses at cards in some manner other than actual labor. The post office is held up and the sheriff called upon to bring the perpetrators to justice. A lively encounter is followed by the escape and pursuit of one of the men. The sheriff himself takes up the chase and successfully runs down the man. To his consternation, it proves to be Mabel's brother. He passes their home with the prisoner in tow. Mabel argues and pleads, but to no avail, and she finally plays her largest card--her love, against her brother's liberty. The mental struggle of the sheriff is intense, but he wins, and as he pockets the engagement ring returned to him by Mabel, he marches his prisoner off to jail.

Smith is an elderly man who impetuously sweeps everything before him, and his dashing ways win Mabel's heart. Poor Jones is downcast when he learns that Mabel is to marry Smith, and follows Smith home. He learns that Smith is already married and has ten little children. Peering through the window he sees the terror-stricken family bullied by Smith. Smith and Mabel go to the minister's house to be married, and Jones, dogging their footsteps, attempts to interfere but is driven away by Smith. Jones has an idea, and rushing to the Smith home he tells Mrs. Smith that her husband is marrying another girl. She grabs two arms full of little ones, and with the rest toddling at her heels she arrives in time to prevent the wedding. Smith and his wife and the kids go home, and Jones gets the gin. In revenge, Smith captures Mabel and carries her to the old saw mill. Tying her on a board he awaits the moment when the saw shall cut her in two. Jones tries to rescue her but is driven away by Smith. Jones telephones the police, who have many exciting adventures before they reach the spot. In despair, Jones holds back the big fly wheel. It lifts him off his feet and he revolves rapidly around, but he finally masters it and holds it back. In a laughable melodramatic manner the doors are broken down and the heroine is rescued "in the nick of time."	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-24 00:54:15.203000000

When Mercy Merrick left the refuge in London, where she had heard words of comfort that put her again on the right path, she thought she had turned her back forever on the old life and all that might remind her of it. From the refuge she had gone to South Africa as a nurse during the war and while there met Grace Rosebury, the daughter of General Rosebury, who had come for temporary shelter to one of the field hospitals. The general's daughter was wet and cold. Mercy loaned her a nurse's uniform. The two girls, during their brief acquaintance, became good friends, and Grace Rosebury told Mercy that she was going to England to stay with friends of her father, whom she had never seen, and that it bad been arranged that she was to marry one of the nephews of the house. Suddenly a shell hit the hospital and a flying splinter struck Grace Rosebury on the head. In the confusion that followed, the surgeon, seeing her in a nurse's uniform, mistook her for a nurse, and after a rapid examination, pronounced her dead. An opportunity had arisen and Mercy could not resist the temptation. She had never known happiness and Grace had never known misery. She took Grace Rosebury's effects, and declared herself to be the general's daughter. She arrived safely in England, and was received with open arms by Lady Janet Roy and her nephew. She soon won her way into the hearts of all the family, but her happiness could not last. She must be found out sooner or later. One of the first people she met at the house of Lady Janet Roy was Julian Grey, the pastor of the refuge. He remembered her at once, but she denied all knowledge of him. To make matters worse, she fell in love with him and he with her, despite her nominal engagement to Lady Janet's nephew. The crisis came when the real Grace Rosebury, who was not dead, arrived on the scene and denounced Mercy as an impostor. Everyone immediately turned against Mercy except Julian Grey, who loved her and offered her his care and protection.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-22 00:51:29.720000000

One such house is filled mainly with circus people, a decidedly motley crowd. Among them is a fat lady, a female living skeleton, a strong man, a seven-foot giant and a two-foot midget woman. Various love affairs are in progress. Both the giant and the strong man love the fat lady, while the living skeleton wants the strong man, who hates her. One night, the strong man, who is jealous of the midget, offers her many indignities, such as squashing her under his high bat. Her part is taken by the giant, who has taken quite a fancy to her. Enraged at the treatment she has received, the midget determines to put a kink in the strong man's freshness and incidentally do a good turn to the giant. Carefully watching the movements of the strong man, the midget sees him leave notes at the rooms of both the living skeleton and of the fat lady. With the assistance of the giant, she gets over the transom of the fat lady's door and takes the note, which she exchanges with that left under the door of the skeleton's room. The result is that each woman gets the letter intended for the other. When they all meet in the morning, the skeleton falls on the neck of the strong man and warmly embraces him, much to his disgust, while the fat lady seeks consolation in the arms of the love-sick giant. Both the midget and the giant are satisfied with their night's adventure.	English	USA	N/A	2014-08-19 00:48:58.550000000

Who put mucilage on Miss Galgreen's false teeth? Who flirted with the French dancing teacher? Who put snuff in the school books? The answer was, "Miss Mischief." The girl remained at the seminary exactly one month. The principal finally expelled her. Farm life is usually very monotonous and the section where "Miss Mischief's" parents lived was no exception to the rule. But the girl soon made the little rural community as lively as Main Street on Saturday night. Her father always had to hunt for his spectacles, tacks seemed to find their way into his cowhide boots, the dog frequently raced wildly about the yard with a tin can tied to his tail, and the minister passed the doorway with a hostile glare. The boys all liked her and neglected work so frequently that their irate fathers had to threaten them with horsewhips to induce them to work. The girls, robbed of sweethearts, prayed for some awful fate to befall the siren. Two young men, to whom the girl showed the most favor, had decided to fight a duel, but the girl laughed them out of the idea, and persuaded them to settle the affair by a battle between their pet roosters. The affair was shrouded with mystery and even Miss Mischief's mother did not know about it, But when various masculine and feminine figures came hurling down the grain chute and landed on the ground with resounding thumps, she made inquiries. They excitedly told her that the constable was after them and limped and hobbled away as fast as they could. When it became known that the constable had been no where around and that it was another of "Miss Mischief's" pranks, the rage of her dupes was great. So the girl was bundled off to another school whose principal had a reputation as a great disciplinarian, and the little community once more enjoyed peace.

The town roisters made fun of her and his love. That made trouble and the chief vigilante believed him the cause of it all. So he was "in wrong" all around. The girl's father also sided with the opinion of the world, and sent both the boy and girl away. Mother was on a visit at the time, and therein the need of such a one at home was proved, for once back she sent the father out to bring them home again. The boy in the gold hills had been misunderstood again. Marauding merchants had left their victim on the mountain pass and the boy, coming on the scene, was again accused, but the lie in the end destroyed itself.

He calls on Ethel, vows she is the only girl he has ever loved and gives her an engagement ring to bind their faith. He next calls on Gertrude and goes through practically the same performance. He returns home and is informed by his valet that Marguerite, another girl friend of his called him up. He decides to visit her, and does. While there, he again falls in love and gives her a ring to bind their engagement. Later, he walks along the street and is hit by an automobile. A great crowd gathers and while he is not seriously injured, still he is hurt enough to have to be carried home and put in bed. Newspaper reporters get on the job and a full account of the accident and the injuries to Richard appears in all the papers. Ethel reads of it and getting some flowers, proceeds to pay her fiancé a visit. The other girls also read of it and also come to nurse him back to health. The three meet, with the result that a free-for-all fight very nearly ensues when explanations are in order, and results in the throwing of his rings at Richard by all three girls. Later, fulfilling his prediction that the girls like to be fooled, they return, but again they meet and all chances of reconciliation are at an end.	English	USA	N/A	2014-05-29 01:28:06.323000000

The only resource of the family is the army pension of the old man. Just when the money is needed most, it is lost by the old veteran. The little boy, impressed by the magnitude of the job, writes a letter to Heaven for help, but, as he cannot reach the mall box, puts it into the slot of a hitching post. "The Noisy Six," the chief mischief makers of their college class, on a night raid, drag away the hitching post, and are much sobered when they intercept the letter of the orphan boy to Heaven. They return the post to its original location with a letter of reply enclosed. Then they follow the boy home and surreptitiously slip in the amount of money that was lost. The boy and old Carter are led to believe that the money has come straight from Heaven. "The Noisy Six" stopped their mischief-making for an errand of mercy, and impressed youth in the faith of the higher power.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-27 19:40:09.103000000

The old actor, bewildered and with his dreams still vividly before him, wanders back to the theater, gains entrance to the deserted stage through a coal chute, gets into the star's dressing-room, dons the Richelieu costume, turns on all the stage lights, and plays Richelieu grandiloquently and to his heart's content. His ambition is realized; but his feeble spark of vitality spends itself in the heroic effort and old Murdock falls back into the throne chair, dead. The next day at rehearsal they find him there, a sublime old figure clothed in the scarlet and ermine of Cardinal Richelieu.	English	USA	N/A	2014-03-09 00:08:10.793000000

He finds it is no easy matter for an ex-convict to secure employment, but through the kind offices of Mrs. Edmond, who has befriended the wife in her time of need, he obtains a position in Mc. Edmond's office. Fred's employer is quick to appreciate his employee's worth and soon promotes him to a position of trust. One afternoon Fred's wife arranges to meet him and he places his watch on his desk that he may leave promptly. To his watch chain is attached the key to the cash box. When Fred is called from the office to secure change for a large bill, Arthur, an unscrupulous clerk, takes the key and empties the cash box. Mr. Edmond, passing along the street, sees Fred in conversation with a desperate character and does not understand that the young man is endeavoring to reform an old companion. "Once a thief, always a thief!" declares Arthur when the robbery is discovered. The office boy, having faith in Fred, rushes out to meet him and tells him of the incident. Fred, realizing that he will have difficulty in clearing himself, takes to flight. The old companion tells him not to return home, that that is the first place the officers will visit. The husband, however, concludes that he must inform his wife and he is apprehended. When he is conducted to prison and is about to despair his young friend, the office boy, succeeds in clearing his name and bringing about the conviction of Arthur.

She has made up her mind to marry only a young man whom she can save from something or other, or one who can rescue her in some romantic way. Her father comes to her room and asks her to come down to meet Jack Wilson, a young millionaire. She refuses to meet a man in such a commonplace way. When her father insists she packs a bag and announces that she is going to their country home. Boss comes down, carrying an armful of Helen's novels, and explains that the girl is romance-struck. The young man shows Ross an invitation he has, to spend the week-end at his cousin's home. They shake hands, and he leaves for his cousin's place, which, as it happens, adjoins the country home of the Rosses. About a week after Jack's arrival the young people decide to give private theatricals, and assemble for a rehearsal. In the playlet they are giving the leading character is supposed to be a criminal, and the others guards, officers, Salvation Army, etc. At the last moment the man who is taking the leading part is called away, and Jack is urged to take the role. But he refuses. The boys then lay hold of him and force him into the striped suit. As they turn away for a minute he leaps to an open window, jumps through and dashes away, the boys dressed as guards and officers in pursuit. Helen Ross is just then sitting on the grass in the garden and reading, as usual. She hears shouts and, looking up, sees Jack's head over the fence. He jumps over and races in her direction. She decides to save him. As he is about to run past her she stops him and, pulling him down on the ground beside her, takes his head in her lap and hastily places her parasol over him. Just then the mock officers leap over the fence. As soon as they are gone Helen sits up, but Jack seems to have forgotten that he should get up, and continues to lie there. Helen angrily gets up, and his head bangs on the ground. He then stands up and, looking at her more closely, recognizes her as Helen Ross. She, however, does not know him, but believes him to be an escaped convict. She looks him over, and he being handsome, and also having saved him, she of course immediately falls in love with him. The end comes in the conventional way.	English	USA	N/A	2014-05-29 01:26:29.560000000

Her desire for a greater measure of this, to her unknown joy, prompts her to steal away from her abusive parents and wander back to the little station known as "Lonesome." She is taken in by big Ed and the other noble herdsman and develops under the new environment to a bright and cheerful maiden. Out of gratitude, she guards the welfare of her benefactors and prompts them to nobler deeds of manhood. Her activity in behalf of her friends causes her to arouse the animosity of the keeper of the one grog shop "Lonesome" boasted of and with the decrease in business he conspires against "Pride," as she becomes known to the people. The plots against her were duly foiled and one would have been disastrous to the perpetrators but for the timely arrival of "Pride," who prevents their untimely demise on the promise never to attempt further molestations.

Band leader/clarinetist Ford Sterling is a romantic rival to trumpeter Raymond Hatton for the affections of pretty Mabel Normand. Sterling enters an amateur night contest at the local vaudeville house, where stage manager Edgar Kennedy gives the quick hook to most of the lame acts. Hatton positions himself in the audience across from Mabel and leads his fellow hecklers in taunting Sterling. Hatton's arsenal contains half-rotten fruits and vegetables which he throws at the haplessly helpless Sterling with amazing accuracy. Finally he heaves a pie that has managed to keep hidden under his jacket, and it glances off clarinetist. Attempting to return fire, Sterling errantly hits Mabel square in the chops with the pastry. The angry recipient of the first thrown pie the face in movie history enthusiastically joins the rest of the audience in throwing anything and everything at the band leader, who has lost the girl but gained the hook.

Ira Wilton and his son-in-law, Harry Bennet, resort to the subterfuge of telling their wives that they are members of the Thirteenth Regiment in order to be sure, of having a night off each week, that night being Friday night, for then the regiment drills. They substantiate their deception by bringing into their little game Laura, Ira's daughter, and her fiancé, Jack Brent, a genuine member of the Thirteenth. Their deception runs along nicely until one Friday night, when the men have gone to the club, their wives find the invitation, and are just about to start out when they discover that the water pipe has burst. Laura informs the men by telephone what is discovered, and warns them to hurry home. They arrive and find that the kitchen and dining room are flooded, and, after all has been given a good soaking, Lord Dudley, an admirer of Laura, manages to stop the flow of water. Just as the trouble concerning the flood has subsided, Jack Brent arrives home and tells the men that the Thirteenth has been ordered to the front. The husbands, seeing a good chance to take a little vacation, purchase soldiers' clothing and fall in behind the Thirteenth Regiment as it passes their wives, but slip out as soon as it is out of sight. They then go to the barn, where they substitute their soldiers' habilaments for civilian clothes and then make all possible haste to the lake, where they intend to spend a little vacation. But their vacation is short-lived, for one day they see in the newspapers that the entire Thirteenth regiment has been wiped out. They hurry home to the old barn, where they get into their regimentals as quickly as possible, not forgetting, however, to add a few rents here and there, to make it appear as if they have had a terrible struggle at the front and in escaping. When they arrive home they observe that Mrs. Wilton's brother has returned from the West and had promised to take care of the "widows." In reply to Lena's (the fat cook's), question concerning her lover, Conrad, they were just about to tell her that he died with her name on his lips, when in come Conrad and Harry Brent, with the news that the newspaper report was all wrong. Ira and Harry fix it up with Conrad, and Jack, desiring to keep on the right side of the old man, tells the women that the men had a terrible fight, and brother Tom forgets about asking questions when a couple of good cigars are shoved into his mitt.

Rusty laughs at him and tells him he will not get a chance to reform, as the police will hound him to death. Hardy receives a new suit of clothes and five dollars, and is met up the prison door by his daughter, Helen. He gets work in a grocery store, but a detective recognizes him and tells the proprietor that he is harboring an ex-convict, and Hardy is discharged. Helen has been working and saving her money, and she suggests to her father that they go west and start life anew in the west. Hardy is given a chance to make good, being employed as a watchman in the little western bank. Lieut. Baker, of the U. S. Cavalry, meets Helen, and the two young people fall in love. Hardy writes to Rusty as follows: "Dear Pal Rusty: Got a good job as a night watchman in a bank. Don't laugh. It's on the square. Can you imagine me watching a safe with twenty thousand in it and dead easy to crack, but I'm temptation proof as long as I can let the Amber Devil, whiskey, alone. Look for a letter from you shortly. Your old pal, Jim Hardy." A week later Rusty takes advantage of visiting day to secure access to the lockers, and escapes dressed in a guard's uniform. He makes his way to Hardy's town, and is taken in by the latter and fed and clothed. Detective Burton, on the trail of the escaped convict, follows his man. Rusty sees him in a saloon and rushes back in fear to Hardy. He plies Hardy with whiskey, and tells him that the detective will make him lose his Job, and that he had better crack the safe and get away with the money. Helen tries to interfere, but Rusty roughly tells her to keep still or he will tell her sweetheart her father is an ex-convict. That night they attempt to rob the bank. Rusty keeps watch while Hardy enters and blows open the vault doors. The detective is on the job, however, and Hardy finds himself looking into the barrel of a pistol held by Burton at the window. Rusty sneaks up behind the detective and deals him a crashing blow, rendering him unconscious. Helen, who has mustered up courage at the last moment to attempt to stop the robbery and save her father from crime, rushes up and is attacked by Rusty. Hardy runs to the defense of his daughter and in the scuffle is shot and killed, Rusty making his escape. The banker believes that his watchman has been killed by the burglar. Helen confesses everything to Lieut. Baker, who goes to the detective, when he has regained consciousness and persuades him to remain silent regarding Hardy's past. He tells Helen that she is not to blame for her father's sins, and marries her. Rusty flees into lands occupied by hostile Indians, and is attacked, meeting a tragic death.

But Paquita was in love with Paul Hapgood, an American, and would not hear of it. She wrote to Paul and told him to take her away. He came and Paquita's father renounced her as his daughter forever. Grabbing a gun he bade them leave his estate. Then when they had gone, in replacing his pistol, it dropped, wounding him fatally. With his last strength, he wrote the truth on a slip of paper and placed it in the bible. The Mexicans, headed by Pedro, caught the pair and accused them. To save her lover, Paquita made the grand sacrifice and confessed to the killing. Then Paul stepped forward, and pushing his sweetheart aside, took the blame himself. They took him out to lynch him and Paquita fell on her knees to pray. Then she found her father's note which completely vindicated the lovers and put to shame the spiteful Pedro.

This arouses the official ire of Fred "the star wearer," and he soundly trounces the half-breed rascal. Now Fred has an intrepid sweetheart. Sally, who is a well-spring of information and is naturally hated by law-breakers. "Injun" Jim gets reinforcements and carries off the girl as a hostage. Fred senses they are making for the mine, so he girds on his guns and goes in the same direction. The desperadoes arrange to "dynamite" Sally, but she cuts the fuse in two by a well aimed shot after they have sought safety at a distance. This saves her sweetheart Fred, who rushes to her rescue, and they both retreat to a cabin. The dynamiters are obstinate and place another cartridge, so that the cabin will be blown to pieces. The daring Fred picks up the keg of powder and rushing out rolls it down on Injun Jim and his fellow mischief-makers. They are so dazed from the effects of the explosion that they find themselves in irons' when they recover consciousness, and Fred single-handed delivers them to the authorities.

The drift of this story with danger ever imminent, has plentiful spice of comedy, diversified by daring and wild, exciting drives. It was a time when men thought quick and shot quick, self-preservation being Nature's first law. The stage-coach, having the precious freight of two fair girls and much of Uncle Sam's mail, goes through on schedule time, despite the fact that a band of outlaws leagued to rapture the mail coach. The shotgun man and the driver manage to thwart the plans of the badmen without blood-shed. The company give them ample reward for bringing the mail on time, but more surprising and acceptable is the reward of the fair ones whose lives were saved by their brave guardians.

Being deeply interested in the cause, Elida goes and helps Mrs. Pomeroy minister to sick and wounded soldiers. She becomes a favorite with the men, for she frequently sings to them. This attracts the attention of Lincoln, and he introduces her to M. Fowle, a mission worker, who has become a little discouraged by the soldiers' lack of response to his efforts. Elida's singing awakens the dormant spark of manhood, and more men enlist. In order to stir patriotism, President Lincoln requests Elida to sing at a concert. Haywood comes and is induced to enlist, which pleases Elida so much that Fowle, who has grown to love her, thinks that he is her lover. He keeps his love for her in silence. Sometime later Elida and Fowle are ordered to the front, where there has been an enormous carnage. Elida finds Haywood seriously wounded, after leading a gallant charge to victory. She does all in her power to save him, but he passes away. Fowle's sympathy is so marked that Elida is lead to believe that he has been under the impression that Haywood was her lover. She tells him that he was nothing more to her than a friend. Fowle seizes the opportunity and tells her of his love for her. They are married in the presence of President Lincoln, the only marriage solemnized at the capitol.	English	USA	N/A	2014-11-15 00:47:56.343000000

They part in anger, and when, a year later, they meet on the same battlefield, under a flag of truce, the old spirit of resentment between the brothers grows more acute. Duncan again inside his lines, plays Dixie on his trumpet in defiance, and Joe retorts with "Yankee Doodle." Softly someone breaks this echo of anger and in tones of "Home, Sweet Home." Then the heart of each stern man melts and they cry out. "Not Blue or Gray, but my brother." They do not fight again until the conclusion of the great conflict, when Joe comes home with the laurels of the victor, and poor, broken Duncan, ill in the bitterness of defeat. In the home of his father, with the arms of his sweetheart about him, he finds life still worth living, and Joe comes openhanded to help him carve out a new fortune for their families.

This causes much joking among her companions, who cannot understand what has come over her. A chance remark of the little girl's shows Winnie what a false life she is leading, and she decides to abandon it. Edward Ferris, her man-friend, laughs at her when she tells him her intention and insultingly asks her to come to him when she needs money. Good luck attends Winnie, who obtains a typist's position in a city office. She lives very happily in a boarding-house and cuts herself off entirely from all her former companions. While working here she meets Roy Dayton, who falls in love with her, and after a time proposes marriage to her. His earnest pleading wins her consent and she is looking forward to the wedding day. Edward Ferris finds out where she is working, and one day shadows her to her home. She sees him and lets him see plainly that she does not want anything to do with him, but he forces himself upon her by calling at the house the next day. When she tells him of her engagement he laughs rudely at her and asks her what her intended husband would think of her past life, telling her that if she will come to him she will have all the luxury she can desire. Roy Dayton enters the room and overhears part of what is said. He demands an explanation from Winnie, who cannot give it. Upbraiding her for having won his love falsely, he leaves her in anger. Winnie falls in a swoon and afterwards becomes seriously ill and is taken to a hospital. In her delirium she raves constantly of Roy, who is finally sent for by the nurse, who sees that unless Winnie sees him she will die. When Roy sees the condition of his sweetheart he is stricken with remorse and his love is re-awakened. Warmly clasping her to his heart he asks forgiveness and brings the smile back to her wasted cheeks.	English	USA	N/A	2014-05-26 13:12:19.057000000

With the idea of developing in the natives in his community the spirit of manly citizenship, Dr. Reid requests the War Department to furnish him with a number of discarded Winchesters with which to drill the natives. His request is granted and he succeeds in getting together quite an enthusiastic company. Dr, Reid is not the only instructor in patriotism. Young Pauline Bush, a teacher in the Islands, has for some time been instructing her pupils in all that the American flag means to her. When she finds that Dr, Reid is also patriotically inclined, a bond of friendship is cemented between the two Americans. Bonita, one of Pauline's pupils, has for some time been deeply but hopelessly in love with the young doctor, and is very despondent when she sees the growing attraction between the young Americans. Her father wishes to join Dr. Reid's company, but because of his age is not allowed to do so. Dr. Reid, however, gives him a gun, which the old man becomes very fond of. Camped close to the settlement is a company of Spaniards, one of whom, through disorderly conduct, is stripped of his uniform and driven from camp. This renegade makes his way to the settlement and there encounters Bonita, the young native girl. Bonita's beauty attracts the renegade, who makes insulting advances to her. Doctor Reid witnesses the encounter and after a short, sharp fight with the renegade, he is sent about his business. The renegade, smarting under the drubbing he has received, vows revenge on the American, and when he discovers him drilling the natives, he hastens to the Spanish camp and informs the officer in charge that the American doctor is teaching the Filippinos war. The Spaniards hasten to the settlement and finding Bonita's father fondling the gun given him by the doctor; they decide to make an example of him. They seize the old man and drag him to a nearby wall, where they proceed to execute him, Bonita, who witnesses the shooting of her father, is wild with grief, and runs to her beloved teacher and tells her what has occurred. Pauline fearlessly rushes to the place of the execution, and furiously reprimands the two Spaniards who are standing by the body. They debate for a moment, then grab the teacher and attempt to drag her away. Dr. Reid, who is hunting nearby, sees the struggle and swiftly dispatches both soldiers. He hastens to Pauline's side and leads both girls away. Dr. Reid realizes the significance of the shooting of the old man and quickly gathers his little company together. They are not a moment too soon, for the Spaniards charge the settlement. The women and children hide at the school house, where they are at last joined by the men, fighting each inch of the way. A desperate battle is waged around the tiny school house and the doctor and his little band are more than outnumbered. Bonita sees the battle from a distance and hastens swiftly to the American camp and informs the officer what she has seen. The American troops hurry to the scene of the conflict and reach the schoolhouse just as the doctor, who has fired his last round of ammunition, is about to surrender. The Americans quickly drive the Spaniards from the field, but Bonita, who has followed, is shot. She falls, clutching the American flag which she has learned to love. Dr. Reid and Pauline find the young native girl and feelingly drape her remains with the silken folds of "Old Glory."	English	USA	N/A	2015-01-08 00:02:04.247000000

Goree then lost the proceeds at poker. Pike Garvey's ambitious wife said, "we must now get a feud if we want to be real society folks." Pike Garvey then offered to buy the feud between Abner Coltrane and Goree. Goree consented and the most extraordinary sale ever heard of, the selling of a quarrel, was consummated. Carrey's delight was great when he discovered the man whom he had bought the right to kill was Judge Coltrane, the man who had once sent him to the pen for moonshining. Goree quickly lost his money at gambling. Coltrane found him the next morning, mentally befuddled and entirely unaware of the events of the day before. The colonel had come to call a truce to their feud and to offer him a home. Goree consented. Later in the day they were riding up the mountain to Coltrane's home. Pike was looking through the trees. Goree persuaded the colonel to change clothes with him on the pretext that he wanted to look well when he passed his old home. He received the bullet meant for the colonel.

Lindsley Ferris, head of a banking house, unthinkingly places an important paper in his desk at home, and causes the blame for its mysterious disappearance to rest upon the shoulders of the cashier, Steele, who is subsequently discharged. Sometime later, Ferris discovers the paper, and, desiring to reinstate Steele, calls at his home only to learn that through the death of his invalid wife and his fruitless attempts to secure another position, he and his daughter have immigrated to a distant city. Fifteen years later Steele, returning to the city under an assumed name and now master of millions, determines to bring about the ruin of Ferris, now president of the banking house. At a ball, Marjorie, Steele's daughter, meets and falls in love with Arthur Ferris, son of the bank president. When the young people bring the matter to Steele's attention he turns them down flatly and forbids his daughter from further association with young Ferris. The young man appeals to his father to help him further his suit, and Ferris senior goes to Steele to see what he can do in behalf of his son. But when he learns the identity of Steele, he makes no further entreaties, but leaves immediately. Steele then orders his secretary to buy up the controlling stock of every company with which Ferris is connected. In meditation he hears a voice bidding him to be merciful and at the same time he sees a vision of Christ preaching on the Mount. His strange actions alarm his sister who sends for a doctor, but is told that her brother is only suffering from overwrought nerves. Steele's plans work and a run is precipitated on Ferris' bank. The climax comes when Steele draws a check on Ferris' bank for $25,000. Young Ferris makes frantic appeals to other bankers to come to the aid of his father, but all decline. Under the pretense of desiring solitude the banker sends all persons away, takes a revolver from his desk and shoots himself. As a last resort, Arthur Ferris, ignorant of his father's suicide, goes to Steele, asking him to save his father. Steele, very angry, renounces both father and son. The son is about to throttle Steele, when Marjorie intercedes for her father. Then Steele again hears the mysterious voice, and, calling for a pen and paper, he is about to direct his secretary to deposit enough money in Ferris' bank to tide him over the difficulties when he bears the voices of newsboys yelling "Suicide of Lindsley Ferris." His reparation had been too late and he sinks back, dead in his chair.	English	USA	N/A	2014-03-09 00:13:54.153000000

Masterson, having become a captain of industry, leaves the details of running the works to his employees and moves to another city to take life easy and enjoy the wealth that has come to him after years of toil. Shortly after the departure of Masterson the domineering superintendent cuts the wages of the employees, thereby bringing ruin not only to the factory, but to the homes of the workmen. Jimmie Blake, a young boy of fourteen, the only support of his sister, Maggie, is brutally struck down by Mooney, the superintendent, for being late one morning. Just then a huge iron beam becomes loosened and crashes down upon Jimmie. The laborers declare a strike and carry the boy to his home where the doctor announces that only an operation performed by a skilled specialist will prevent the boy from being a cripple for life. Being without funds Maggie Blake goes to the factory intent upon robbing the safe. Hearing steps upon the stairs, she hides herself in the closet. Masterson, who has been summoned by Mooney who has had a bad fight with the strikers, places the unconscious superintendent in a chair, and, going to the closet for suitable bandages, discovers Maggie, who tells him that she was hiding from the strikers. Bent upon revenge, Maggie, after sending the capitalist for water that she may bathe Mooney's head, calls upon the telephone "Bat" Thomas, her sweetheart, whom she knows is addressing a meeting of the strikers at a hall and tells him that Masterson has her imprisoned in the office. After hearing Maggie's story, Bat leads his men to the office, the door of which is barricaded by Maggie and Masterson. Maggie helping in the barricade work for Masterson, having heard her pitiful story, assures reparation. Bat affects an entrance into the office by climbing to the roof and going through a window. In his struggle with Masterson the stove is upset and soon the room is ablaze. The fire spreads rapidly and soon the whole factory is a scathing mass of flames. By a unique method all escape from the building just before the walls fall in. Later, with the owner at the helm, the Masterson Iron Works again becomes a model factory. Bat, with Maggie as his wife, is the new superintendent, and little Jimmie is restored to health by the specialist.	English	USA	N/A	2014-12-24 00:02:33.607000000

Ben made an appointment to look at the deposit and did so - quite unaware that Jim Halliday, with two bad pals, kept close watch of his every movement. They met him on the road going back and remarked that it was a bad town for experts, to which sully Ben merely smiled. That night Mabel was awakened by a scratching noise. Rising from bed she seized a butcher knife and hurried into the other room. A hand was slowly appearing through a freshly made opening under the cabin. Only the ghastly arm could be seen, but in that fleeting glance Mabel saw an American flag plainly tattooed on the outstretched arm. Without an instant's hesitation she plunged the knife through the arm - there was a howl of pain, hurried footsteps and all was silent again. Next morning when Ben called, he was told of the nocturnal visit. He quietly mounted his horse and rode off in the direction of the claim. In the bushes he saw Halliday standing, with back toward him, an outstretched bare arm resting on a convenient tree trunk. Ben drew his gun, Halliday faced quickly about and a few minutes later was safely lodged in the local jail. Then Ben rode back to the Whitaker cabin as his thoughts turned toward softer things.

Nina hardly has finished residing a fairy story to Trixie, her little sister, in which there is a horrid mean stepmother, when their father enters and announces to them that they are about to acquire a stepmother of their own. This is more than self respecting children can be expected to endure, and taking their treasure with them, they flee from the house. They are finally found on the street by a policeman who questions them. At this moment, Constance, the sweet young woman who is betrothed to their father, rides up in her auto, recognizes the children and stops to bear their tale of woe. She is fairly aghast at their explanation to the officer that they are about to come under the sway of a horrid stepmother who will beat them, starve them, and work them to death. Of course, Nina and Trixie have never seen their father's fiancée to know her as such. Constance seizes her opportunity to win the children. She tells them she will play their fairy godmother and take them to her home where no bad stepmother can ever get them. She gets them home and informs their father by 'phone of the plot she has conceived; he enters into the "game," and is overjoyed with the tact and sweetness of her attitude toward his little ones. Finally the kiddies grow homesick for Daddy, and Constance sends for him. Torn between their two loves, they make Daddy promise to marry their fairy godmother so they will not have to part from her; and thus everybody in the household is made happy.

Setting Sun and Big Eagle, the dominant chiefs, as an evidence of good will and with the hope of perpetuating peace, arrange that their children, Deer Foot and Red Wing, shall marry when grown. Years elapse and find Deer Foot and Red Wing prominent pupils at Carlisle. They accept their betrothal as agreeable. An ambitious and unscrupulous half-breed, Mathews, has a fancy for Red Wing. Deer Foot has a rival in Mathews, who succeeds in drugging the former, thereby carrying off the honors in an athletic contest. Red Wing, who has been led to believe Deer Foot lost by drunkenness, snubs him at the party following the athletic meet. Mathews puts fuel to the flame of her indignation, showing her a forged note in which his rival's name is linked with another woman. The same night Deer Foot receives a letter announcing the death of his father, calling him to the reservation to assume chieftainship. He releases his love from the pledge of their fathers. In her misery Red Wing turns to Mathews and they become engaged. Subsequently she learns the half-breed already has a wife. She upbraids him and he strikes her. This breaks the engagement. She meets Deer Foot and tells him of Mathews' perfidy. They follow Mathews when he disbarks from a train. They trail him to the desert, empty his canteen and leave him in misery, as they ride away to the happiness they have sought in their own village.	English	USA	N/A	2014-05-10 04:48:02.580000000

After a long discussion with her collaborator, Philip Morbray, concerning their next novel, Ruth Sterling offers one thousand dollars wager that within a month she will have found a new sensation. Philip laughingly agrees and the bet is made. She goes away to a small fishing village in Maine and stays at the home of one of the coastguards, David Skelton and his mother. Here she is treated as if she were one of the family, and a bond of affection soon springs up between Ruth and the old lady. Being thrown constantly into the society of Ruth, David falls in love with her, a fact which is soon discovered by the lady. In order to hasten his declaration of love, she one day pretends to sprain her ankle and allows him to carry her to the house. When he takes her up into his arms he tells her of his great love for her and she replies to him with a soft kiss. The next day Ruth receives a telegram from Philip asking about the wager and telling her that the month is up. She replies to his message by another telegram, asking him to meet her at dinner the next day. A busybody sees her message at the telegraph office and tells David what is in it. The result is that when Ruth tells him and his mother that she must go to New York, he decides to follow her and find out who Philip may be. David, watching through a window of Ruth's house, sees her meet Philip Morbray and hears Ruth tell him of how she fooled the coastguard into loving her. He at once enters the room and denounces the young lady is no measured terms as a false and heartless woman. When Ruth sees David she realizes that, in spite of the way in which she has used the man, she really loves him. She holds out her arms to him and begs him to forgive her, but he will not listen to her. David leaves the house telling her that he hopes never to see her again, telling her that his trust in women is forever broken. After he has gone Ruth tears up the check given her by Philip, who agrees that he has lost his wager, and sinks mournfully upon a couch, broken-hearted because of the wound she has inflicted on the man that she now really loves,	English	USA	N/A	2014-10-21 00:17:03.467000000

Harry discussed marriage with his father but the aristocrat said no. So Harry did what every other American young man does under the circumstances - marries the girl. They tried to keep it secret, but Harry's dear friend, Bert, who in secret loved the girl, took plans to let Reeder know of it. Thus the young couple were driven from the parental roof and took a small, cheap bungalow. After that Bob wouldn't let her work - he took the violin and secured her place at the cabaret. Bert often went there and exulted in secret. But if Bert had done nothing more serious than exult in secret, everything would have gone well, but Bert insisted in seeing Vail and times his visits so as to be found by Harry. One day Bert, refused admission by Vail, pinned a note to the door-post, intimating that she intended to elope with him that afternoon. At the same time the heart of the old man Reeder relented and he started toward the little bungalow. Thus Harry coming home found the note a minute after, captured Bert and trounced him soundly. The father, witnessing the incident, found no further enmity in his heart toward the young couple and took them home with him to better things.	English	USA	N/A	2014-03-09 00:16:49.683000000

Louis waits until the poison shall have taken effect and then enters the dining room to gaze at his dead enemy. He is surprised to see Oscar serenely walking about, and when he learns what has occurred he bolts for the door and rushes madly down the street. Police and pedestrians attempt to stop the supposed mad man, but he bowls over every one in his path and continues on his flight, pursued by a howling mob.

Green was a woman so thoroughly immersed in the intricacies of the Bulls and Bears of the Exchange that all other considerations were forgotten. Her people, happily married and scattered to the four winds, wrote insistent but vain letters to her to abandon money grabbing and enjoy the felicity of normal married life. These letters she treated with contemptuous indifference. No man interested her until Arthur Roydon was brought directly under her notice. During business hours she finds her mind straying to him, and when he enters her office one day, the warm spring tide of love fills her heart. He is all business, cold and aloof, places a check in her bands for stock investment and leaves abruptly. She resolves to win him, but though their meetings at the club are frequent, he remains unchanged. Spurned and lonely, she returns to her apartment late one night and after the expiration of many hours and the consumption of many cigarettes and brandies and sodas, she solves the question. She is too mannish. A phone message to a woman's outfitter's, a change of clothes and manners, and Arthur Hoydon falls completely under the feminine charms of J.

Colonel Haskins and his only daughter, Zara, live on a plantation to which the old soldier has retired. The adjoining plantation is owned by Robert Harding, a young English gentleman, who seeks his fortune in the cultivation of tea. He has just arrived in the country, and is not acquainted with his neighbors. Zara is a beautiful girl. She delights in outdoor life and is fond of taking morning rides on her big pet elephant, "Toddles." One morning she meets young Harding. He salutes her with a smile and she stops for a chat. It ends by her inviting him to join her in the howdah, "Toddles" assisting him to mount. As the result of this meeting Zara and Harding fall in love. About this time Lieut. Driscoll, an aristocratic officer, chances to call at the Haskins plantation, where he is royally entertained by the colonel. He is attracted by Zara's beauty and shows her marked attentions, much to her dislike. Her father is pleased, on the other hand, and shows the lieutenant that he favors his suit. Driscoll begs Zara to accompany him on a ride the following morning. She refuses; but he insists so strongly that Zara grows angry. Then he insultingly asks for a reason and she strikes him with her crop. Afterwards she mounts "Toddles" and soon joins young Harding. Driscoll, who has followed her stealthily on horseback, discovers the lovers and immediately carries the news to Colonel Haskins. The colonel is furious and rides at once to the rendezvous of the lovers. There he berates Harding and is about to strike him, when "Toddles" seizes him with his trunk. The next day the Colonel assures Driscoll that Zara will be his wife. Zara is called before the two men and indignantly refuses to obey her father. The latter threatens to force her. She notifies Harding and they elope. Lieut. Driscoll spies on their movements and conveys word to the colonel, who is seized with temporary apoplexy at the news. He recovers sufficiently to despatch Driscoll to prevent the clergyman from performing the ceremony. Driscoll arrives too late, as Zara and Harding are man and wife. Colonel Haskins refuses to receive Zara and renounces her. Three years elapse and the Harding household is blessed with a baby. Zara learns that her father, under the evil influence of Driscoll, is a victim of intemperance. She calls at the old home with her child, hoping for reconciliation; but her father refuses to receive her at the prompting of Driscoll. She calls again, with the same result. Now "Toddles" takes a hand. He carries the baby and the cradle in which it lies to the colonel. He places the cradle on the steps, but the colonel waves him away. "Toddles" shakes his trunk in token of refusal, and in brute language urges his master to take the child to his heart. The colonel gives in and takes up the cradle with its cooing burden. Then "Toddles" grasps his master's hand in his trunk and leads him to the Harding home.				2013-12-09 00:00:00

Parker	Harold Lockwood, Kathlyn Williams, Eugenie Besserer, Al Ernest Garcia	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	A comedy-drama of two generations of suffragettes.	Miss America is a mannish, presumably advanced type of womanhood, who refuses to surrender her rights by marrying the young man she loves, because he has what she considers "too old-fashioned ideas" concerning the femininity of women. She gives oat her ideas in a bale-fellow-well-met-way to the modest man and be retires to sadly think it over as she goes joyously on to "whoop it up" at a suffrage meeting. Returning from a day of strenuous service in disorder and window smashing, she casts herself in exhaustion upon the couch in her study and falls asleep. Then comes to her in dreams a picture of the quiet, delightful days of old, so well remembered from the tales told by her grandmother. Old Father Time makes bold to intrude and conduct her back along the path of the storied past, decade by decade, until she arrives at the age of gallantry, when great grandmother was a girl. It shows the courtly old days in the quaint, colonial mansion where grand dames, powdered beauties, periwigged old gallants and lively beaux danced to stately and dignified minuet. This is all in striking contrast to the syncopated ragtime and "animal dances" that hold cheap and unworthy possession in current esteem. She awakens in shame at the present conditions, tears the banner calling "votes for women" from the wall of her room, and again surrenders herself to the gentle surroundings of her true sphere. The disappointed lover having gained in manhood correspondingly comes to claim his own. In view of the fact that the right to love and be happy is absolutely constitutional.

Five years passed. Life has been growing harder for Bessie, although she has been deserted by her worthless husband.

As the two were inseparable, it soon became known that they would soon marry. This news greatly displeased Bill Higgins, who promptly set about to make trouble. He wrote an anonymous note and attached it to Ben's saddle, saying " She don't love you. She was with Bill Higgins all day yesterday. A Friend." When Ben found it he frowned and tucked it idly into his pocket. This happened regularly thereafter. If Ben had been a trifle older he might have smiled derisively, but he didn't. Youth and jealousy are old acquaintances and so Ben made his visits shorter and shorter. One day, lonesomeness overcame him and he sent the notes in a bundle to Margy. She read them and promptly burst into tears. Then, with true Western suddenness, she hurried into the house, where she told her brother all her trouble. The later only smiled, but looked more serious when he caught Margy loading a big six-shooter. He told Bill to watch out for himself and ceased further to trouble himself. But Bill was more wise. Carefully unloading the bullets, he substituted blanks and when Margy later threatened him he only smiled. And then Ben rode up, utterly miserable and determined upon an understanding with Margy. This was easily obtained to the vast satisfaction of everyone concerned, but Bill Higgins.	English	USA	N/A	2013-12-25 00:00:00

Assunta Spina è una bella stiratrice ed ha per amante Michele, ma Raffaele continua a girarle attorno. Un giorno, durante il pranzo di onomastico a Marechiaro, la donna invita Raffaele a ballare : per Michele è troppo, prende il coltello e la sfregia. Viene arrestato e condannato a due anni, da scontare nel carcere di Avellino. In tribunale, la donna viene avvicinata da Federigo Funelli, un cancelliere che si offre di aiutarla per far restare Michele a Napoli. La donna accetta l'aiuto dell'uomo e ne diviene l'amante, fino ad innamorarsene. La sera dell'antivigilia di Natale Assunta aspetta Federigo a casa, ma arriva Michele, scarcerato in anticipo. La donna confessa tutto, e l'uomo, pazzo di gelosia, affronta il rivale e lo uccide con un coltello, dileguandosi. Quando arrivano gli agenti, Assunta dichiara di esser stata lei ad uccidere Federigo e viene portata in prigione.	N/A	Italy	N/A	2015-02-01 00:11:06.490000000

"Cameo" Kirby, so called because of his fondness for cameos, is the son of a New Orleans plantation owner who dies insolvent. When the plantation and slaves are sold at auction, Cameo's favorite body-servant is bought at auction by one of his father's friends, John Randall. John and Kirby head north on a Mississippi river boat where Randall meets Colonel Moreau. There he loses heavily on a wager and consents to a game of poker hoping to get back his losses. Kirby, through his friendship with another gambler, is adept at the manipulation of cards and suspects that Moreau is not an honest player. He joins the game and soon Randall, having lost all of his money, wagers the old homestead. Kirby wins the hand and Moreau accuses him of cheating while Randall, unappreciative of the fact that Kirby won the hand to keep Randall's estate falling into Moreau's hands, shoots himself. When his body is taken ashore, Kirby meets Randall's daughter, Adele, and instantly falls in love with her. But Kirby is on very shaky ground as he is known as the man who caused Adele's father to commit suicide, and she treats him to some southern disdain. Her brother, Tom, vows to take revenge on Kirby. He and Moreau have an un-witnessed duel and Colonel is shot dead by Kirby, who is somewhat of a dead shot among his many other talents. But Tom takes the gun from Moreau's hand so it will appear he was unarmed. Kirby, slave-owner becomes a fugitive from justice. This also deals a blow to his courtship of Adele. But, a true-blue southern gentleman such as Kirby should be able to win the day, sooner or later.				2013-10-14 00:00:00

The friendship of Damon, the senator, and Pythias, the soldier, is famous in Ancient Syracuse. Because the general Dionysius is infatuated with Calanthe, Pythias' sweetheart, he sends the soldier to fight the Carthaginians at the Battle of Agrigentum. Pythias returns in triumph, and then angers Dionysius even further when he defeats Aristle, the general's favorite, in a chariot race. During the wedding ceremony for Pythias and Calanthe, Dionysius has himself proclaimed sovereign while Damon is absent from the Senate. Shocked, Damon attempts to assassinate Dionysius, but he fails and is sentenced to death. In order for Damon to say goodbye to his wife and son, Pythias leaves Calanthe and takes his friend's place in prison, offering to die in Damon's place if he does not return. Despite several tests of the strength of their friendship, they remain loyal to each other and so impress Dionysius that he allows them both to go free.	English	USA	N/A	2015-02-23 00:35:10.160000000

Columbia produced a series of Charles Starrett westerns that they called "Peter B. Kyne productions" but, other than allowing the use of his name, writer Peter B. Kyne was not the producer on any of the films in this series, and didn't even write the few he is credited with by some sources. Since the source for this error is one of those often-used and often-wrong sources that many researchers use, and said source is one of those that never bother correcting the multitude of errors in their catalogs, the chances of some uninformed source adding Peter B. Kyne back to this film as the Producer is highly likely. This Harold Shumate story finds Texas ranch-foreman Steve Braddock in charge of driving a large herd of cattle overland from Texas to Dodge City, Kansas. Slim Grayson, the eastern-educated son of the ranch owner, is along to sing songs around the campfire. The trail drive part only lasts until the herd reaches Plainview, where Steve, Slim and the cowhands rescue Marian Phillips after she has been kidnapped off a stage by a gang led by Dawson. She tells Steve her father is a local rancher named Phillips, who she has not seen since she was a young girl, but Steve knows no rancher by that name but from her description, he feels sure that Plainview gambling-hall owner Kenyon Jackson is her father. Of course he is and he, of course, is also the secret head of the Dawson gang, and Steve's tasks are to keep Marian from learning the truth about her father, cleaning up the gang and persuading the father to reform.

Blaming his infant daughter Dixie for his wife's death, Phillips leaves her with Mrs. Hughes, his housekeeper. Meanwhile, Mrs. Moore, a wardrobe mistress who has kept a scrapbook on Phillips, must raise her infant daughter Florence alone when her husband dies. Eighteen years later, Mrs. Hughes has squandered all of Phillips' money on her ne'er-do-well son Bert. Dixie then leaves and goes to New York where she receives a part in a Broadway play from Marc Herbert, her father's friend. When Phillips returns looking for Dixie, Mrs. Hughes and Bert convince Florence, Bert's new wife, to pose as Dixie. She soon is disgusted by the plot, however, and returns to her mother, with whom Dixie now lives. Meanwhile, Herbert innocently sends Phillips word of Dixie's success, but when he goes to see her, she bitterly rebukes him. Phillips again leaves, but eventually he and Florence realize their feelings for each other and are able to marry after Bert dies in a burglary attempt. After Mrs. Moore's death, Dixie is reconciled to her father.	English	USA	N/A	2014-06-06 01:24:47.103000000

A fascinating work of high artistry, "Judith of Bethulia" will not only rank as an achievement in this country, but will make foreign producers sit up and take notice. It has a signal and imperative message, and the technique displayed throughout an infinity of detail, embracing even the delicate film tinting and toning, marks an encouraging step in the development of the new art. Ancient in story and settings, it is modern in penetrative interpretation - it is a vivid history of one phase of the time it concerns, and is redemptive as well as relative, a lesson from one of those vital struggles that made and unmade nations as well as individuals, yet it is not without that inspiring influence that appeals powerfully to human sense of justice. The entire vigorous action of the play works up to the personal sacrifice of Judith of Bethulia, a perilous chance she takes for the sake of the lives and happiness of her people. She dares expose herself to overwhelming humiliation and dishonor in a challenge of beauty to strength, struggles through a conversion of sentiment that makes the high crisis more acute, and sets at defiance the "better-death-than-dishonor" platitude, escaping both through that all-conquering combination in a woman, great physical beauty joined to lofty intelligence. She enters upon a relation of constant peril - only delicate treatment saves the situation at times - abandons her native purity of conduct and dares her own undoing, yet the noble end justified the dangerous means, and she emerges idealized by her people, an apotheosis of splendid womanhood. Bethulia is a fortified town of Judea, guarding a hill pass through which an invading Assyrian army must march in order to enter Judea. In the town lives Judith, a devout young woman of lofty character and remarkable beauty, when the place is stormed by Holofernes at the head of a large army. The fighting before the gate brings into action an enormous number of soldiers on both sides, and those engines of war, such as the battering ram and catapult, which were used by the fighting male of other days under close condition of furious combat. One desperate assault after another is repelled, scaling ladders are thrown down, great rocks are showered upon the invaders, and the wonder is that they keep at it. The reason is that Holofernes has a way of torturing and killing unsuccessful captains. As officer had better die in the thick of battle than return with a confession of defeat. Holofernes is as merciless as nature to all who fail. The great leader's brutality of his captains when they do not succeed in carrying the fortress by storm indicates what the inhabitants of Bethulia may expect in the event of capture and serves to intensify the clash of character later on - it adds peril to the undertaking of Judith when she resolves to sacrifice herself for her people. Holofernes, after making a horrible example of defeated captains by frightful torture, resorts to strategy. His soldiers have seized the wells from which the inhabitants of Bethulia obtained their water supply, and their leader adopts waiting tactics, diverting himself with dancing girls to break the tedium. Bethulia is on the verge of famine, and the besieged are almost ready to surrender the fortress and all Judea to the spoilers, when Judith goes forth in her finest raiment, accompanied only by her maid, enters the Assryian camp and obtains an interview with the merciless Holofernes. Against his formidable strength, his brutal ferocity and cunning, his absolute power, are matched her fascinating personality directed by intelligence and hidden purpose. She is willing to carry "her fault on her shoulders like a coronation mantle." The dangerous and difficult situation from this point to Judith's terrible triumph and the defeat of the invading Assyrians is pictured without loss of force or charm by extreme delicacy of treatment. Beauty is constantly asserted by almost reckless prodigality in the matter of costume, and by the appeal of delightful acting. The feminine sweetness and shyness of the lovely Judith are intensified by her advances and retreats in measuring her sex attractions against his formidable power. She is weakened at the critical moment by a sudden flame of passion and compassion aroused in her breast, but self-control returns at a thought of all that is at stake, the safety and happiness of thousands of her people, and she dares be all and do all that revolts her finer nature from a deep hatred of injustice and wrong meted out to her peace-loving kindred and friends, from a noble desire to preserve her country and the destinies of her race.

The messenger gives Fluff the cloak, who wishes to be happy again, while a legal loophole places Bud on the throne, and they empty the treasury to buy toys.

Judith has an identical twin sister named Rose, much more lovable than the revenge-seeking Judith, and Rose is in love with Alan. By the time chapter 15 comes along, Judith has also fallen in love with Alan, but, alas too late. But she shows up at the wedding of Alan and Rose, and gets a big break. Lightning strikes the chapel and good-sister Rose is killed and the bride groom stricken unconscious.

He comes on with a big telescope and looks through it, finds everything in fine condition from earth to moon, so the party start out. As they rise and turn upside down then right side up, they start on their journey to the moon. They pass over a busy city, knocking down buildings and chimneys. After passing over the city they come in contact with the planet Saturn. Bump it, encircle it, and then on their way to the moon they ride through the air and see an old man coming out of the planet Mars. The anchor on the aeroplane accidentally catches the old man by the neck and carries him off. The old man tries to get away, and he sees Halley's comet coming along and he grabs hold of the tail of the comet and goes away. One of the men in the aeroplane sees him and takes out a lasso. With a couple of swings he catches the old man around the neck and drags him behind. At last the moon is reached. The man in the moon opens his mouth and they all go in. The party drop from top of the moon all in a heap. They get up, look around and a large bird comes in and lays an egg larger than itself and flies off. The travelers put the egg on a fire, which is burning nearby. The egg cracks and a lot of little birds are hatched. Suddenly a strange animal comes on the scene and eats the little birds one by one. The animal fills up and bursts. Another enormous crazy-looking animal comes out of the cave and chases the men off the moon into the sea.				2013-10-09 00:00:00

The film opens in a picturesque back street of a Spanish town, where an artist is busy at his easel. Chapo, the little hunchback, sees him and lingers by the artist. Pedestrians come and go and push him aside, but the boy is oblivious to everything but the painter and his magic. The art of the painter arouses a great latent gift in the hunchback. He so strongly covets artist's materials in the store of a curio dealer that he tries to steal them and is caught. A kind padre, himself an artist, rescues him from the irate dealer and teaches him to draw and paint. One day in the mission garden he sees lovely Eleanor, who becomes the idol of his dreams, the inspiration of his brush. She has, unfortunately, given herself to the profligate, Arguello, who abandons her. Chapo takes her to his own poor quarters and cares for her. Two years later she dies, and the hunchback, still rising in the world of art, adopts the two-year-old daughter. The scene advances twenty years. Chapo, the once neglected and despised, is a giant in the world of Parisian art and the adopted daughter has grown to be a beautiful young woman. They return to the old home, and there is Arguello, living a cumberer of the ground in his old age of vice, cards and liquor. He still has eyes and be leers upon the fair young flower leaning on the arm of Chapo. The indignant old padre calls on Arguello exclaiming, "she is your child." The shock and shame finally overcome him and he dies on the spot.				2013-05-13 00:00:00

Giles Bateson is expelled from college for misconduct. His angry father, the Earl, sends him a message: "Never let me see you again until you have earned a half crown and proven yourself worthy of confidence." Giles meets Sally, the parson's daughter, who believes Giles to be the gardener. On a walk, they meet some gypsies, who show Sally a "magical ring." Giles buys it for her, and Sally comes to believe in its power when her wishes -- such as for a new dress and shoes to wear to the Earl's party for the villagers -- come true, although actually Giles is responsible. At the party, Sally accidentally discovers the note from the Earl and realizes who Giles really is. She determines to reconcile father and son, and begins visiting the Earl each day to play chess and distract him from the pain he suffers from gout. The gypsies tell her that she can find an herbal cure at Devil's Cliff, but when Sally doesn't return home, a search party finds her lying unconscious by the herb. The Earl is upset to hear of her accident and goes to visit her; when his horse goes lame in the village, he unwittingly borrows one from his own son for half a crown.

Instead of shocking, Betty finds them fascinating and they install in her a desire to learn more about the fascinations of the world. When Jim Denning proposes to her, she says she loves him but she must see the world first. Angrily he leaves her as she sits beside the fireplace, whose dreamy flames inspire her to tempt a knowledge of things unknown to her.

At a vital moment when she is about to faint dead away, the faithful Jim arrives and catches her in his arms. Betty awakens to find it has all been just a dream, and faithful Jim has no problem convincing her of the full meaning of a home and that the world and its false promises are not for her.
