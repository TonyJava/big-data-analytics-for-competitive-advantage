0002,Hitcher The,1986,Editor s note Sites running 2 10 netnews will munge headers of articles in moderated groups not named mod something If you get my name instead of Mark Leeper s in the From line please encourage your S A and your feed s S A to upgrade to 2 11 Thank you And now on to our review ecl Capsule review Boring actioner about a psychotic hitchhiker whom the scriptwriter makes unkillable Contrived unbelievable and ultimately dull thriller is one more film to waste Rutger Hauer You want a thriller with lots of mindless action no logic and a bunch of fractional dimensional characters Cable this month is running what passes for entertainment in some quarters The film is THE HITCHER and as a friend of mine would say it sucks pond water Actually I think this one could turn back a raging river Our main character I don t think we ever get his name so I will call him Poor Schnook is a teenager driving a car from Chicago to San Diego by way of nearly empty Texas roads Schnook picks up a psychotic killer played by Rutger Hauer who adds one more implacable killer to his list of roles Hauer had better start being more selective in his roles or he will lose the aura he had from SOLDIER OF ORANGE and BLADERUNNER From the point he gets picked up Hauer does everything right He is always in just the right place at the right instant It is not long before the police think Poor Schnook is the killer and these are not your ordinary police They have intelligence roughly equivalent to protozoa In a scene we see only the aftermath of Hauer has wiped out an entire police station with apparently no more than a knife In one carefully choreographed scene with one bullet Hauer knocks out one police helicopter and two police cars whose occupants somehow missed seeing the slowly dropping helicopter fall The more destruction there is the more the police want to kill Poor Schnook and the less interested they are in hearing his claims that someone else is responsible The plot of the innocent bystander who gets in over his head is standard thriller stuff and can be well done The innocent bystander against the villain who does everything right is an old one In a sense THE HITCHER has the same basic very basic plot as NORTH BY NORTHWEST but instead of the characters and the wit THE HITCHER gives us just more mindless action scenes Perhaps part of the reason audiences are getting more unruly is that in a film like NORTH BY NORTHWEST you want to hear what the characters are saying while in a film like THE HITCHER it is much less important And one car engine sounds a lot like another Rate this one a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0003,Beyond Therapy,1987,Set in the offices of two psychoanalysts and in a very bad French restaurant BEYOND THERAPY is a love story about two very confused people Bruce Jeff Goldblum and Prudence Julie Haggarty meet through one of many personal ads Bruce has placed They have a disastrous lunch and leave expecting never to see one an other again Of course they do meet again During the course of their relationship we are introduced to Bruce s homosexual roommate lover Bob Bob s theatrical mother Bruce s psychoanalyst and Prudence s psychoanalyst A series of bizarre coincidences puts these six people on a collision course with the hilarious climax BEYOND THERAPY builds momentum slowly The first 45 minutes during which the relationships between the main characters are reveled and expanded are slow sometimes to the point of being tedious About half of the people in the audience walked out during this part of the film But once all the players are lined up in their domino like positions the film delivers a 20 minute punch line worth the wait When the final push comes the characters start to fall and knock each other down with a very satisfying crash
0004,Angel Heart,1987,Starring Mickey Rourke Robert DeNiro Lisa Bonet Charlotte Rampling Directed by Alan Parker Produced by Alan Marshall and Elliott Kastner Executive Producers Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna Screenplay by Alan Parker From the novel Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg Director of Photography Michael Seresin I saw this movie at a special pre release screening here at UCSD Before the movie started there was a trailer stating something to the effect that the version we were seeing was not a finished product and that color editing etc I can t remember the rest may be adjusted We saw the film Saturday night the film is being released on Friday Sidenote can they really make major changes in that short a time The story is set in 1955 and involves a PI Harry Angel Mickey Rourke hired by a mysterious stranger named Louis Cyphre Robert DeNiro to find Johnny Favorite who welshed on a debt he owes Mr Cyphre The only information Angel has is that this man is supposed to be in a hospital in upstate New York unrecovered from a traumatic wartime accident The plot complicates as Angel tracks his man to New Orleans and encounters voodoo magic murder and a surprise ending Unfortunately only part way into the movie I gradually recognized the story as one I had read in a magazine undoubtedly either culled from the book or expanded into a book at a later date While I remember feeling that the story was one of the more interesting and eerie that I had read being privy to the solution of the mystery may have diluted the effect of some of the revelations in the movie I did try and get an unbiased view of the effect of the pacing by talking to my viewing companion afterward who was not aware of the story For this movie to work it is important that the questions lead in a tighter and tighter spiral the tension must mount the pace quicken While there can be occasional minor buildups and releases overall there has to be a heightening sense of mystery and peril On two of these scores the movie succeeds and on one I believe it fails First the screenplay felt tight the clues led ominously to the next one and each one seemed to provide more questions than it answered right up to the slow realization of the solution There were a couple of plot holes but only one truly felt jarring and set near the end it did not detract from the pace In addition the cinematography set a tone that properly framed the action Early on a mood of foreboding pervades the movie and the camera succeeds in capturing a seediness in the environs with drab colors and small details Unfortunately the pace is uneven Certain scenes are dragged out for no obvious reason and several mystery cliches are needlessly added The worst offense is the seemingly obligatory horror scene that turns out to be a dream One other time there is a dream sequence that seems unnecessary but this scene is not so much of a red herring I hope that if they change the film at all it is the use of judicious editing to tighten the film and remove or trim the slow spots In this movie if you have too much time to think the film loses I think this weakness is particularly a shame since director Alan Parker is taking away from nice work by screenwriter Alan Parker I do not know what Alan Parker has previously done Mickey Rourke does a fine job of making Harry Angel an everyman s PI Occasionally he seems to fall too far into the nervous school of acting but his gradual realization of the real story is nicely evoked Lisa Bonet is striking as the sexy worldly young voodoo priestess Robert DeNiro captures the mystery of Louis Cyphre well but Charlotte Rampling is not given enough leeway to play her part of the fortune teller debutante girlfriend of the missing man There is considerable violence and gore in the movie perhaps more than necessary There is also some flesh and sex but not gratuitously I especially think the ending twist is highly imaginative Looking back I think that a good job was done in translating the feel of the story to the screen Overall I would give the movie a high 1 on the Leeper scale of 4 to 4 A better job of editing would give it a solid 2
0005,Angel Heart,1987,Harry Angel played by Mickey Rourke is a hard boiled private eye in the Philip Marlowe tradition He is a little crude a little rude and occasionally a little bit dense His client is Louis Cyphre played by Robert DeNiro a recluse with a silver cane pointed fingernails and like a cipher is something of a mystery to be solved Cyphre hires Angel to track down Johnny Favorite a singer who disappeared twelve years earlier in 1943 Angel follows a trail that has been cold for twelve years through Harlem Poughkeepsie Coney Island and soon to New Orleans The trail will lead from drug addicts to evangelists to voodoo worshipers Harry will trigger a series of murders of friends of Favorite and will become the prime suspect in some of these murders before he discovers the secret of the disappearance of Favorite ANGEL HEART is an interesting variation on the detective stories of the 40s It is as moody a piece as Raymond Chandler would have written probably nearly as suspenseful but it also is a comment on religion We see gospel evangelists squeezing money from their believers we see baptisms for a religion whose primary symbol is as one character describes a man to a wooden cross and we see voodoo rituals with slaughtered chickens Each somehow looks equally ridiculous I doubt that Raymond Chandler would have ever thought to put comparative religion into one of his stories To be perfectly frank my first reaction was to say that this was just a fair detective story and a little bit more and hence would have given the film a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale However thinking back the full solution of the mystery makes a lot of the film even some of its settings seem a lot more interesting The film has a complexity and makes statements not immediately apparent on first viewing On consideration the film does deserve a 2 Oh and as for the film having to have ten seconds of Mickey Rourke shaking his buttocks edited out in order to go from an X to an R rating who cares That ten seconds has become a major topic of interest about the film It has little to do with the main thrust of the film There might not have even been an explicit sex scene if the rating system had not been around Arguing what an R rated film should be and what can only be in a X rated film is like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin And I guess that brings us back to Angels
0006,Radio Days,1987,I ve been a little lax in getting out movie reviews imagine that this is the time to get down to it It s been a Woody Allen kinda week Went and saw RADIO DAYS on Sunday and then HANNAH AND HER SISTERS for the second time I thought HANNAH was probably the best picture I saw last year and my favorite Allen film which is taking in a lot of territory It dispenses a sense of easy good humor among the audience never pushing it and presents situations with a sense of familiarity that would be uncomfortable if handled less capably It has pieces of dialogue that are gut busters accentuated by the low key storyline surrounding them Max Von Sydow s line about Jesus never fails to make me grin like an idiot Finally Allen does something he has yet to do in his previous films he takes his depressed if wry view of life and gives himself and those watching his film an opening at the end of the tunnel or at least a tunnel one can live with Well so much for HANNAH I babbled glowingly about that last year and once is enough I didn t like RADIO DAYS as well but then I didn t like anything I saw last year as much as HANNAH so I guess that s not much of a criticism Good RADIO DAYS isn t as easily likable as HANNAH and it s not going to win the audiences HANNAH did but it s as finely crafted perhaps more so and satisfying in different ways While HANNAH celebrates friends and families as an adult RADIO DAYS is a tribute to nostalgia nostalgia of the family nostalgia of the world and the nostalgia of being a kid ZELIG and THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO have had touches of this before and the short story quality of those movies is found here too the opening sequence about the burglar winning the Name That Tune show from the phone of the house he s broken into but Allen drenches this film with it Not surprisingly though he knows when to hang it out on the line to let it dry using a few straying plotlines about himself various radio characters and his family to string us along With someone else say oh I don t know maybe NEIL SIMON this could get cloying very quickly but Allen managed to turn it around and get me enjoying the film for the same reasons he seemed to enjoy recounting the stories nostalgia When my folks lived in DC during the early 70s several radio stations were playing old shows every night My parents hold the same affection for the radio they grew up with Sky King I Love a Mystery The Lone Ranger as I had for the TV I grew up with Thunderbirds StingRay UFO they managed to pass that on to me and I spent a year listening to radio more than I watched TV I was just past 10 at the time The Lone Ranger was a favorite I always loved how as LR and Tonto were riding off some schmoe would step in and ask Who was that Masked Man anyway This of course gave the poor innocent usually a widow woman lone rancher family grateful sheriff the opportunity to say something incredibly profound in tribute about the Masked Rider of the Plains like He s the man who s made The West safe for men women children and Mormans alike and has given Manifest Destiny a good name again By Golly We used to laugh at it but it was always with affection and I can t help but think that s what Allen is doing here Wally Shawn makes an unlikely Masked Avenger but there s a certain thrill when he shouts Beware Evildoers radio doesn t play through the speaker in the receiver but in your imagination and it allows you to create a scenario just complete enough to have some sense of excitement but private enough that you can laugh at it later On radio Adam West s paunch doesn t lap over Batman s utility belt unless you want it to and space ships aren t Estes models with sparklers stuck out the back Allen s bouts with unreality seem a little more logical in a radio world It s funny in retrospect that Orson Welles name comes up so often in the dialogue of RADIO DAYS Allen could almost be the Welles of the 80s he makes personal quality films under his complete control using a small repertory group of actors over and over again note Tony Roberts is in this one also he seems to be Allen s Talisman at time Oh well whatever works A Mercury Theater for the movies One wonders if he sees the similarities too Anyway Allen continues to produce his yearly snowflake different from the previous film and the next film but with features of both I hope he goes on making them for a long long time Finally if the film has done nothing else for me it s given me something to shout next January 1st other than Happy New Year
0007,Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors A,1987,Yes the inimitable Freddy Kroeger is back in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET PART III THE DREAM WARRIORS In addition to the awkward title the latest nightmare from Wes Craven has a few flaws The Girl from the first film is back and can t act her way through wet tissue But her acting is so bad that it begins to grow on you by the end of the film The only other real problem is that the wires show once or twice too often If you agree that the Nightmare on Elm Street series is the OUT OF AFRICA of slasher films the CASABLANCA of dead teenager flicks then you ll enjoy this trilogy defining sequel Besides learning more about Freddy s genealogy physiology and ontogeny we are treated to an almost endless stream of imaginative effects I mean the practical effects and stop motion animation are well executed and just plain fun Freddy s incarnation as a television set with an enjoyable cameo by Dick Cavett and Eva Gabor and the tongue spouting seductress were particularly original I was also impressed with the clay and skeletal animation Don t worry that it s formula You should enjoy the formula For THE DREAM WARRIORS they pull in almost every snatch of ghostie ghoulie lore in moviedom except thunderstorms and oak stakes Bad acting stilted dialogue shaky plot and all it s still worth seeing especially in a big room full of screaming adolescent females The person I saw it with liked it better than Part II while I think I liked Part II just a little more That should give you a pretty good idea where it rates
0008,Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors A,1987,I really enjoyed the first of these three movies you never knew what was real and what was not and you never knew what was going to happen The idea of making the violence that happened in the dreams actually become real i e you get burned in a dream the burn stays around in real life was the most compelling part of the film But in part two everything got screwed Freddie came out into the real world and thus negated the interesting parts of the story It turned into a simple slasher film with no real interesting parts In fact I didn t manage to stay awake through the second time I saw it Boring But Wes Craven didn t have anything to do with the second film He did with the third I can imagine a situation in which the studio execs came to Wes after the first film and said We ve got a hit here Make another one and Wes said no So they got someone else to write and direct the film Wes saw what atrocities they had committed to his ideas and when they asked for a third film he wanted to regain some of the ideas from the first so he agreed From what I can tell the third film is a true sequel to NIGHTMARE I The ideas contained in the first film are continued the actress playing the lead returns We have an explanation of why Freddie is doing what he does But most importantly it all happens in dreams with the affects of the dreams holding over to real life None off this Freddie comes out of a body to kill people crap The third film nicely ties up the loose ends of the first film Even to some extent explaining the ending It s not as good but it beats all heck out of part II In fact if someone had not seen any of the three I wouldn t bother to suggest that they see part II See one and three and you ve seen the real story
0009,Lethal Weapon,1987,LETHAL WEAPON is a light weight action thriller that quickly degenerates to an extremely stupid movie While a detective whose name I don t remember is investigating the murder of a friend s daughter he and his new partner Riggs a suicidal burned out ex Vietnam sniper stumble onto a heroin ring This movie is so loaded with cliches ex CIA men turned to crime a tough looking guy holding his arm in a flame to prove his loyalty to Fearless Leader kidnapped daughters and so on that there is no room left for any genuine suspense What is left is an adventure movie with no guts or heart If you look hard for something worthwhile in this movie there is a vague chemistry between Glover and Gibson that provides a couple of good laughs But that chemistry is erratic at best and doesn t come close to saving the film
0010,Lethal Weapon,1987,This is a police thriller in the tradition of 48 HOURS and THE FRENCH CONNECTION It s taut well executed and not entirely predictable It comes to us from Richard Donner of SUPERMAN fame who is noted for his interest in characterization and making the characters seem real and believable to the audience despite their often superhuman abilities In SUPERMAN this took the form of an alien with amazing super powers In LETHAL WEAPON this takes the form of Martin Riggs Mel Gibson whose incredible prowess with any kind of firearm as well as his proficiency of a number of martial arts make him the lethal weapon to whom the title refers He also spends some of his evenings alone in his motor home mourning over his dead wife and deciding whether or not he should join her He is what one could call a cop on the edge He is paired with Roger Murtholdt Danny Glover who is a family man celebrating his fiftieth birthday The idea of pairing two opposites is by no means a new one especially in police stories but Donner pulls it off well Both characters are basically likable Neither pull a lot of comedic one liners or fit any stereotypical cop roles Murtholdt sp Glover s character has a kind of presence simply due to his stature coupled with his natural soft spoken style Gibson s character is so interesting because we never know for sure whether or not he is as insane as Glover as well as the police psychologist seem to believe He certainly does well as a killing machine claiming that killing is the only thing he could ever do well As a thriller the movie is nearly flawless There are few slow scenes one in a firing range where the two are discussing a case seemed to drag a bit The plot is interesting and not as predictable as some reviewers have claimed True the idea of having ex CIA men going BAD and smuggling drugs is not a new one but it s used well in this film and provides some interesting interplay between the good guys and the bad guys The action scenes are on the whole extremely well executed I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie In short this film is a must see for anyone at all interested in the present rage of killer cop and angry soldier movies this Spring and also for those who aren t interested but like action Credit is also due to Gary Busey who turns in a fine performance as a psychopathic Vietnam vet he s good at playing crazies and to Tom Atkins as Glover s old war buddy whose daughter stars in one of the most stimulating opening scenes I have ever seen
0011,Bedroom Window The,1987,Capsule review In the best film thriller I have seen in a while Steve Guttenberg pretends to have witnessed a crime his paramour actually saw Before long he is swept into an ever worsening vortex of trouble and danger I recently gave a fairly negative review to an attempted nightmarish thriller THE HITCHER The plot of that is one of a teenager driving cross country who picks up a psychotic hitchhiker and spends the rest of the movie fighting this creep who always does just the right thing who has super human strength and who apparently has the ability to cloud the minds of officers of the law Several people commented that they found it a very tense film and one asked me what more I wanted from a thriller I just saw a film that has some superficial similarities to THE HITCHER but does just about everything right that I thought THE HITCHER did wrong The film is THE BEDROOM WINDOW and it does right nearly everything that I thought THE HITCHER did wrong Steve Guttenberg plays a young executive at a Baltimore construction company who has a short affair with his boss s wife From his bedroom window she witnesses an assault on a woman on the street below Leter that evening another woman is murdered nearby Sylvia the boss s wife cannot report what she saw to the police without her husband finding out about the affair so she describes the assailant to Guttenberg and he tells the police that it was he who saw the crime This begins a chain of events that start out simply inconvenient for Guttenberg but get worse and worse eventually achieving truly nightmarish proportions THE BEDROOM WINDOW unlike THE HITCHER has genuine characters with motivation and personalities The killer when finally discovered is far more exciting as a character than is Rutger Hauer in THE HITCHER because he is real and makes mistakes Guttenberg s desperation is also effective and believable because while he rarely does the smartest thing he could do the character always has good reasons for what he does As a side note the action of the film takes Guttenberg to the fells Point Saloon which might well be a tip of the hat to Guttenberg s first major role in DINER That film took place at the Fells Point Diner THE BEDROOM WINDOW has characters the audience cares about getting into believable messes I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0012,Belizaire the Cajun,1986,Capsule review Mark Twain esque tale of murder and bigotry set in 1859 in Louisiana Armand Assante plays a clever Cajun healer trying to protect his cousin and the whole Cajun community from local rednecks This is an engrossing and enjoyable film that tells its story without any wrong moves Recommended Every once in a while one of the cable stations runs what they call a find That is they run a little known film that got almost no theatrical play but is a good film anyway Actually little known may not be quite accurate since almost always the cable finds have been previously reviewed usually favorably on one or the other of TV s review programs Well I guess in the same sense I can claim BELIZAIRE THE CAJUN as a find of sorts It seems to me that I had heard it recommended but it sounded kind of artsy and dull The last thing I was expecting was a fun film It takes about five minutes to get into the southern and Cajun accents and the occasional lapsing into French What can I say I m slow After that I was enjoying the film too much to let any of that get in my way In southwestern Louisiana in 1859 the men of the upper class are joining together in a vigilante committee the forerunner of the Ku Klux Klan to frighten the local Cajun population into leaving the territory Not yet threatened and for now perhaps the best liked of the Cajuns is Belizaire a healer a fast thinker and a real character But Belizaire s cousin has been given a writ of exile by the vigilantes and Belizaire is quickly being pulled into the fray In a story worthy of Mark Twain in fact reminiscent in some ways of PUDDIN HEAD WILSON we have a story about an ethnic group rarely seen in films yet a story that will be meaningful to every minority and should be enjoyable by just about anyone Admittedly I do not know much about Cajun culture but a viewer can generally tell when a film seems authentic and this one seems to have been very well researched Perhaps that is partially due to having Robert Duvall as creative consultant Duvall who incidentally appears in a cameo has an extremely good ear for accents and is reputed to be a real stickler for accuracy With a feel of accuracy and a good piece of story telling BELIZAIRE THE CAJUN is a find worth looking for at your local video store Rate it 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0013,Hombre mirando al sudeste,1986,Capsule review A serious science fiction film from Argentina has a psychiatrist faced with a Christ like patient who claims to be an alien This is a film with a lot to say about psychiatry hunger charity and religion With that much to say it is perhaps over ambitious It does not do everything right but what is right is worth seeing Argentina is not one of the countries one generally expects to be making science fiction films It has had a film industry for quite a long time as anyone who has heard EVITA knows but their films seem rarely seem to get international play and do not seem to have much fantasy in any case Yet Argentina has a heritage of literary fantasy led until his recent death by Jorge Luis Borges Borges s influence can be felt in a new fantasy science fiction film from Argentina MAN FACING SOUTHEAST The film combines elements of THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST The main character of MAN FACING SOUTHEAST is a psychiatrist in an insane asylum Dr Denis is disturbed by his inability to really help his patients and by the asylum s callous and factory like treatment of patients One patient s fantasy incidentally is an uncredited enactment of the painting The Lovers by Magritte But a new patient appears at the asylum one day committing himself It is Rantes s apparent delusion that he is an extra terrestrial sent to Earth on a mission He commits himself voluntarily because he knows society would only commit him more forcibly if he did not Rantes sees the suffering and pain around him and the selfishness of the comfortable In a number of scenes he turns the tables But Dr Denis is the real center of the story Facing pressure to drug Rantes out of what may or may not be an illusion actually the audience knows which but the doctor does not Denis sees himself as Pontius Pilate being forced to crucify another Jesus As more patients at the asylum become disciples of Rantes the pressures increase on the bewildered psychiatrist to fulfill his role as the later day Pilate MAN FACING SOUTHEAST is an intelligent science fiction film that needs no special effects It is at once a cry of social despair a philosophical essay and a science fiction story If anything it tries to be too much and spreads itself too thin often it gives way to cliche Yet in many ways it is comparable to THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT and if the Argentine industry follows the same path the British did we can hope to see a lot more good films from it in the future Rate MAN FACING SOUTHEAST a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0014,Tin Men,1987,Capsule review Chronicle of two aluminum siding salesmen s personal and self destructive feud is often very funny sometimes serious but always engrossing This is a well made comedy drama by the director of DINER and THE NATURAL Barry Levinson is quite a good director with films to his name like CATHOLICS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL DINER and THE NATURAL His latest film which he wrote and directed is TIN MEN a new comedy from Touchstone Films who seem to be able to turn out a film really worth seeing every month or so They still have OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE playing in theaters and they have followed it up with TIN MEN a much more serious comedy perhaps even a comedy drama The film stars two members of the Touchstone repertory company Richard Dreyfus and Danny DeVito TIN MEN is a study in childishness selfishness and mania BB Dreyfus and Tilley DeVito are both tin men Tin men is slang for aluminum siding salesman and like the origin of the name tin men these men really have no heart As director Levinson shows the business and he should know his father was a tin man selling aluminum siding is sleazy enough to make professional wrestling seem honest and forthright by comparison BB and Tilley have a car accident damaging each of their Cadillacs and before long they are totally consumed with the lust for revenge At first the war is funny sometimes very much so But soon it is clear that neither man cares about who is hurt along the way any more than either man cares who is hurt by their business ethics The government is investigating and closing down salesmen with disreputable business practices and the days of BB s and Tilley s flim flamming customers are soon to come to an end But their hatred of each other because they are so similar seems to be the only thing on each tin man s mind Levinson s ear for dialogue is superb Conversations he throws in are often more interesting than the plot He has carefully re created the Baltimore of 1962 just as he did for DINER With TIN MEN he has created two memorable if not likable characters and an entire world to put them in Rate this a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Not up to DINER or THE NATURAL but a quality film nonetheless
0016,Wizard of Oz The,1939,Most viewers see THE WIZARD OF OZ as merely a children s film or as a fantasy that entertains without edifying This is probably due to Baum s and Fleming s subtlety since in reality the film is an intense philosophical statement Consider for example Fleming s use of color Reality to Fleming is drab and colorless only the world of our dreams has life and color to it i e the belief that the self is the only reality in cinematic terms Dorothy is not so much using her dreams to allow herself to fit into reality as she is discovering that reality exists only in her dreams The characters that Dorothy meets in her dream which is in turn her reality are symbolic characters and her journey represents a rite of passage to adulthood Her three companions for example represent the three facets of her person intellectual emotional and spiritual Throughout the film we see fertility symbols which represent her transition from child to woman Although Baum s Dorothy was only six years old it is evident that Fleming s Dorothy is twelve or thirteen The ruby slippers which are forced upon her are obviously a symbol of menstruation particularly since the slippers in Baum s book were silver And the menace of the witch in the cyclone is emphasized by the use of the broom an obvious phallic symbol Dorothy has reached an age where womanhood and its consequences are frightening and her dreams reflect this Again and again we see symbols of her passage to womanhood the corn field the apples representing the fruit of the harvest as well as the Biblical concept of original sin In addition we see her confusion symbolized by the long tunnel in the Wizard s palace which she travels UP in an obvious attempt to return to the womb and escape her problems As was stated before her three companions represent the three aspects of her person The Scarecrow is the embodiment of Dorothy s realization that she must develop and use her intellectual abilities to a much greater extent as an adult that she needed to as a child The Tin Man represents Dorothy s emotional growth She eventually through the character of the Tin Man comes to realize and accept her emotional side even with the dangers that such acceptance entails The Cowardly Lion is the manifestation of Dorothy s spiritual growth her belief in herself if you prefer Dorothy realizes that she must become more secure in herself if she is to pass from childhood to adulthood That Dorothy is undergoing a rite of passage is stressed in several smaller ways The hourglass for example represents the inexorable passing of time Dorothy must leave her childhood behind whether she wants to or not Note also that when she tries to give up the ruby slippers i e womanhood she is unable to again pointing up the impossibility of retreating to childhood again Also though she wishes to remain in the Emerald City which like the rest of Munchkinland is populated by children she must leave its safety if she is ever to pass to adulthood The famous jitterbugging scene which was cut from the film prior to release presumably because it would have dated the film in a few years would have stressed this transition even more The Wicked Witch before sending her flying monkeys to kidnap Dorothy says that she will send something before them to take the fight out of Dorothy The following scene which was cut showed Dorothy and her companions being bitten by jitterbugs whose poison caused them to dance until exhausted But the jitterbug as a dance is very similar to many primitive dances which represent the frenzy of the sexual act Hence here we have Dorothy threatened by symbolic rape Given the moral climate of the time it is not surprising that the scene was cut Dorothy s fourth companion in the film is Toto her dog Since toto is Latin for all we can interpret him as representing the totality of Dorothy s personality the union of the three aspects Using this interpretation we realize that Fleming has given us a dream within a dream further emphasizing the solipsism inherent in the film For if we interpret Dorothy s trip through Oz as a dream in which she i e her personality is separated from her physical body then Toto s escape from the witch s castle represents the ultimate core of her self departing from the imperfections of her personality s various aspects The original conflict recall was the attempted destruction of Dorothy s all or Toto Just as beneath the physical layer there is a spiritual layer so beneath the spiritual layer there is yet a third more essential layer Only when Dorothy is in harmony with the three aspects of her personality i e when she is reunited with the Scarecrow the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion can she attain her ultimate self i e be joined again with Toto So we see that far from a meaningless fantasy THE WIZARD OF OZ is in fact a deep philosophical statement which causes us to reflect on the harmony or disharmony of the aspects of our own personalities
0017,Evil Dead II,1987,Capsule review There s more budget than logic to this stringing together of off beat and semi humorous horror scenes Creative visual concepts abound and the pace is frenetic and that makes up for a multitude of sins I guess in some sense THE EVIL DEAD II is the ultimate horror film sort of I guess Well what can I say It does not have much of a plot It has very little acting no stars little continuity and no logic But it has action horror and black humor in massive doses Now THE EVIL DEAD II did have some plot It was not it s strong suit but it was there What THE EVIL DEAD boasted most was wit An attacking corpse would be thrown into the fire Then some living person would have a bout of remorse and pull it out of the fire The corpse would look up and politely thank its benefactor for pulling it out of the fire then continues to try and kill the living I guess there is some wit in a scene like that and some willingness to experiment with the horror medium The sequel is one strange semi horror scene after another The plot is that some professor of some sort has translated the Necronomicon of H P Lovecraft fame He recorded an incantation on tape and now whenever anyone plays the tape it s Anything Can Happen Day A young couple find the cabin and think it might be an ideal trysting place Most of one of them is left the next night when the professor s daughter shows up with a friend and two rather strange locals By that point we have already seen a beheaded corpse climb out of the ground and do a charming dance with its head We ve seen a lot more than that but that would be telling And we will see a whole lot more but that too would be telling The actors of this piece were I think chosen for the terrorized looks they could get on their faces and for how ghoulish they could make themselves look The script is incredibly contrived including such touches as having a bridge that would have cost in the millions that leads to nowhere but a shack in the woods I didn t think boondoggles got that big For those who like gore and creative off beat horror this one s for you As a fan of the latter though not of the former particularly I will give this a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale If you like the bizarre give it a try
0018,Raising Arizona,1987,I was a big fan of Joel and Ethan Coen s first film Blood Simple I m not sure if it s accurate to say that their new film Raising Arizona is precisely a disappointment but it certainly isn t at all what I expected and I didn t really like it Raising Arizona is such a peculiar movie that I find it difficult to analyze my own feelings about it In some sense that itself is a sort of recommendation since I m a believer in trying to have unusual film experiences but I can t help but come back to the fact that I didn t really like it The story is moderately peculiar to begin with A lower class Arizona couple discover that they can t have a baby Adoption is out as the husband is a five or six time loser specializing in robbing convenience stores with an unloaded gun When they hear of the birth of a set of quintuplets they set out to steal one of them for their own Raising Arizona just starts from here throwing in vast numbers of complicating factors and extraneous vignettes It s safe to say that the screenplay is rather different from the run of the mill Hollywood script or any other type of script that actually gets made The Coen brothers who wrote the script and then split directing and producing chores Joel doing the former Ethan the latter have taken this odd substrate and layered on further levels of weirdness The characters are strange the direction is unusual the cinematography gratuitously inventive and the overall effect more stupefying than anything else I m not really sure if Raising Arizona came out the way the Coen brothers intended but it certainly doesn t work Perhaps the plan was to create an overall atmosphere so bizarre as to carry the film on that basis alone Unfortunately the different elements tend to work against each other rather than demonstrating the internal consistency necessary to carry such a plan off Not to say that Raising Arizona is without its merits There are several funny moments a nicely choreographed chase scene and Nicholas Cage playing the husband known as H I pronounced just as you would expect gives an excellent performance His character is a dimwitted rube who s not very strong on honesty but Cage makes him lovable rather like a large stupid dog whose misdeeds are so inept as to make you feel sorry for him Cage s greatest achievement is that he makes H I seem like a real person a feat beyond the rest of the cast Everyone else is a caricature and somehow Raising Arizona needed more of a foot in the real world More realistic portrayals might have overcome the sense that the Coens view not just these characters but the whole level of society they represent with condescension and contempt Particularly unfortunate is Holly Hunter s shrill and shallow performance as the wife If both of the leading characters had been real people then supporting them with a cast of stick figures might have worked out But Hunter brings very little to her part other than a few good line readings In particular she doesn t show a strong enough maternal instinct to convince us of the necessity of all the random mayhem that follows Randall Tex Cobb stands out among the supporting cast as an extremely nasty bounty hunter And the babies of course are very cute The cinematography by Barry Sonnenfield is breathtaking yet inappropriate In Blood Simple every flashy camera move reinforced the scene Here the wild antics of the camera seem beside the point as if they were created almost without regard for what is going on in the film They are worth seeing simply because they re so audacious but they add little to the film Carter Burwell s music on the other hand does seem to capture some of the tone that the film strives for If there s one thing wrong with Raising Arizona it s a lack of sympathy The Coens don t seem to care about any of their characters except as the butts of jokes Really effective slapstick depends on the audience caring about the disaster befalling the characters but if the filmmakers don t care about them the audience won t either The Coens made Raising Arizona with too much brains and too little heart Blood Simple was all thought and no emotion too but the thriller genre is inherently more cerebral than comedy Good comedy comes from the gut and the heart only secondarily from the brain Given its immense uncertainty of tone I d have to rate Raising Arizona as a failure overall But it is a very different type of failure than the typical film Raising Arizona is an imaginative failure a failure caused by an attempt to do more than the filmmakers were able to do That may not be the same thing as success but it s more interesting than some films that achieve everything they set out to do For those looking for something different than the average film Raising Arizona is worth seeing
0019,Raising Arizona,1987,The Coen brothers have made another movie Two years ago the then 29 year old director Joel and the then 26 year old producer Ethan made a superb story of murder and misunderstanding BLOOD SIMPLE was a great first film and all the more amazing for having come from two unknowns Joel had been editor on some low budget horror films the best known of which was THE EVIL DEAD Ethan had no film experience BLOOD SIMPLE was a great film and an outstanding critical success More recently the Coens had to prove that they had more than just one film in them Well RAISING ARIZONA proves that and while it seems less ambitious to make one more comedy in a market full of comedies RAISING ARIZONA is as unique in its own way as BLOOD SIMPLE was Nicholas Cage plays H I an ex con who went through jail terms as often as you go through tubes of toothpaste Then he married Edwina an ex cop who wants to settle down with him and raise a family One problem No kids And as a cigar chomping doctor gaily explains there aren t gonna be none neither Things look pretty bad until Edwina hears about a furniture chain Trey Wilson who played in FX and as the base commander in A SOLDIER S STORY owner whose wife just had quintuplets Now if some folks don t got enough kids and others got too many the answer is obvious If H I s so used to stealing Well you get the idea And what the Coens give us a bringing up baby sort of comedy done in a manic Joe Bob Briggs style I think while he was making this film the cameraman must have lived on black coffee and motion sickness pills In fact the same might be true of most of the major actors The Coens have a way of telling a story that is fast and staccato The camera moves in fast jerky motions making the viewer feel as manic as the characters The film grinds up biker movies the prison system other people s kids the parents of other people s kids and just about anything else that gets in its path The film is fast and it s funny And it s not like most of the other comedies out there Rate this one a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0020,Raising Arizona,1987,Alright new approach I liked RAISING ARIZONA Laughed throughout it Wanted to write down quotes from it this film has enough for three movie quizzes in it Absolutely the best zany film to come along in two years and the finest slapstick I ve seen since THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY But I came out realizing that I knew a lot of people who weren t going to like this So rather than review the film listing the aspects that make the film appealing I m running through points which might dissuade a viewer from enjoying this film WARM HUMAN COMEDY This isn t the Huxtables here folks This isn t even Woody Allen s family in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS The Coens writer directors of RAISING ARIZONA are not trying to have you leave the theater imagining how pleasant it would be to have dinner with the protagonists having dinner with H I and his wife and their house guests would probably be the most dangerous social visit of your entire lifetime However these characters have a movie screen between them and us and this certainly allows the viewer a certain emotional distance i e you can laugh your ass off about what happens to them We re going for yoks here rude yoks satirical yoks farcical yoks and just plain gut busting Friday night yoks If your diet requires some emotional attachment to the main characters say more than 30 then perhaps you should skip it However if you re a comedy mercenary giving no quarter and taking none this is meat potatoes UNDERSTATED COMEDY Really like subtlety in your humor eh Prefer the understated symbolic approach to comedy Have an oil portrait of Noel Coward hanging in your library Better avoid RAISING ARIZONA like the plague Not that the humor is crude it s not As a person who believes that the world would be a far better place if every print of PORKY S and its sequels were buried in a Hanford nuclear waste site I am in opposition of stupid humor as much as the next mutant The jokes here are not stupid but their not wearing much in the way of formal wear either They re not going to politely knock on your door and ask if they can borrow your expensive brown mustard they re going to trudge in through the back door grab a beer out of the fridge and sprawl out over the couch And you re going to be happy they did unless you re picky about these sort of things JET PLANES WITH ACCOMPANYING ROCK MUSIC No sorry no jet planes in this film Some of the characters do talk like Goose though DON T FIND BABIES OR PEOPLE WITH THICK SW ACCENTS AMUSING Gosh I m not one of those people you see in the Magic Mushrooms commercials but I have to admit that the lil tykes in this flick are just Gosh Darned cute And I do find those accents amusing I m from Iowa and no one ever saw fit to give ME an accent Well nobody ever said life was going to be fair HATE SLAPSTICK Well considering how much bad slapstick there are in movies today I can understand your reservation However this is really good slapstick There is a 10 minute chase scene in the middle of this film which should be used to teach both chase scene dynamics and visual joke telling Absolutely wonderful CAN T STAND TO HEAR BACH PLAYED ON A BANJO Look if Bach hasn t complained about it what are you bitching about
0021,Lethal Weapon,1987,LETHAL WEAPON tends to be one of those marginal on the border films its qualities and weaknesses are glaring and tend to cancel one another out The story which is nothing special centers on an aging family man police detective Danny Glover who is saddled with a series of drug related crimes and a new partner who is rumored to have a death wish Mel Gibson Together they begin to track down the men behind a multi million dollar drug smuggling operation which is complicated when members of Glover s family become hostages for the hoods With almost anyone else playing the main roles this would have been a major failure but Glover and Gibson begin a relationship that somehow transcends the dialogue they ve been given or at least transmutes it into something believable They form a symbiosis that the movie was no doubt shooting for Glover and family providing Gibson with something to care about and an emotional base after the death of his wife and Gibson providing Glover with a lean mean crazy machine who can kill like nobody s business But it s not due to the script it s almost as if the two actors pull their characters over their heads and disappear into them To my mind Gibson is probably the two or three actors in Hollywood who really fits as an action adventure hero Eastwood s too old Bronson was never any good to begin with Stallone too lifeless Norris too stupid and Harrison Ford looks too much like John Fogerty But Gibson he provides something behind the eyes to make you think he re ally might be a psycho yet he gains sympathy in an early scene where he almost eats his gun I loved the sequence where they break out through the disco Gibson pulls a nonchalant rap as he blows away the three or four goons between himself and the door to rec arts comics readers yeah the parallels between the character and The Badger are really phenomenal He and Glover are very comfortable in these roles I remember halfway into this hoping their would be a sequel it d be a great basis for a TV series but no way would you get Gibson into it On the other hand there s the plot It may not be as inept or as improbable as COBRA or INVASION USA but the rest of the film is good enough to make the accompanying story jarring in comparison Ridiculous plot element is heaped on to ridiculous plot element the two cops are invited up to a Beverly Hills home of one of the key figures in the drug organization where an assassination attempt is made the police aren t going to make the connection if their two detectives disappear during their visit Fire fights break out in the most unlikely places The kidnapping of Glover s daughter makes sense and she does act as I imagine any average 16 year old girl would when faced by such a dilemma she gets hysterical but by the end it s almost a pastiche of the Helpless Female role And nothing absolutely nothing could justify the anti climatic fight scene between Gibson and Gary Busey the albino crazed henchman Pure unadulterated dumb I ve tried to come up with a thumbs up thumbs down rating for this but my mind changes every few hours Let s put it this way it averages out to a C but the standard deviation is HUGE
0022,Hollywood Shuffle,1987,With HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE first time writer director Robert Townsend creates a very entertaining film This good natured parody of movie making gets most of its laughs from gentle but well aimed shots at the stereotypes connected to black actors and white film makers Along the way HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE takes time out to lampoon hard boiled detectives Eddie Murphy TV movie critics and the rewards of stardom Townsend also stars as Bobby a struggling young black actor who works part time at the local Winky Dinky Dog hot dog stand Bobby is trying out for his first movie role playing a street hood named Jivetime Jimmy Unfortunately while Bobby hopes this part will put him on the road to stardom he also feels the role is so absurdly unrealistic in its portrayal of blacks that to take the part would be selling out his integrity The best scenes in HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE take place in Bobby s mind as he daydreams and images the consequences of his actions The tone of these scenes ranges from a dry Pythonisque humor to absurd visual humor that would be at home in one of the Airplane movies With the exception of Bobby s family and girlfriend the other characters are caricatures of actors producers and hog dog vendors but these caricatures are not presented in a mean spirited way You are left with the feeling that Townsend is spoofing the stereotypes not poking fun at the people associated with the stereotypes An intelligent comedy and an effective parody HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE rates a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0023,Blind Date,1987,Walter has a problem He needs a date for a dinner party being thrown for one of his firms biggest clients His regular girlfriend has stood him up at the last minute and now he s desperate Walter finally accepts a blind date with Nadia a friend of his sister in law and ignoring the warnings of his sister in law allows her to drink After all Nadia is a charming and beautiful woman What harm could come from sharing one bottle of champagne Unfortunately no one told Walter that Nadia is a hopeless dipsomaniac who after just one drink gains the destructive force of a tornado Walter of course has a miserable night Over the next 6 hours he is the butt of every slapstick gag known In addition to being mugged jailed and fired he ends up in love and responsible for saving Nadia from the plotting of her unscrupulous ex fiance BLIND DATE has everything you would expect from a Blake Edwards movie except Julie Andrews The dialogue is funny the slapstick is funny and the pacing is good For high concept comedy it s pretty good but there are several problems At first Bruce Willis struggles against his David Adison image playing Walter as a disorganized portfolio analyst with no style or social skills but then falls into his Moonlighting persona Kim Bassinger gives a good performance as Nadia but the role requires that she only behave drunkenly and then helpless so there isn t much room for depth It also has the one hundredth movie dog named Rambo this year and several running jokes that quickly become stale and predictable
0024,Blind Date,1987,Blake Edwards has been making comedies for a long time He may be best known for the Inspector Clouseau films that starred Peter Sellers Edwards has turned out a comedy every year or so since the mid Fifties and since the early Seventies he has made little but comedies Many of his comedies have been uproariously funny like THE PARTY but in my opinion he is having some trouble keeping up the level of his humor and his comedies work nowhere nearly as well as they once did Edwards seems to be running out of ideas and his films seem to have less and less care lavished on each BLIND DATE has the feel of an hour long script padded mostly at the end to be a full length film Like INTO THE NIGHT and AFTER HOURS BLIND DATE is the story of how much can go wrong with someone s life in the course of a single night After the story of that night BLIND DATE finds itself with no story to tell and no place to go The rest is just sort of tacked on Walter Davis played by Bruce Willis is a financial executive who needs to find a date to take to a business dinner Against his better judgement he allows his brother to fix him up with a woman he has never met To his surprise she doesn t look like the underside of a rock In fact Nadia played by Kim Basinger is a knock out Then he makes his big mistake Against the advice of his brother and Nadia s own reluctance he gives her a drink of champagne From that point on Pandora s Box has been opened and Walter s life would never be the same again There are perhaps two scenes that actually work in this film the rest of the film just frames those scenes and not particularly imaginatively Through much of the film people act in totally unexplainable ways on the weak script excuse that they are drunk so not themselves Often the script doesn t even make that much sense One character spends a good part of the film driving though store fronts The police never stop him and his car sustains only minor damages These days some very good comedies are coming out with the current TIN MEN RAISING ARIZONA and perhaps OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE as prime examples If Edwards is going to trade off of his name and do as slipshod a job as this he will soon have to hang it up For the sake of a couple of scenes that do work rate this one a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0025,Toxic Avenger The,1985,Capsule review This is a feeble parody on super hero comics that seems to have a following purely because it knocks New Jersey It has crude production values weak humor and an inexplicable following Generally I am not all that fond of parodies A film gets no points just for being a parody no matter what it is satirizing A parody should be funny on its own even if the viewer has never seen the material being parodied One parody that does work is John Landis s first film a satire on TROG called SCHLOCK The gags in SCHLOCK are funny even if you have never seen TROG One parody that does not make it for this very reason is THE TOXIC AVENGER Melvin Furd a name borrowed from MAD magazine satires of the 1950s is a 98 pound weakling working as a mop boy at a health club in Tromaville New Jersey the self styled Toxic Capital of the World At the club everyone is good looking and is a creep in one way or another and the favorite sport is tormenting Melvin One such prank goes awry and lands Melvin in a vat of toxic waste which puts Melvin through some changes He becomes incredibly strong like Arnold Schwarzenegger but at the same time he is made deformed and ugly like well Arnold Schwarzenegger He then proceeds to set the world or at least Tromaville right The problem is that most of the jokes in THE TOXIC AVENGER are feeble and predictable The jokes are on the level of the health instructor telling his exercise class to do just what he does and then someone drops a snake down his back You ve seen this gag about thirty times before The film is crudely made with the words often not synchronized with the lips THE TOXIC AVENGER is a funny film for anyone who can laugh for an hour and a half at the same joke premise with little assistance from the rest of an amateurish script Yes we all like to knock New Joisey and none more than we New Joisey residents but THE TOXIC AVENGER doesn t do it particularly creatively Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0026,Burglar,1987,I hate having to echo Siskel Ebert but something has to be done about getting Whoopi Goldberg some decent scripts Her latest film BURGLAR once again tantalizes us with brief glimpses of potential but smothers it under ridiculous plotting and inadequate backup from supporting characters The fact that I left the movie liking Goldberg s character DESPITE some of the lines situations that had been fed to her says what kind of actress she is she has a lot of charisma A cinematic natural resource if you please But she keeps getting into these half baked projects like this and JUMPIN JACK FLASH which end up making me distraught because while giving some degree of satisfaction they consistently reminded me how good they COULD HAVE BEEN with a little work in the script department BURGLAR is an adaptation of Lawrence Block s Burglar books specifically The Burglar in the Closet I ve read most of these books I d give them a C average so I my be more sensitive to anomalies in the script that those who have not read these books In some bizarre twist the sex of the majority of the characters in the book has been changed Bernie Rhodenbarr sp the burglar has gone from a he to a she Whoopi Goldberg his lesbian friend and neighbor has become a male heterosexual flake Bob Goldwaith the dentist who has hired Bernie to ransack his wife s apartment has become Leslie Ann Warren and the wife has become a husband Actually it works pretty well especially Goldberg with the exception being Goldwaith whose character has to be one of the most annoying to appear on the screen in years If you disliked the old Saturday Night Live characters The Whiners you re going to HATE Goldwaith in this film How did Goldwaith get here Personal friend of the producers Of Goldberg s Did she marry him I understand she recently got married You keep wondering why someone as together as Goldberg s Rhodenbarr is hanging out with this nebbish Other characters who don t work very well are G W Bailey s crooked cop who was generally fairly friendly in the book but here often acts like a savage Warren overacts which is her standard modus operandi these days as far as I can tell The rest of the cast is forgetable I really wish I knew what the scriptwriters were trying to do the plot of this movie is absolutely schizoid On one hand it seems to be trying to do a fairly accurate adaptation of the film despite the sex changes et al and then suddenly it goes for a car chase or some action sequences which really don t work with the rest of the movie It s not a terrible script but it is blazingly awkward consistently stumbling when you were just getting interested in what s going on Throughout it Whoopi Goldberg plays Bernie Rhodenbarr into an interesting level headed character actually more appealing than the burglar in the books in my mind There are points where even she can t overcome the script her having to consistently rattle off the spiel about how she only robs people who deserve it you expect her to jump up on a rock and give an Errol Flynn speech about robbing from the rich to give to the poor And she does go into Whoopi Goldberg schticks on occasion but many of them fit into the character of the burglar so it works I especially liked the Italian game show host as she examines the dentist s husband s closet But over all she plays a self assured in charge character you really get to like by the end of the film She also is the only heroine since Sigourney Weaver in ALIENS that I can remember who saves the day and brings in the criminal herself without any help from a man Wish we d see more of that End result A film that is marginally watchable and constantly shows potential that it never lives up to Dammit Whoopi get a new agent
0027,Hoosiers,1986,HOOSIERS is the first sports movie since THE NATURAL that I ve liked and maybe that s not surprising After ROCKY came out there were about fifty billion sports underdog films out most of them pretty poor track field gymnastics kung fu even bowling But I ve always found both basketball and baseball to be the two romantic American sports the two sports where a group of people work together as a unit to accomplish a goal where the disparate personalities are fused into a team Baseball tends to be also blend in a generous touch of nostalgia basketball with its speed and precision is the other Football to me is just too hyped and too violent to qualify for the designation But I digress This is a beautiful film to watch David Anspaugh directs and if I remember correctly he has been responsible for some of the best TV of the last decade I particularly remember an old Lou Grant episode that I believe Anspaugh was involved with where Lou returns home to a small mid western town for a relative s funeral The show had atmosphere and Anspaugh has brought it back threefold for HOOSIERS The overcast skies the tree lined streets the leaves over everything the small high school Anspaugh s eye for detail sets the stage perfectly for the story The story isn t anything new a new basketball coach Gene Hackman arrives in a very small Indiana town Hickory in the early 50 s and begins to mold a champion high school basketball team despite a variety of obstacles including his own rather mysterious past A phenomenally gifted boy who is being pressured to play a young teacher Barbera Hershey who resents the importance of basketball a colorful drunkard Dennis Hopper in a delightful role who Hackman wants as an assistant coach despite the differences between Hopper and his son who is on the team and the inevitable Monday Morning Quarterbacks who played basketball as boys and think the coach is screwing up Almost all of these subplots work what they lack in originality they make up in the skill in which they are resolved The only thing I found somewhat awkward was Hershey s rather sudden romance with Hackman but that is a minor detail The story keeps you interested throughout and while the conclusion could well be anti climatic even this seems to fit in well with the story Hackman s conflict between playing the game to win and playing the game for sake of playing seems to be the real dramatic theme of the film and when it is resolved you tend to worry a lot less about who wins The Big Game it s not whether you win but how you play Certainly next to Anspaugh s name on the kudos list must be Hackman Someone once said that Gene Hackman was the only actor he d ever seen who looks like you could invite him over for a beer and enjoy the experience I can t think of another actor today who has the skills AND looks enough like a basketball coach to pull this off Hackman doesn t surprise me in doing it he s done too much good work but he certainly deserves credit all the same The actors playing the basketball players also deserve credit because not once did I think of them as anything but high school basketball players and small town kids to boot It is another factor that makes the illusion of Hickory almost seamless Dennis Hopper adds just the right touch of eccentricity and humor to the film though his scene with his character s son deserves credit I don t think I d argue with his Academy Award nomination for this film though many friends have told me he really deserved something for BLUE VELVET And finally Jerry Goldsmith turns in another award winning score Horner is derivative Rozsa hardly does anything any more and John Williams seems to have burned out but Jerry Goldsmith has turned out original effective and memorable scores for the last thirty years Here s hoping he and we will have thirty more years of his work A substantively entertaining movie perfect for a rainy afternoon
0028,Lily Tomlin,1986,First of all I wish to separate myself from Enquiring Minds Want To Know critics who went to this film hoping to see rumors come to life on the screen I refuse to say things like What this film is really about is what the film will not show us and about what Lily didn t want the filmmakers to reveal Instead I will focus on what the film shows us and I will leave the gossip mongering to the tabloids The name of the film is LILY TOMLIN It is a twenty month voyage of exploration and experimentation Very little of the film was staged for filming and that part was done beside Lily s pool Lily sits in her Edith Ann sized chair and fidgets at being interviewed The impression these scenes left me with is that she is a private person who doesn t like to be asked to perform When Lily performs onstage it is because she wants to be there However when someone puts her in a chair and says What would Ernestine say about this i e Do that voice for us she understandably feels pressured Mercifully these scenes are few and brief When they go backstage the filmmakers ask questions at inappropriate times like between acts of a performance and wind up distracting Lily from her work Inadvertently they wind up showing us just how seriously Lily takes her work The filmmakers do their best work by just shutting up and letting the cameras record events A considerable portion of the film shows Lily onstage during the work in progress shows and during the actual Broadway opening night This shows us Lily at her best Like a dancer she makes her work look effortless However the film shows us that her work is a long labor especially when the film shows us the development of the character of Agnus Angst Prior to this work Lily and Jane had only ever used this character once Through the developmental shows and Lily s sessions with a drama coach we see this character evolve from ideas and words into a genuine living personality In this film we see Jane Wagner finally get the credit she deserves It is very obvious that Jane does the bulk of the writing of Lily s material and that control of the script lies in Jane s hands The magic of these two women as a team definitely shines through in this film They are a perfectly matched set and they have the ideal creative situation the writer who writes for her intended performer and the performer who performs up to the expectations of her script The filmmakers were smart enough to show what their intended audience came to see Lily Tomlin in action There are several TV clips including Lily s first TV appearance and there are many wonderful segments from Signs Of Intelligent Life However the film s title should have reflected that the film is chiefly a making of the show film To name the film after Lily discredits the efforts of Jane Wagner and Cheryl Swannack company manager a very visible woman in the film and everyone else involved in creating Signs Of Intelligent Life To name the film after Lily Tomlin is to suggest that the film is going to examine either the star herself or the generalized concept of a show biz star What the film actually examines is a process not just the one person Don t expect to see this one nominated for Best Documentary next year It is however the most entertaining documentary I have seen in a long time On the 4 to 4 scale 2 I worry whoever thought up the term quality control thought if we didn t control it it would get out of hand from The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In the Universe
0030,Breaker Morant,1980,Speaking of unknown great movies here is a short list of unknown forgotten films that populate my all time favorite list Face in the Crowd 1957 The writer director team of the earlier Marlon Brando classic On The Waterfront collaborated on this melodrama of a bum from the South who gets on the radio and becomes what is now known as a media celebrity in the early days of television Andy Griffith of all people turns in one of the most galvanizing performances you ll ever see Turn off the lights watch it all at once and be stunned The Tenant 1976 Roman Polanski s existential horror film about a man with a shaky lease on his own soul Polish immigrant in Paris Polanski takes the apartment of a woman who hasn t quite committed suicide The clearest example I know of Polanski s greatness as a filmmaker this film can be seen as three or four independent great films as straightforward mystical horror as creepy blackest comedy as a depiction of existential detachment along the lines of Polanski s earlier Repulsion as a brutal examination of human vampirism Again you have to pay full attention to get the full impact but under the right conditions this one will have you raving for days McCabe and Mrs Miller 1971 Robert Altman s first film after the celebrity afforded him by M A S H wasn t entirely ignored but neither does it have nearly the regard it deserves Possibly the first revisionist Western it s an exquisite mood piece exactly like a Leonard Cohen song and a number of those appear on the soundtrack Warren Beatty plays a gunfighter attempting to retire to a dingy mining town running a whorehouse Or rather getting Julie Christie to run it for him This is a classic for illustrating the magic of cinema as all the scenes and small bits add up to a deeply moving melancholy finale Breaker Morant 1981 again hardly an unknown it enjoyed a sweep of the Australian Academy Awards this is a courtroom drama and a moral examination of stunning perfection Breaker Morant is an Australian officer in the Boer wars in South Africa brought up on war crimes charges by British officials in search of a scapegoat It is first a riveting courtroom drama as the attorneys for Morant struggle to overcome the system But it is also about moral ambiguity personal responsibility and colonial exploitation of the Australians as well as the South Africans by the British recalling implicitly such historic tragedies as the Holocaust and the war in Vietnam But the show s the thing it isn t every day that you have to tear your eyes away from a film and forcibly remind yourself that what you re seeing is really just a movie Sullivan s Travels 1943 Miracle of Morgan s Creek 1941 the seven or eight movies made by Preston Sturges between 1939 and 1944 other highlights are Hail the Conquering Hero Palm Beach Story the original Unfaithfully Yours and The Lady Eve are as unrecognized a set of national movie treasures as I could name No one before or since has combined snappy wordplay low slapstick loony characterizations hurtling plots arch social commentary especially regarding the then sacred small town America and sure handed direction in such tight packages Miracle at Morgan s Creek is both the wildest of his comedies and the most cutting the plot concerns a small town girl who marries and gets pregnant by one of the five soldiers Oh I don t know it was something like Ratskiwatsky she goes out with one night before they ship out to Europe Sullivan s Travels is Sturges masterpiece at once a self defense for doing comedy in a grim world a satire of socially conscious filmmaking and a moving picture of the suffering comedy relieves If that sounds like an odd mix then you get an idea of the miracle that Sturges pulls off here The ease and sure footedness with which he switches from broad comedy to tragedy again and again will make you gasp
0031,Stunt Man The,1980,I have been enjoying reading about the various movies that people have been posting to this discussion of great unknown movies It must be obvious by now that one man s great unknown is another mans sure everyone knows that Be that as it may here are my favorite great unknown movies There are many others I could write about but I will control myself somewhat So what other movies have I been missing
0032,Brother Sun Sister Moon,1973,There has been a good deal of discussion about unsung films many of which among the film fans I know are at least somewhat sung I want to recommend a film that I have never heard anyone else recommend What makes it even odder is that it is a religious film and I generally hate religious films This one didn t play fair however I already loved the film before I recognized the story or the allusion of the title The film is Franco Zefferelli s 1973 BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen Just about any frame of the film blown up could make a beautiful poster for the film Music is by popular singer Donovan and the script bears four names usually a bad sign including Zefferelli and of all people Lina Wertmuller Some people claim IT S A WONDERFUL LIFE always has the power to cheer them up Capra s film doesn t do that for me but this film does
0033,Long Riders The,1980,Another western and I don t generally like westerns Like GREASER S PALACE though I don t really consider this one to be so much of a western The focus of this film is the characters not their guns This is the western with the best gimmick of the decade the James brothers are played by James and Stacy Keach the Younger brothers are played by David Keith and Robert Carradine the Miller brothers are played by Dennis and Randy Quaid and Bob and Charlie Ford are played by Nicholas and Christopher Guest four sets of brothers played by four sets of brothers But unlike most gimmicks this gimmick doesn t detract from your enjoyment of the movie The story is primarily that of the James Younger gang This version seems to be based more on fact than on speculation though On this level the movie succeeds very well Underneath the historical facts we get a glimpse of the bandits as people this is where the speculation comes in To this end the film resembles BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID except that the characters aren t so loveable The major resemblance between the two films is that the bandits are tripped up by time and progress both of which have quietly passed them by There is a wonderful scene although brief in THE LONG RIDERS where the James and Younger brothers plus Clell Miller and two hired men are riding into a town to rob the bank As they ride their horses down the street a strange noise grows louder and louder A steam engined vehicle a steamroller I think comes rumbling up the street The bandits stop dead in their tracks as this strange machine forces its way past them Shortly after this their attempt at robbing a bank is foiled by a new time lock on a safe THE LONG RIDERS features good acting a nice script and great music by Ry Cooder
0034,Greasers Palace,1972,So you say that you thought HAIL MARY was controversial This one makes HAIL MARY look like HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS Imagine if you will this scene It is the old west In a small town built around a saloon called Greaser s Palace all the locals are gathered for the show A young woman sings about lost innocence and a beautiful young woman s lust Everyone is quite pleased with the song A figure shrouded in white enters unnoticed He walks up to one particularly slimy looking character and puts a cigar out on his chest The slimy looking man screams in agony and disrupts the show He is carried out of the bar and Seaweedhead Greaser owner of the saloon and the town follows close behind He s had enough out of this character so he tells him to head for the border The slimy looking man pleads But Paw Greaser repeats his warning and his slimy looking son starts to run Greaser calls to him smiles and beckons for him to return Lamy Homo for that is his son s name turns around and heads back Greaser pulls out two pistols and shoots him This is the opening scene of GREASER S PALACE This has to be one of the most truly bizarre movies that I have seen in many a moon A savior Allan Arbus parachutes down into a nearby field He is a vaudeville entertainer in a zoot suit Every time Greaser kills his son the savior brings him back to life He performs miracles like dancing on water and bringing Lamy Homo Greaser back to life and he performs song and dance numbers at the saloon He s got the boogie in his fingers and the hubba hubba in his soul Seaweedhead Greaser Albert Henderson is the corrupt owner of Greaser s Palace He locks his mother in a cage with a mariachi band He suffers from such a severe case of constipation that the entire town gathers around whenever he goes to the outhouse He surrounds himself with seedy characters who explain to him graphically I might add their sexual exploits GREASER S PALACE is one of the strangest yet most engrossing films I have seen Although I found it hard to believe the events as they unfolded I also found it impossible to look away from my TV I now own it on videotape I m not even going to try to rate this one on any scale For the record I found HAIL MARY to be one of the most boring films of the decade GREASER S PALACE beats it by a country mile as a potentially controversial version of the gospel
0035,Shermans March,1986,SHERMAN S MARCH is an interesting somewhat offbeat movie by an indie filmmaker A brief summary follows Scene New York Young struggling filmmaker from the South gets a grant to make a documentary about General Sherman s devastating march through the South Before he can start however his girlfriend dumps him and throws his life into chaos He figures a trip through the South is just what he needs and so off he goes with camera on shoulder throughout the entire trip Scene The South His family somewhat distressed by his still single status immediately introduces him to every eligible and somewhat wacky girl they can think of The movie eventually becomes a three hour cinema verite excursion into life love survivalists Southern Americana and even occasionally General Sherman s march It s fun and funny the limited narrative is very understatedly and dead pan funny but it is a bit long and does drag toward the end Overall I would recommend it especially if you have any experience or interest in making films home videos etc I guess that s about it hope you can find it I don t think it was shot being intended for general release
0036,Raising Arizona,1987,CAPSULE Terrific fun probably destined to become a cult classic This is the most fun I ve had at a movie since BRAZIL Before BRAZIL it was SILVER STREAK That should tell you something about my orientation so if you hated BRAZIL you can probably stop reading now and assume you re going to loathe RAISING ARIZONA too Comedy movies usually leave me cold AIRPLANE wasn t funny except when Beaver s mom translated Jive GHOSTBUSTERS was stupid and what can be said of REVENGE OF THE NERDS Ugh THE HOLY GRAIL was a wasted afternoon and after seeing all his movies except THREE AMIGOS I ve decided that Steve Martin can t do a decent movie Yes including DEAD MEN DON T WEAR PLAID SILENT MOVIE had its moments but they were pretty far apart I ve never seen BLAZING SADDLES although I understand that there are two funny parts one where a guy slugs a horse and one where they fart I ve never found farting to be particularly funny see So in RAISING ARIZONA there is no farting What there is is incredible some of the silliest anti heroes you would ever hope not to meet much less see your sister date in an imbroglio complete with a high speed chase scene and a detour to pick up a lost package of Huggies the fragging of a surrealistic bad ass biker total morons tunneling out of prison via the main sewer system and tons of great baby s eye views of adults To me that s part of the charm of this minor classic It has an innocence that s believable a fresh outlook that left me at least wishing it were twice as long Once the action starts it never lets go kind of an Indiana Jones turned inside out Yes but is it ART Well I think so There are some very intelligent comments scattered throughout accounting in part for my going back for a second look For me this movie represents an accomplishment centered on an internal consistency and logic all its own while taking the stance that nothing is sacred These two qualities are the life blood of good comedy for me Did anyone on the net ever see Madison Wisconsin s Kentucky Fried Theater do their live rendition of MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR That had those qualities as my other favorites mentioned above do In one scene the hero H I has decided that for the good of his wife he must leave her His letter contains archaic words and phrases like tarry and yon giving the scene a bathos that is very difficult to describe we KNOW H I doesn t talk like that so we assume he doesn t have that sort of vocabulary Or does he In another beauty a Business Man and his Wife share a scene that looks just like a theater set The perspective is foreshortened and the furniture placement and even their gestures and speeches seem like something Noel Coward or perhaps Pinter would have dreamed up while wasted on pig tranqs Timing pacing camera work everything is so well done that I got really caught up in the characters who are a perfect match to the crazy but still believable world the movie creates If your tastes in humor are a bit offbeat if you don t mind satire aimed at bewilderingly stupid criminal types and if you basically like to laugh yourself to tears you re in for a treat with this one On the Mark Leeper Network Standard Scale I give it a 3 7 It would be a 4 except I thought the ending scene was just a bit too drawn out But I guess the denouement was worth waiting for so Hey Go see it You ll like it
0037,Swimming to Cambodia,1987,SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA is an hour and a half of a man talking Spalding Gray spent several weeks in Thailand acting a small part in the film THE KILLING FIELDS and this film a record of his performance before a live audience in a perfomance gallery in New York is a monologue about events and observations surrounding the filming including the decimation of Cambodia the nature of Hollywood reality the fleshly pleasures of Bangkok the Gulf of Siam drugs American foreign policy relationships and himself Spalding Gray You can imagine this is a film with scope It was directed by Jonathon Demme who after the Talking Heads concert film STOP MAKING SENSE and the Yuppie comedy SOMETHING WILD is rapidly becoming a hero among modern directors His presence in the film is firm but subdued providing emphasis and enhancing mood with sound effects camera angles cross cutting editing and Laurie Anderson s understated music The star of course is Gray and he makes the time go by lickety split He is of that rare breed of storytellers who command the totality of your attention and imagination while speaking and he leaves you with something when you go out This film is valuable for several reasons First as a completely successful exercise in minimalism you re never less than interested in what he s saying and often deeply moved Second as a political lesson bringing home the real horror of the rule of Pol Pot who now lurks behind the border of Thailand waiting to take over again with the support of the United States Third as grist for the intellectual mill Gray is really talking about movie reality vs flesh and blood reality and how they get all mushed up Fourth he is an inspiration Seeing the world through his eyes is a challenge to observe and absorb in the same probing synthetic way Finally this film is a document of an archetype Gray is pounded by what he experiences but he never loses his very 80s irony and detachment towards it
0038,Creepshow 2,1987,Even though I was born in 1967 I am a big fan of EC Comics style horror tales of the early 60 s CREEPSHOW and CREEPSHOW II directed and screenplay by George Romero based on stories by Stephen King certainly pay homage to these comics fondly perpetuating the style and its numerous conventions Even though CREEPSHOW II boasts one of the premiere directors and producers of the modern horror movie George Romero the movie comes off with no tension little shock value and very little that is frightening or entertaining Even though CREEPSHOW II has the most popular horror writer today to thank for its source material the three Stephen King stories contained in CREEPSHOW II are too simple too mundane and too uninteresting in this medium for the film to be a success Even though CREEPSHOW II has high intentions of being as outrageous as its predecessor it ends up an uninspired failure I enjoyed CREEPSHOW a good deal It was a wild departure from the more mundane slasher film that was so popular at the time with an animated framing sequence and a light hearted macabre approach And best of all the five vignettes were graphic tense and above all interesting CREEPSHOW was an absorbing engrossing package CREEPSHOW II retains the animation and light hearted black humor but it has neglected the most important part the three vignettes are neither tense or intriguing The first vignette Old Chief Woodenhead is the longest of the three or maybe it just seems the longest and also the worst George Kennedy stars as an aging shopkeeper in a decaying Arizona desert town entrusted with a great prize The title character is a cigar store Indian mounted outside George s hardware and grocery store From the opening moments of the story you know the wooden Indian is going to come to life just as much as you knew Seth Brundle was going to turn into a human fly This story is overly simple it is merely a revenge fantasy And most objectionable when the revenge does come it happens off camera This sort of restraint seems surprising coming from two artists who seem to revel in vivid and graphic story telling But the biggest problem with this segment is the pacing about 70 of the action is George Kennedy talking in a slow drawl And it s drawn out too stretched out to be about five times as long as it needs to be The second vignette is The Raft which I had already encountered in King s most recent short story collection SKELETON CREW The story involves four characters who are stranded in a lake on a raft surrounded by a water borne blob like icky thing There is some tension here but unfortunately this segment is marred by two unfortunate and very avoidable errors Firstly the special effects for the blob thing are poorly done it looks like they just got a plastic tarp and pulled it around with some string Secondly they ve given away the surprise ending in this movie s commercials We were near the end of this story and a certain scene from the commercial had yet to occur which meant that everyone in the theatre who had seen the commercial knew what was going to happen next This is an unforgivable sin I hope the person who chose this particular scene to put in the commercial is relieved unceremoniously of all duties The third story The Hitchhiker comes closest to succeeding Here the graphic special effects are more unrestrained but Romero spends too much camera time on the special effects allowing us to see how plastic and mechanical they are There is some tension here but these moments are few and far between because it is too prolonged If this segment had been five minutes shorter instead of being drawn out into a series of dull driving scenes with whiney voiceovers I would have liked it much more As it is the audience is quickly bored and the ending becomes much more predictable simply because we are given so much time to think about it And finally the animated framing sequence is supposed to be an amusing example of the type of retribution that was the staple of EC Comics If the animation were more competent or if the story was paced better or even if the story wasn t so lame the audience would have something to do other than shout out comments As it is the only interesting thing about the framing sequence is the blatant and seemingly intentional Freudian imagery So the two big problems with CREEPSHOW II are that the stories are predictable and uninteresting This is mainly because they are drawn out far longer than they should be about half of the movie is extraneous and distracting footage a void which should have been filled by a couple more stories just like they did in CREEPSHOW I And why is King suddenly so formulaic Here are the two formualae found in CREEPSHOW II FORMULA 1 1 Meet sympathetic characters 2 Sympathetic characters get screwed by unsympathetic villains 3 Unsympathetic characters destroyed by supernatural agents FORMULA 2 1 Meet sympathetic characters 3 Sympathetic characters destroyed by supernatural agents for no real reason other than to show gory special effects If there s to be a CREEPSHOW III I can only make one suggestion Stephen George you guys have to get more original stories and you can t pad out three 10 minute stories into 90 minutes Get five or so stories and make each one fast paced A horror movie should never be boring Unless you re being boring on purpose for some reason I can t fathom Some social statement that I completely missed Oh I can t say CREEPSHOW II is all bad True to form most of the narrator s puns are terrible
0039,Secret of My Succe$s The,1987,This is Michael J Fox s Family Ties BACK TO THE FUTURE new movie It is about a Kansas kid Fox who comes to New York to make it to the top Old plot It is fairly predictable all the way through and requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief to enjoy as Fox s character is repeatedly doing stupid outrageous things that have no apparent purpose other than to get him into funny sticky situations Nevertheless I found it highly entertaining and a pretty good parody of the business executive world I don t want to give away too much of the plot but the basic idea is that Fox gets a job in the mail room and not content to make his way up through normal channels also takes over the office of a recently canned executive making decisions and coming up with ideas for how the company should be run all of them good ones of course The movie covers office politics and office sexuality and has some pretty stereotypical characters like the company head who is married but always fools around on the side the female executive who got there by screwing the boss but of course turns out to be competent in her own right after all this IS the 1980 s and of course the boss s sexually frustrated wife who has the hots for Fox Despite the fact that the resolution of almost every scene is predictable I enjoyed this movie and found myself laughing all the way through I did find the plot a little forced and contrived so I give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale in use in this group As a comparison the person who recently posted a very positive review of RAISING ARIZONA and who referred to MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL as a wasted afternoon would probably NOT like this movie On the other hand if you enjoyed OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE you ll probably want to catch this one too
0040,Shermans March,1986,It doesn t happen very often you go to see a film that everyone and I mean EVERYONE from Siskel and Ebert on up to your closest friends has said is a wonderful movie And you sit through the film without enjoying it one whit As I said unusual that you should be the only one who fails to applaud it among all your peers seems strange But no less valid an opinion Well Siskel and Ebert told me how wonderful SHERMAN S MARCH was My friends told me it was hilarious My parents called and said that they really enjoyed it So a few weeks ago I toddled down to the Market Theater and sat through a matinee of Ross McElwee s extremely popular documentary of his quest for a Southern woman he can relate to And you know I didn t dislike it SHERMAN S MARCH is several months of McElwee s life on film he carries a camera around wherever he goes much like Albert Brooks does in his comedy about a family driven mad by a documentary team Except Brooks s film was a fictional concept a gag on the effects of a sustained documentary on its subjects McElwee actually does this and on his family and acquaintances letting his sardonic voice float over the events on film He has been given a grant to study the progress and lasting effect of General Sherman s march through the South He begins the documentary on that note but soon turns it into a visual record of his attempt to find an interesting girl during his trip and the foibles of the people he meets This could have been interesting had McElwee worked at showing sympathy with many of the people he examines but instead he seems to be either holding them up for ridicule Boy folks look at THIS one or taking us through his relation with the latest woman from his past present After fifteen minutes I had gotten the idea of how his role as a narrator extended into his relationships and caused their eventual dissolution and was ready for something new After a half hour I was hoping against hope that this film changed directions pretty quick By the hour mark I was splitting my time between looking at my watch fervently praying for the film to be a little over an hour in length and wondering how anyone else in the theater could take this nebbish self indulgent waffling for another minute By the hour and a half mark I felt like someone whose house had been invaded by a horde of boring annoying people and had been forced to sit at the head of the dinner table and listen to every one of them mutter on about him herself The entire film disappears into a morass of McElwee s pointless emotional ramblings Only when he introduces us to Charleen Swansea a woman who he had already produced a documentary does the film wake you up again And this is due only to Swansea who could run a party on her personality alone But soon SHERMAN S MARCH returns to its dreary narrator and its sluggish progress My final word on the subject by the end of this film you ll understand why Ross McElwee has had relationships with so many women None of them could stand him for more than two weeks at a time
0042,Extreme Prejudice,1987,Warning anyone offended by blatant leering machismo had better avoid this film Or lots of blood guts men against men and mano et mano stuff In other words it s a Walter Hill film With a John Milius script I always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm wrestling matches These films always contain male characters I have a very hard time identifying with probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb And we got tough guys galore here drug running banditos by the dozens all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill tempered overall a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover up supposedly any connection between the government and the drug runners and lots of shit kicking Texas dirt farmers who d as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you In particular we got Nick Nolte as one hard ass Texas Ranger Powers Boothe as the drug kingpin Michael Ironsides as the leader of the secret army and Rip Torn as the local sheriff Torn is the sympathetic figure of the group he smiles before shooting anyone As to women well I ve never seen Jane Fonda or Meryl Streep in a Walter Hill film and at this rate I doubt I ever will Women exist here to look good comfort the man and get argued over Gosh Just like the old days Frankly this is a pretty good movie if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff The cinematography is excellent the cast of characters is broad and has texture the script is quite good and the film lets you keep up with what s happening yourself without spelling it out to you I appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up Finally there s lots of Sam Peckinpah slow motion shoot ups
0043,Abel,1986,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival ABEL Netherlands 1986 Director Writer Alex van Warmerdam Cast Alex van Warmerdam Henri Garcin Olga Zuiderhock Annet Matherbe Subtitled ABEL is that standard staple of films everywhere the family farce Here we have a penthouse apartment inhabited by Abel a 31 year old eccentric who has never left the house and likes to try to kill flies with scissors and his parents a Valkyrie like mother Dove who indulges her son s behavior and the strict parochial father Victor who attempts to have them all lead a normal life though his definition of normal is not particularly wide spread thank goodness The film opens with the growing friction between Abel and Victor and the rather bizarre actions of Dove and how it drives Victor out to find a mistress Sis As Dove and Abel become stranger and stranger Victor be comes more and more frustrated until one night he throws Abel out of the house and by coincidence this is a farce after all into the arms of Sis Mildly entertaining with a few pretty funny parts but don t go out of your way to see it A D 1 50 film
0044,Odd Birds,1985,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival ODD BIRDS USA 1986 Director Screenwriter Jeanne Collachia Cast Michael Moriarty Donna Lei Ming Lew Nancy Yee Ever have a film that upon panning it makes you feel like Snidely Whiplash Makes you feel as if you tripped Shirley Temple and were proceeding to kick her in her little ribs Well I m going to have to give thumbs down to ODD BIRDS and I don t like having to do it very much because the film has some good concepts and some nice acting ruined by awful technical work and an ending that has to be seen to be believed This is a slice of life picture about a fifteen year old girl Ming Lew who is shy and withdrawn but who desperately wishes to go into acting Her mother Yee who immigrated from China constantly informs her that her ambitions are pipe dreams and having no friends and the average amount of confidence a 15 year old has she begins to have doubts about whether she should attempt acting based on both her mother s assertions that you have to know somebody and an ever growing assumption that a girl of Chinese descent could not get a leading role which is not written specifically for someone Oriental Then at a sock hop at a Catholic boy s school that she is dragged to by her with it cousin she meets an Irish Catholic brother Moriarty whom she strikes up a friendship with and who she finds it easy to talk with He becomes her one friend and builds her confidence by listening to her fears and dreams However his leaving for a new school along with an audition with Gower Champion who is I guess somewhat of a big shot in the musical world bring her emotions to the fore The film is fine when it takes on the emotions and problems of a girl going through this particular stage in her life the dialogue between Ming Lew and Moriarty and between Ming Lew and Yee rings very true to form Lew is usually good for the role and Michael Moriarty has always been to my mind one of the hidden treasures of the American acting community he continues to grace small films like this or weird films like Q or THE STUFF like an undiscovered Lithgow Where the film falls down is in the technical direction The film is supposed to be set in San Francisco in 1966 however the way the film looks makes you wonder if it was actually done in 1966 The cinematography is so standard that it looks like it was done by someone from the Health Services Film Board The music is incredibly overblown during emotional scenes One of the girl s main talents is her singing voice but the dubbing is so inept here that it is impossible to ignore no matter how badly you wish to And the ending cripes where did they get it It is so hokey and done without so little care that it resembles the pipe dream mentioned by the mother at the beginning of the film Everyone grins like idiots while the girl gets a special chance to sing for Champion who of course says You re fantastic Get some training and then come see me O kay This could have been done adequately but everyone is so over enthusiastic that you wonder if they were shipped in from an old MGM musical
0045,Hollywood Shuffle,1987,Capsule review TV situation comedy punctuated with hilarious skits Robert Townsend produced directed and starred in this comedy about the lack of roles for black actors in Hollywood The story could have been better but the humor of the skits was right on target What should I tell you about HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE I saw it with an audience that loved it Three people I was with were darn insulting to me because I did not love it too Should I say positive things to tell you what was good about it or say negative things to tell you why it wasn t great Some of both I suspect Bobby Taylor played by Robert Townsend who also produced and directed is a talented black actor doing what a lot of talented black actors do He s working at a fast food restaurant and desperately trying to find an acting job There are few actings jobs for blacks at all and they are all as street pimps muggers servants or slaves Not that Bobby wouldn t love to get one of these roles but deep down he wants to play great dramatic roles like starring in ripoffs of RAMBO and INDIANA JONES As Bobby goes through the frustrating life of an aspiring black actor he imagines skits relevant to his situation The film is structured perhaps not so much as a story but as a set of skits with a connecting story The skits while not always entirely original are funny They are very funny One is as ad for the Black Actors School that is great And another a take off of review programs is magnificent The problems with the film are all with the connecting story I am not saying it is actively bad It just is not particularly good yes it makes a serious point that there are few good Hollywood roles for black actors and further it suggests that black actors should refuse to take the stereotyped roles that have traditionally been given to blacks But the story is just not done on a very high level There is too little time left after the skits to do a story of any more depth than an episode of THE JEFFERSONS What s left is manipulative and sentimental Talk about stereotypes there is Bobby s sweet but cantankerous grandmother and his adorable little brother Without the skits the story might be good enough to play on TV on ABC maybe With the skits the film is quite worth seeing Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0046,Seven Waves Away,1957,Capsule review This is the story of an overcrowded lifeboat It is a good treatment of the hard decision between being humanitarian and risking killing everyone on the lifeboat or being crueller but more realistic This film tells more about the nature of disaster and how people react to it than all the disaster films Irwin Allen ever made In my review of the film ALIENS I said that one of the reasons it was not as good as ALIEN was that it introduced a weak and sympathetic character There is an unwritten romantic code in horror and disaster films that says that most women and children particularly the appealing ones are safe In THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE there are a lot of people who start the journey to safety and one by one the strong characters die off Carol Lynley and two children survive if I remember right I think everyone loves to see the weak survive but nobody really believes it I guess it is just a cinematic convention I just saw on cable from Atlanta the 1957 film ABANDON SHIP Oddly enough I had never heard of it until very recently and I think someone described it to me just about a week or so ago This is the story of a very overcrowded lifeboat and the captain who really has to make some hard decisions about who is going to live and who is going to die These decisions are based on logic not on what will play well to an audience The film covers topics often reserved for post holocaust films and often side stepped even there In specific there are questions of triage No medical supplies can be wasted on those who are too sick or disabled to continue There are two or three nice ironic twists at the end of the film and the revelation that this is a true story which perhaps accounts for why it seems so believable The film is the real stuff I should mention the film stars Tyrone Power and a host of faces familiar from British films and TV And let us face it I love just about any film that has two warring factions both of which seem right ABANDON SHIP British title SEVEN WAVES AWAY is just about the most thought provoking disaster film I can imagine Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0048,Mitt liv som hund,1985,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival MY LIFE AS A DOG Sweden 1985 Director Lasse Hallstrom Screenwriters Lasse Hallstrom Brasse Brannstrom Pelle Berglund Reidar Jonsson from the novel by Jonnson Cast Anton Glanzelius Anki Liden Tomas von Bromssen Melinda Kinnaman Sub titled Several years ago I saw FANNY AND ALEXANDER Ingmar Bergmen s supposedly last picture which was being hailed everywhere for its beauty and the lightness of tone it contained especially when compared with much of the directors other work While I found the film satisfying I still thought it fairly stuffy and certainly overlong Its imagery promoted a romantic air but the ethereal script left little to support it I came away feeling vaguely let down MY LIFE AS A DOG is everything I expected FANNY AND ALEXANDER to be While it contains little of the cinematographic skill of Bergmen its settings its characters and especially its script have made it one of the best life as seen through children s eyes films I ve ever seen This is up there with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and MY BODYGUARD better than the latter I think The story centers on a young boy something of an eccentric who lives in a city apartment with his older brother and his invalid mother His experiences are related as flashbacks between his staring into the stars As his mother worsens he is sent to his uncle and aunt s place in the country a town built around a glass factory and made up a variety of wonderful eccentrics It is that kind of place that Dickens or Capra could create and so many have tried to imitate here it is done successfully Gene Siskel used to give his highest ratings to films that contained places he d like to visit people that he would like to talk to MY LIFE AS A DOG has that in spades you want to see it another time for the same reason you look through a photo album I m not sure I could talk about the acting here each person seems to have disappeared into their role with such abandon that it is difficult to think of them as having a life outside their character which I guess is the point How this boy comes to grip with the course his life takes is bittersweet but never depressing joyful but never saccharine His friends his relatives all are done with a wonderful ordinary sense of joy Let me tell you that the audience was laughing throughout this film but not harshly and I noticed that they were also smiling constantly which is a sign I value even more The director who appeared afterwards received a three minute standing ovation it was I think deserved It is interesting to note that according to the director it was not planned for foreign release however he says the same reactions we displayed during the film seem to be universal in audiences of other countries The best film of the festival so far A 5 00 value I urge you very strongly to see this if it plays in your town It has an American distributor and hopefully will be making the rounds soon I really cannot see you being disappointed from all accounts no one here and this a Friday Night audience was
0049,Right Hand Man The,1987,Various films seen at the Seattle Film Festival IT S ALL TRUE THREE MEN ON A RAFT U S A 1942 1986 Director Orson Welles A recently uncovered one fourth of Orson Welle s planned docu drama of amazing stories around the world named IT S ALL TRUE this short dealt with Welle s attempts to document the actions of several Brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to Rio on a raft While several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount Welle s attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set Impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians SADIE THOMPSON U S A 1928 Director Raoul Walsh Screenwriter Raoul Walsh from the John Colton play Rain based on W Somerset Maugham s story Miss Thompson Cast Gloria Swanson Raoul Walsh Lionel Barrymore Silent After the discussion of the newly restored version of Frank Capra s LOST HORIZON where several scenes had been restored using stills I was interested to see SADIE THOMPSON where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago This is the silent version of the Somerset Maugham short story Miss Thompson This is one of the most skillful silent films I have ever seen little awkwardness and a very clever script The actors Gloria Swanson Raoul Walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially Lionel Barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save Sadie s soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel Swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy Sadie Unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film or the original script The happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on I cannot believe Maugham s short story ended with Sadie and Our Hero moving to Australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for Still it s entertaining right up to the end certainly Barrymore s incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the Falwells Bakkers and Robertses of the religious worlds This is an animated film from Czechoslovakia that is definitely NOT for kids It tells the old folk tale of the Pied Piper with a twist ending I find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it Perhaps economic content is a better word it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light Nor human nature nor anything else for that matter As you may have guessed this is not a TGIF film this is the kind of film you are glad is over Not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons this is stop animation that is very well done All the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts except for the animated stuffed rats Boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesn t it Add onto that set design that makes THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALIGARI absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night Some gore Don t bring children to this one Don t bring adults to this one unless they re fascinated by puppetry and or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped Blech This film takes us back and forth over the East German West German border with Meier an East German wallpaperer whose father in the West dies and leaves him a good deal of money His uncle also in the West sneaks Meier out of the country unknown to the East Germans Meier however is less than thrilled his girlfriend his friends and his job which he likes all exist in East Germany After a round the world trip his boss think s he s on leave in Bulgaria Meier starts visiting East Germany on day visas with a fake ID and uses his money and his connections to the West to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work while everyone think s he s still living in East Germany Of course something goes wrong and the ending is very funny but it takes the film too long to get there The humor is spread too thin and much of the plot is too obvious as is the acting Still a good concept for the comedy and the last five minutes are pretty funny After a lifetime of movie going and about four years of attending the Seattle International Film Festival I ve learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to 1 Be wary of French Comedies These people like Jerry Lewis 2 Ken Russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait 3 Any film where SIFF Associate Director Gary Tucker refers to the lead as old pouty lips is probably not worth watching 4 When an Australian film only awards credit is Best Cinematography watch out Australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since Weir and Miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossible witness MALCOLM last year task Well I ignored rules 3 4 last night and sat through a film that should be in the Golden Turkey Awards It s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 s about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses Lots and lots of horses The film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of Her Ladyship which I guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the Missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir Unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident Highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor s daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a window between them while it s raining you d think a woman studying medicine would know better The photography IS good but I kept wishing for B W everything seems sepia colored anyway Actually I wished I was watching SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA instead but that s life Grade Z Avoid like the plague unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks
0050,Amazing Grace and Chuck,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK USA 1987 Director Mike Newell Writer Producer David Field Cast Joshua Zuehlke Alex English William L Peterson Dennis Lipcomb Jamie Lee Curtis Gregory Peck Every year every year at the festival I wait for that film to come along that one that just pulls me out of my seat sticks its face up next to my nose and roars SUR PRISE into my bewildered visage It s almost always a surprise It sure as Niflheim was this time AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK is being advertised as a modern fairy tale of a boy in Montana who quits his Little League team for a very unusual reason And in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale where we roll our eyes occasionally smirk to ourselves and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a boy I wish that could happen sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty Pepsi cup into the trash Another E T Another SHORT CIRCUIT This film floored me for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough and presents itself well enough to make it more of an American folk tale with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time America has always had its mythical heros its Paul Bunyans and John Waynes this film presents us with more general but still universal ideals the honest innocent children who have their own inner wisdom the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage honor and love for their respective sport the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding but has the grit to get things done when they need doin does the latter sound familiar AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK is a showcase for these characters but it never leaves you with the feeling that it s artificial that it stands behind glass or that any sharp breeze or more importantly sharp thought will shatter the wax facade of the panorama This is a very sturdy scenario The principals are always given dialogue and always give performances ALWAYS it just blows me away which made them seem real yet enforces their particular mythic role The writer producer David Field seems to literally take all the yeah but in REAL life this would have happen thoughts you get in your head sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading in a stronger way then before Astounding He uses obstacles to the plot to enforce it I am truly impressed indeed envious with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay it s so very unusual especially in a Hollywood film I don t want to give too much away but the basic premise is that Chuck Joshua Zuehlke the Little League pitcher decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons His decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete a Boston basketball player Alex English Amazing Grace Smith and well I m leaving it at that because I wouldn t spoil this film for you for the world Let me just say this though I am not recommending this film because I think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply I don t give a rat s ass for the political point of view this film expresses one way or another I m recommending you go see this film because and only because it s an excellent story told with excellence No I don t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life while I tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted I believe in careful negotiations mutual verification etc Screw what I think The point is this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of American Dream I have ever seen on the movie screen This is THE NATURAL and more all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion and a MUCH better script to boot It carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood and more importantly without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self consciousness Special kudos to both Zuehlke a real life Little League pitcher who was picked for the part and English a forward for the Denver Nuggets for their seamless personification of their characters Jamie Lee Curtis who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as Amazing s manager and friend William L Peterson in a big change from his role in TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it and Gregory Peck as the guy we wish Ronald Reagan REALLY was and who some numbskulls still probably think he is acid political opinion Mike Newell who David Field who appeared after the film was over said was hired for his down to earth realism keeps the film from ever flapping its wings and heading into the stratosphere of pure fantasy And for Fields himself I am really truly impressed with the conception and the execution of his story He has been working five years to get this film released and I hope he makes money on AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK hand over fist because this has obviously been an project of infinite care a narrative tightrope which gives the illusion of looking simple
0052,Beverly Hills Cop II,1987,No one told Eddie Murphy and Robert D Wachs that originality counts when they were writing BEVERLY HILLS COP II Only the names of the villains and the crime have been changed to make this sequel The first 10 minutes of BEVERLY HILLS COP II convinced me I was in for a long 2 hours 20 minutes into this movie I asked the guy next to me to wake me if anything funny happened The first reel reintroduces us to Axel Foley and the rest of the cast from BEVERLY HILLS COP Foley is still causing trouble in Detroit In Beverly Hills Rosewood Taggart and Bogomil are in trouble with the new police chief We are also treated to some mood setting scenes Murphy s You ll believe anything if I talk fast and loud routine some fast cars being driven recklessly but not always wrecklessly and a quick robbery to show us how much firepower the bad guys will be toting The stage is set for Foley to go West and stop the bad guys while fighting off hostile local cops and hiding from his own captain in Detroit In the first thirty minutes Murphy hogs the camera to the exclusion of everything but his car Every situation every joke and every shot is straight out of the first movie COP II shows all the signs of being a hacked together recycling of COP I Then something wonderful happens About 30 minutes into COP II everything clicks and the film starts to build the same momentum that carried COP I The camera moves off Murphy and starts pulling in the supporting cast John Ashton as Sergeant Taggart and Judge Reinhold s Detective Billy Rosewood save COP II from being a mediocre rehash of COP I Reinhold is a pleasure to watch as he adds some much needed pacing and direction to Murphy s frantic Axel Foley Reinhold gets more than his share of the laughs by parodying tough guy movies and hamming up his sensitive character Ashton doesn t have a lot to do as the conservative and worried Sergeant Taggart but he works well as Reinhold s straight man Since Murphy is no longer expected to carry the movie on his own his performance loses the hurried and pushed feel that marred the first third and COP II takes off There are still some problems Foley Taggart and Rosewood mostly stumble onto clues rather than doing any convincing detective work Foley seems to have watched too many episodes of MACGYVER having taken to checking for finger prints with Super Glue and rigging alarm systems with chewing gum There is the expected number of car chases but the profanity is way down Maybe comedians have realized that yelling certain words at the top of their lungs is no longer an automatic laugh
0053,Lepke,1975,Capsule review Minor gangster film about one of the most vicious crime lords and the only major American crime lord ever to get the death penalty Fidelity to the truth is generally high with occasion serious lapses Similar material has been done better I do not watch gangster movies the way I watch other films A gangster film requires homework and particularly if I am going to watch it on video I will stop it and watch parts over The reason is that I have a couple of good sources on American crime Robert Jay Nash s BLOODLETTERS AND BADMEN gives detailed biographies of American criminals Nearly as good and presenting a lot of non overlapping detail is Carl Sifakis s ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN CRIME I listen to historical details in the film carefully and if on video sometimes two or three times Before the film I will have read the primary entries about the characters in the film During the film I will stop and read about the more tangential characters I fume about historical inaccuracies for literary license as if they were facts everyone knows and has always known even if I have just read about them for the first time ten minutes earlier Cinemax this month had LEPKE the 1975 biography of Louis Lepke Buchalter produced and directed by Menachem Golan who would go on to form Cannon Pictures with Yoram Globus this film s executive producer The film was made shortly after THE GODFATHER II undoubtedly to ride that film s wave of popularity Israelis Golan and Globus apparently not wanting Italian mobsters to get all the attention made their film about one of the most powerful American criminals who just happened to be Jewish Lepke was one of the two or three founding fathers of the American syndicate and of Murder Incorporated Generally the film follows Lepke s career fairly faithfully though a number of important details are omitted near the end The worst of them was having Lepke murder Legs Diamond within days after Diamond saw Lepke kill Little Auggie Orgen In the film apparently Lepke wanted to silence Diamond so has him stabbed with an icepick while swimming at Coney Island That one I knew was all wrong without looking at the book Nobody knows who killed Diamond but it was four years after the Orgen killing and on the second floor of a private in Albany Lepke s friend Gurrah Shapiro who dies in the film defending Lepke actually outlived Lepke by three years There are probably a dozen other places where the film contradicts my sources but those two are the worst Lepke is played by Bernie Schwartz alias Tony Curtis The acting is sufficient but not outstanding Milton Berle takes a rare dramatic role as Lepke s father in law who first welcomes his son in law and later comes to hate him You re a hoa A filthy hoa he tells his daughter Some of the accurate historical detail is worth knowing like the underhanded dealings that newscaster Walter Winchell took part in to get stories The same Walter Winchell whose voice may be familiar from narrating THE UNTOUCHABLES TV show really did get involved in the stories of major mobsters In particular he took part in the capture and betrayal of Lepke by J Edgar Hoover The film was cut from 100 to 98 minutes for cable release so some of the film just turns into incoherent violence but some nice touches remain the best of which is a friendly jolly looking fellow with a moustache When you see him it is generally because in a moment or two he is going to jovially kill someone If LEPKE was to be a Jewish version of THE GODFATHER it fell somewhat short Sergio Leone s ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA comes as close to being a Jewish GODFATHER as any film and this film is not as good Give LEPKE a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0054,Koyaanisqatsi,1983,This is a Francis Ford Coppola presentation produced and directed by Godfrey Reggio music by Philip Glass cinematography by Ron Fricke This film is a visually dazzling audio inspiring vaguely anti war statement It is pretty transparent and I knew we were in trouble about 10 minutes into this film when it switched from beautiful nature landscapes to big ugly man made machines So the director chose to portray man in an essentially negative light No one is happy in this film Lots of H bombs blow up in between the pretty pictures of time lapse photography At the very end when the credits are finished we find out it is An Ire Production Tsk tsk There s little quite so irritating as video morality and video political left wing leanings Also it falls into the Lucas trap of edits that are so fast one hardly has a chance to choose to accept or reject the images being flooded into the audience s mind In this respect it is a film meant for non thinkers
0055,Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,1970,I recently had the um opportunity to see BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley Among the odiferous genre known as Badfilm this one stands out as a pungent weed a film that is skillfully bad Imagine all the worst of the late Sixties the film was made in the early Seventies strained through a Hollywood point of view and sliced like a microtome sample right through the silliest parts Roger Ebert s screenplay is a brilliant hodge podge of paisley psycho babble and psychedelic cliche I m convinced that he knew exactly what he was doing with the improbable and wandering story of an all girl rock group called The Carrie Nations with approximately six talents between them if you get my drift and I think you do I have serious doubts whether the director Russ Meyer knew what was going on and it s clear that the actors hadn t a clue Meyer known for his soft core photography of callimastian women of truly heroic proportions had impressed the studio with his Vixens film which grossed tens of millions for a 600 000 outlay When he got his big budget to make BVD which has absolutely nothing to do with the VALLEY OF THE DOLLS film book by Jacqueline Suzanne he ran right out and hired a schlock director of photography and a kid from Chicago to write it At least Ebert saw his chance I have a clear mental picture of him at his typewriter Tap tap tap and then roll on the floor with laughter I m sure he wondered if anybody would deliver the lines with straight faces As it turned out very little genuine emotion of any kind appears on any faces during the film I still marvel at how several conversations were carried on without saying one sentence in intelligible English This is my scene and it freaks me out Also telling is the searing accusation by an establishment lawyer She has been living with three other people One of them is a man and he turns points a finger for dramatic effect and emphasizes the other two are women I could go on and on The movie goes on and on And on And on Like a bad symphony it keeps ending I counted four complete distinct endings One is an Eddie Wood like voice over recounting the sins and lessons to be learned of each character in the film By this point I realized that the film was not merely an exercise in excess and bad taste but a shaggy dog See it if you think you can stand it It s a real education in how outrageous boredom can be
0056,La Bamba,1987,Starring Esai Morales Rosana DeSoto Elizabeth Pena Joe Pantoliano Lou Diamond Phillips Music by Carlos Santana and Miles Goodman Director of Photography Adam Greenberg Executive Music Producer Joel Sill Executive Producer Stuart Benjamin Produced by Taylor Hackford and Bill Borden Written and Directed by Luis Valdez Luis Valdez ZOOT SUIT has crafted a lively earthy fond remembrance of Richard Valenzuela who became famous as Ritchie Valens it could have been Richie Zuela Starting with the return of his wayward older step brother the Valenzuelas move into the Los Angeles area and Richard finds an audience for his singing and playing moving briefly on to fame and fortune Does anyone besides me not know what happened to Ritchie Valens This is a picture that works on a number of levels First the story is apparently an accurate portrayal of the life of Ritchie Valens Second the story is engrossing as cinema a moving motivated tale of the trials and tribulations of people who must face life with courage and dignity Finally this is a stirring celebration of the success of the music of the Fifties and of the cultural influences that shaped at least part of it I must credit the actors with an exceptional job I am not familiar with any of the actors and actresses which made it easy to avoid feeling that I was watching a familiar actor play yet another part but I never got the feeling that I was watching some less than talented performer stone face through a portrayal on the strength of a physical match Without exception the characters were believable and sympathetic In the only character portrayal I can attribute Lou Diamond Phillips captures Ritchie Valens as a talented committed young man with senses of both humor and duty Also worth mentioning are the performances of Valens older step brother girl friend mother and agent In particular Ritchie s older brother alternates between bouts of good natured hedonism and frustrated anger without slipping into bathos or pathos As might be expected the music is exceptional I was only aware of Ritchie Valens as a predecessor and influence on the band Los Lobos aside from being familiar with his greatest hit La Bamba but was pleasantly surprised to find that I greatly enjoyed all his songs While I am very fond of Los Lobos I wasn t aware that they had performed all of his songs until the movie was over they also appear as the mariachi band that Ritchie hears play the title song on his adventurous trip to Tijuana The film also consists of a succession of some of the classic songs of the fifties Carlos Santana also had a hand in the music according to the credits To sum up great music good acting and an interesting story make LA BAMBA not only a good movie but a good time I d give it a 2 on the Leeper 4 to 4 scale
0057,Personal Foul,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival PERSONAL FOUL USA 1987 Director Writer Ted Lichtenhaeld Cast David Morse Adam Arkin Susan Wheeler Duff F William Parker This is a film that I was inclined to like at the outset the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama ST ELSEWHERE for several years and I had understood that the director screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also I am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations nor were they satisfactory If I had to list a reason why but that would be getting ahead of myself besides it s not immediately clear as there are so many problems with the film Adam Arkin plays a grade school teacher who is sardonic cynical and somewhat abrasive but a good teacher He spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court One day he meets a drifter David Morse who plays Jack Morrison on ST ELSEWHERE in the park and inveigles him in a game of one on one basketball Morse turns out to be good and a friendship slowly develops between the two as their respective professions progress on the screen Arkin s teaching and Morse s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists So far my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack Good music to be sure but it doesn t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story it makes the film somewhat minimalistic a technique I rarely admire Suddenly their friendship is interrupted by Morse s introduction to a fellow teacher of Arkin s a woman Arkin has long admired from afar but it too reticent to approach It appears that she begins to admire Morse who enjoys here attentions but isn t sure what to do about it she doesn t realize that he is a drifter and knows nothing about his past and this causes friction between Arkin and almost everyone else Until then I had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film The conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full fledged failure The woman at least to me appeared to be fairly shallow I didn t realize how shallow until her final scene with Arkin where she reveals that she has been trying to make Arkin jealous by her attentions to Morse Somehow this is made to appear as if it is Arkin s fault and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he s gotten such a find of girlfriend Frankly dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action Arkin could make punching her in the mouth not the least After this the childish confrontation between Morse and Arkin at the end seems almost natural If I had to summarize a major gripe it s that this is a story spread too thin that creates semi likable characters at the outset and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 year olds at the last moment It might be true to life with some people but that doesn t mean I have to like it I don t Grade F Avoid
0058,High Season,1987,Various films seen at the Seattle Film Festival SOUTH BANK SHOW MICHAEL POWELL Great Britain 1986 Director David Hinton A pair of interesting filmmaker documentaries came along this week one about Michael Powell half of The Archers the famous team of Powell Pressberger who dominated the British film industry during the 1940s and early 1950s and influenced so many other British filmmakers Actually this is more of an autobiography Powell was influential in much of the documentary s appearance which is sometimes as strange as many of Powell s films Powell in the film refers to documentaries as films made by unemployed philosophers he apparently didn t want his own autobiography of which this is only the first part to be too staid so he often appears in his own film clips ducking bullets and fading to B W as he goes along The program is in video it was originally a BBC production the first part of two parts the second sadly was never made due to Powell s recent death and is a bit strange but it is certainly entertaining and worth a look if you re a fan of such wonderful productions as THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COL BLIMP BLACK NARCISSUS and THE RED SHOES or if you think that artists people who truly adhere to artistic values don t exist in the cinema Powell is was a man who lived for his ideals The documentary on William Wyler is a bit more pedestrian but then Wyler himself was an amazingly down to earth person The documentary which interviewed him several days before his death showed a man who reminded me more of my Grandpa Harry than a major film director Indeed that seems to be much of the message of the film various major film luminaries especially John Huston and Lillian Hellmen comment on how they often wondered where Willie got his extraordinary feel for how a film would work He often did not seem to know why a shot would work but he would know WHEN it would work And shot after shot of famous Wyler films THE LETTER THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES BEN HUR FUNNY GIRL and a host of others are definite proof that he knew exactly what he was doing While it does get a little campy and glitzy during its length the time spent watching it is worth it for the clips alone Great stuff HIGH SEASON Great Britain 1987 Director Clare Peploe Writers Clare Peploe Mark Peploe Cast Jacqueline Bisset James Fox Irene Papas Sebastian Shaw Robert Stephens Paris Tselios Not a good film but certainly not a tangibly bad film HIGH SEASON gets a fair all around fair plot fair dialogue fair acting and very fair weather it s shot in the Greek Isles and they are the real stars of the film Jaquelline Bisset and James Fox play an estranged couple they argue about art who live in a small village on the Greek islands their daughter spends time with one or the other Bisset is having a difficult time supporting herself and her daughter and her daughter s school fees she plans to sell her small house in the village An old friend an elderly art expert arranges the sale of a Greek vase of hers to provide some monetary support In the meantime we have a spy subplot and a few romantic situations so that the middle of the film resembles some sort of Aegean Midsummer s Night Dream The spy theme gets suddenly serious which doesn t help things one bit As someone sitting next to me said It s dross but it s sunny Mediterranean dross and it s raining outside the theater COMIC MAGAZINE Japan 1987 Director Yojira Takita Screenwriters Yuya Uchida Isao Takagi Cast Yuya Uchida Yumi Asou Beat Takeshi Hiromi Go In America we have a certain ideal of overboard press the tabloids NATIONAL ENQUIRER PEOPLE okay I think PEOPLE is no different than NATIONAL ENQUIRER Apparently the journalists in Japan make these publications look like the LADIES HOME JOURNAL in comparison This movie tells the story of a TV journalist raised on Woodward and Bernstein and wanting nothing more than to do investigative reporting who is working as the equivalent of a TV gossip columnist He is extremely dedicated and this makes him popular but it also leads him to do truly awful and ridiculous things following celebrities around invading privacy being incredibly insensitive to the pain of others As the film progresses he becomes wearier and wearier of the Hell he creates for others and for himself until he runs into the ultimate media event Apparently many of the events depicted in this film are based on true events that happened in Japan recently especially the culminating scene in this film This is not a film that is fun or easy to watch but it seems to be working at making a point and it does so very well Grade C if you d like to see where the medium may be heading MAX HEADROOM without the yoks MABOU MINES DEAD END KIDS A Story of Nuclear Power U S A 1986 Director Writer JoAnne Akalatis Cast Mabou Mines Theater troupe Frankly ATOMIC CAFE pretty much mined all the black humor to be had at the expense of the nuclear insanity we live in this film isn t that funny though the screenplay is skillful in the way it weaves images and symbols in and out of the film But all in all it was advertised as a black comedy and it tends to come out as some kind of apocalyptic high school science film
0060,Star Wars,1977,This year marks the tenth anniversary of George Lucas s STAR WARS I think it is fairly safe to say that for the fantasy film genre and for the film industry as a whole the decade has been very different than might have been expected when Fox was telling theaters that if they wanted to show THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT they would also have to book this science fiction film STAR WARS There is little doubt at least to my mind that STAR WARS is one of the three most influential films ever made In fact the only film that obviously was more influential was Edward Muybridge s sequence of snapshots of a running racehorse that was in essence the first motion picture But influential and good are two different things Recently when I listed films that I gave my highest rating to I included STAR WARS One comment I got from a reader was that it was a good list but should not include STAR WARS The belief that STAR WARS is actually good as a film is actually not very common I have heard it claimed that it is the weakest of the three currently released Star Wars films or that the whole series is a piece of fluff without much cinematic merit It is my contention that the original STAR WARS is on its own a good film and the best of its series Though it is not in the scope of this short article to examine an entire decade of fantasy films I would contend that no better science fiction horror or fantasy film has been made in the interim Before we can determine if STAR WARS really is a great film in the sense that CITIZEN KANE is a great film we have to determine some characteristics of film greatness What is it that makes a film great One characteristic would be originality A film should be experimental and should break new ground But many film experiments fail and leave audiences confused The new ground that a film breaks must be accepted by audiences so that a film leaves its mark To this extent being good is connected with being influential Still it is clear that an exploitation film may be the first of its kind and have imitators without being very good The ground that a film breaks must be valuable It should advance the art of filmmaking If a film does what it does well breaks new ground in the art of filmmaking making valuable contributions and those contributions are accepted by audiences and become part of the palette for future filmmakers no more is required for a film to achieve greatness If you come down to it that is really what makes CITIZEN KANE a great film But is STAR WARS great in the same sense I think that while CITIZEN KANE undeniably has some virtues that STAR WARS lacks and vice versa STAR WARS is great in the same sense STAR WARS WAS A GROUND BREAKING FILM It was the first marrying of cinema and the new video and computer technologies for creating images on film The effects people had to invent much of the technology as they went along The last jump in visual technology of the same magnitude had been with Willis O Brien s stop motion effects for KING KONG As late as the 60s the most visually imaginative films films like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS still relied most heavily on variations on and enhancements of O Brien s techniques Between JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and STAR WARS there were some impressive pieces of visual fantasy notably 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and LOGAN S RUN but they relied mostly on just extensive use of model work and other long existing technologies For STAR WARS a battery of new technologies was employed and for the first time since KING KONG special effects made a real quantum leap toward the goal of being able to create on the screen any scene that the mind s eye can create STAR WARS was obviously a ground breaking film from the first moments of the film Just showing a field of stars STAR WARS did something that no other film had ever done It panned the camera upward That does not sound like much but consider that not even 2001 had ever done it before Space scenes had always been done with a fixed camera and for a very good reason It was more economical not to create a background of stars large enough to pan through So scenes in space had always been done with a static camera just like all scenes were done in the early days of film I had never even realized that in all science fiction films I had seen the space shots were done with a static camera until the instant I saw Lucas s 90 degree pan Not a single model had shown on the screen and certainly not a single set or character and already the film was a one of a kind When we do finally meet characters the first two we meet are robots with personalities that are a cliche now but the closest I remember seeing before was the robot in LOST IN SPACE who occasionally would lose his cool and yell Warning Warning Danger Danger while gesticulating wildly We have seen characters for all of two seconds on the screen before we again see that STAR WARS was unprecedented And the impact of STAR WARS continues right through the film Scene after scene is done with an originality and sense of wonder totally unprecedented in the science fiction film The audience reaction was nothing short of astounding In Detroit where the film played there was a difficult left turn to get to the theater parking lot VARIETY reported that making that left turn had become the new summer sport in Detroit The lines that queued up to see the film were legendary because in so many different ways the film delivered more than it had to There was more bang per dollar of admission then perhaps any other film made to that point One thing the film delivered was a sparkling score by John Williams Williams used a leit motif approach but composed many themes each of which was attractive and which blended together into a very fine score that was reproduced for the first time with the process of Dolby sound It gave a live orchestral clarity to the score as well as allowing far more use of subliminal sound effects surrounding the audience Many were barely perceptible to the ear but certainly helped to make the experience seem more believable This reality was further enhanced by the detail Lucas embued the film with Small details throwaways that few filmmakers bother with were painstakingly added In one scene after the visit to the cantina we are watching the main characters in the background and the silhouettes of two spindly legs walk by in the foreground Because that is not where the viewer s attention is at the time many in the audience never even noticed the legs To throw in unnecessary details and then purposely call the viewer s attention away so the details may well go unnoticed is a mark of a good craftsman A little more noticeable though again unnecessary to the plot is the skeleton shown in the background in a desert scene Nobody in the script mentions the skeleton of some gargantuan desert creature as if it is a perfectly normal sight Similarly the speeder which could have been easily made a wheeled vehicle instead floats No mention is made of the floating vehicle again the matter of fact acceptance of this wonder is what helps to make the film work More noticeable but equally unrequired to the plot are some breathtaking planetscapes again of a scale that never had been used in science fiction films to that point Films like THIS ISLAND EARTH or FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS had shown planetary landscapes but they used unconvincing models or matte paintings ILM has since become known for very impressive backgrounds and spacescapes STAR WARS was their debut A few more touches perhaps not as original but which were unexpected should be mentioned One is the use of two distinguished actors in major roles Getting Sir Alec Guinness to appear in any science fiction film is something of a wonder His first response on seeing the script was reportedly Oh crumbs this isn t for me He enjoyed the script sufficiently however that he changed his mind More so than even actors like Olivier or Gielgud Guinness has been selective of his parts and his presence in this film puts STAR WARS in fine company Peter Cushing was then as he is now perhaps the most accomplished and beloved of actors specializing in fantasy roles Another unusual touch is the pacing The audience comes in with the story already in progress The viewer has to catch up by reading the screen explanation rolling by then is immediately tossed into the action This requires more from the audience but that is far better than boring the audience with slow introductions This style borrowed from internal chapters of serials might not work well outside of the fantasy genre but captures audiences very effectively here It seems then that STAR WARS was an innovative film every bit as much as was CITIZEN KANE Had this much innovation been lavished on a mainstream film it would be considered an artistic triumph As it was it was a box office champion an accolade that perhaps meant even more at least to its backers I would like to conclude this discussion with a comparison of the Star Wars films which purport to be a continuation of the same story but which I consider to be stylistically inferior to the first film I will continue to call it STAR WARS incidentally in spite of the retitling to STAR WARS A NEW HOPE When George Lucas made STAR WARS he had little expectation that it would become one of the most popular films ever made In some ways that contributed to the artistic achievement In the later films he knew what had worked well in the first film and could consciously repeat and effectively milk it In the first film the line I ve got a bad feeling about this was used and got a positive audience reaction It even appeared on humorous buttons people wore at science fiction conventions It was a good line but its popularity prompted it to be used twice in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Each of the STAR WARS treats aliens in a different manner but the first film is by far the most satisfying treatment In that film robots intelligent non humans INH and humans all interact in roughly the way people of different origins interact in New York City STAR WARS takes place in a sort of melting pot universe We are introduced to many species of INH in STAR WARS The only new one to be added in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was Yoda For that matter Chewbacca is the only other INH in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK Gone is the melting pot universe It was however back with a vengeance in RETURN OF THE JEDI In a documentary made by Lucasfilm it was claimed that George Lucas was never happy with the aliens in STAR WARS and he was finally able to create the effect he wanted for RETURN OF THE JEDI True there were more aliens in RETURN OF THE JEDI but they were stupid ideas for aliens While the aliens in STAR WARS were misshapen creatures designed by Ralph McQuarrie Ron Cobb and Rick Baker RETURN OF THE JEDI featured aliens like Sly Snoodles a singing elephant with lips on the end of her nose Also there is Salacious Crumb a rather obvious muppet who looks like he would be more at home on FRAGGLE ROCK than in a major motion picture And who can forget the dancing fat woman Of somewhat higher quality are the pig guards but they are reminiscent of Earth creatures and look like something out of a fairy tale Only Jabba the Hut seems sufficiently alien and he resembles a caterpillar The aliens are cute and not crisply done like the creatures in STAR WARS And speaking of cute Lucas at one point said the third film would take place in large part on the Wookie planet But Wookies would not have made very good toys and certainly not new toys so Lucas reversed the syllables in Wookie and got Ewok a lovable merchandisable teddy bear Most fans over the age of ten get a little sick at the thought of Ewoks There is also a question of realism In the first film we see a guerilla attack on the Death Star the second has the Empire crushing a rebel base the third has the killing of Jabba and his crew and the Empire fighting the teddy bear Ewoks So in which of the three films do we see the greatest number of allies of the rebellion killed By far the answer is the first film Not even counting Lars and Beru who were innocent bystanders more allies were killed in the attack on the Death Star which was done reasonably realistically than in all the battles in the later films In RETURN OF THE JEDI one Ewok is apparently killed I think and one is knocked out by his own bolo Very few good guys are killed in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in spite of the apparent darker tone of the second film Because of all the points mentioned above and because so much more of Lucas s creativity went into the first film for which a universe was created the other two films just used and only in minor ways amplified on this universe I still contend it was the best of the three films and will remain the Star Wars film most people will remember In 2077 it will be the best remembered Star Wars film
0061,Ishtar,1987,Monday night while most of the world seemed to be on interstate roads I took time out to see ISHTAR at my local theater where everyone that wasn t on an interstate road was watching BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 And yes I do go to movies that are younger then 10 years old in spite of comments made about the quote of the week contest Be that as it may I found ISHTAR to be an extremely funny and enjoyable film The acting by Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty was excellent and I found both of their characters to be believable The plot was consistent funny and wonderfully stupid The supporting roles were well played especially by Charles Grodin who has replaced Fletcher Daniels of Hill Street fame as my favorite sleaze Of course the question that everyone has been asking is Was it worth 50 million dollars I don t know I only had to pay 5 00 And my last little flip remarks bring me to the other point of my article and that is what the critics and here I mean the newspaper and TV critics not my fellow reviewers on the net have been doing to this movie which seems to be disliking it for how it was made instead of what it contains To date the negative reviews that I have read complain about how much the movie cost and how they felt that it was unbelieveable that Hoffman would be the lady s man and Beatty would have such trouble with women Let me address these issues The cost of the making of the film is irrelevant to us watching it unless they try to recoup the money by charging us 17 38 to get in Seriously do you care if the movie you are watching cost 5 million to make or 50 million or 500 million Do you sit there saying I paid my 5 00 now show me 50 million dollars worth of entertainment If so then I m sorry for you for you should like the movie for what it is not what is cost If they cut corners and the cheapness of a set or a costume gets in the way of your enjoying a scene fine but I know I don t sit around thinking boy for 50 million dollars that camel should be bigger or better then it is Point 2 about the characters that Beatty and Hoffman play I wonder if the critics saw the same movie that I saw Hoffman plays a man from the Bronx that lived with his parents until he was 32 He is very insecure and tries to cover it up with bravado There is the scene where he tells Lyle Beatty s character that he hopes he doesn t hate him since everything about him is phoney right down to his nickname Hawk Hoffman plays Hawk as a cocky s o b who really doesn t believe in himself but figures if he can get someone else to believe in him then things will work out He does an excellent job with the character Beatty plays a tall good looking hick from Texas He is not used to the big city he is uncomfortable around it and he has never dated another woman other then the one that he married when he was 17 Of course he would be uncomfortable around women given that history If you can get it out of your mind that you are watching Warren Beatty up there you can realize that he does a very good job with the character of Lyle Lyle cannot acccept the fact that he might be attractive so he thinks of the things that Hawk is that he isn t and sees them as virtues I m too big Girls go for little guys like you Did you ever see a big sports car watch for that one it may pop up in my quiz contest someday I don t know about the rest of you but I have had a number of friends who were fairly good looking that just couldn t accept their looks and you felt like shaking them to get them to listen Okay the long and short of it I thought ISHTAR was a funny well acted and totally enjoyable movie which I highly recommend If you like your comedy on the chuckle and snicker side it will appeal to you although it does have some good belly laughs too Give it a chance for its own merits and don t not see it for things reasons that are not important
0062,Ishtar,1987,I went and saw a 40 million dollar movie today but guess what it only cost me 4 50 And I adored it I call that a deal What s scary is that I almost didn t see this film because of all the negative reviews Most critics branded ISHTAR a barely humorous overly costly disaster Why should they care what it cost to make they were paid to see the movie In the past a consensus thumbs down may very well have kept me from a new release there are so many films popping up even a religious movie goer like myself needs some screened input but this is straw that breaks the camel s back What are you guys blind ISHTAR had me laughing hysterically not only were the performances genuine and the characterizations humanly animated but it created two characters that I could care about which I am finding to be a unique trait that usually evades films today Yet one of the comments I have heard most frequently from critics was that they found ISHTAR to be poorly cast therefore making the characters unbelievable there can not be a more inaccurate statement Beatty was magnificently convincing as the stiff southern klutz who has a hard time attracting women sure he is Warren Beatty but HE S AN ACTOR And in ISHTAR he proved to me that he is a good one As far as Dustin Hoffman goes I ve never not believed a performance of his and here it applied threefold There were scene where he almost made me fall out of my seat The two of them were spectacular together Not to mention that whey they re not on the screen the supporting cast led brilliantly as usual by Charles Grodin unerringly complements the shinning appeal of this always outrageous sometimes chaotic and oftentimes sincerely human adventure comedy Well even though I feel that I can t say enough about ISHTAR I have said my piece Also in a way I must thank all the reviewers that blackballed the film Thanks to your critiques coupled with the timely release of BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 which incidentally I loved too I was able to view ISHTAR in a relatively unpacked theatre free from all the annoying audience banter that has been making weekend movie going an unpleasant experience in my area recently But that is another argument and possibly another article See ISHTAR for yourself it s a very complete good time
0063,Untouchables The,1987,5 Do you appreciate a script which NEVER makes you wince and which consistently concocts novel interesting approaches to pedestrian material and manages to take several surprising turns 9 Can you tolerate realistic bloodshed in the service of terrific action 10 Do you respond to a little food for thought subservient to action If you answered positively to the majority of these questions have I got a movie for you Not a film mind you a MOVIE Where the story is brisk and important where the killings are mean where the scenery is from another world where the characters are bigger than life where the actors are stars If you just got lost in thought thinking about the last time you saw something like that then have I got a movie for you The story Al Capone is running Chicago Elliot Ness comes in to stop him forms the Untouchables and gets his man This is probably Brian DePalma s best movie Not his most daring perhaps but the one in which he matures into a director who puts his talent at the service of the picture instead of his visual ego He gets support in all departments ranging in quality from first rate to brilliant Kevin Costner finally gets the lead role he deserves and performs to perfection in a difficult characterization which must humanize a man who in our cynical times we can only describe as a crusading supercop Sean Connery as a member of his team inhabits his role completely as an aging beat cop who signs on with Ness Robert DeNiro is once again perfect as the publicly genteel privately brutal Capone Ennio Morricone s score does it again with just the right touch of bombast Whoever was in charge of the production design also deserves a round of applause for a consistently evocative detailed 30 s And the cinematographer captures it all beautifully Finally David Mamet s script has to be singled out It absolutely puts the run of Hollywood writing to shame recalling the days when screenwriters were writers first and Hollywood deal chasers second His story is solid his turns of plot surprising his dialogue crisp and right his characters walking perfectly that thin line between interesting complexity and mythic stature Best of all he manages to insert one of the most compelling subtexts in some time underlining with three or four clever juxtapositions the presentation and willing even eager public acceptance of a face of witty gentility on a reality of horrid brutality The public s eagerness to believe in Al Capone as a kind of public servant provides much of the underlying dramatic tension in Ness s efforts but leaves the viewer with much to think about But that s all too serious When you come right down to it THE UNTOUCHABLES is terrific entertainment The tension starts early and reaches a feverish peak in a train station shootout that is DePalma s greatest set piece which is saying a lot How successful is it Put it this way it contains a blatant steal from Eisenstein s Odessa Steps sequence in POTEMKIN and DePalma GETS AWAY WITH IT In spades All in all a piece of Hollywood magic that reminds you of what Hollywood is really capable of when it is of a mind to do it A clear 3 on the Leeper scale Caveat you should know that DePalma s affection for bloodletting is in evidence here though in comparatively restrained measure That is it s nothing like that in SCARFACE But if the sight of blood makes you ill don t say I didn t warn you
0064,Untouchables The,1987,There are lots of ways to make a gangster film You can make it as realistic as THE GODFATHER or as romanticized as A POCKET FULL OF MIRACLES You can do a BONNIE AND CLYDE where the crooks are giants and the cops are midgets or you can make the crooks vermin and the cops squeaky clean personifications of purity and virtue as was done in THE FBI STORY and the TV show THE UNTOUCHABLES Brian DePalma did one gangster already with tiny cops and giant hoods his violent but engrossing remake of SCARFACE He has returned to the gangster film with a movie based on the UNTOUCHABLES TV series and the book by Elliot Ness and Oscar Fraley that the TV series was based on His approach is romanticized to the point of being mythic The hoods are big and the cops are giants Even a mousy accountant for the Treasury Department who is impressed into service turns out to be a giant And a film adaptation of a TV show surprisingly turns out to be giant too The story should come as no surprise to anyone An ambitious Treasury agent Elliot Ness played by Kevin Costner comes to Chicago to bring down an oily Al Capone played by Robert DeNiro When he realizes he is still wet behind the ears he calls for the assistance of one good Irish cop played by Sean Connery and with the help of a few friends they set about hewing down the biggest tree in the underworld jungle When the film works best mostly in the first half of the film it is a positive joy Toward the second half I started to realize what I was enjoying is a story about the groovy side of the Secret Police and that Connery s honest and pure philosophy of law enforcement was actually a pretty scary thing But David Mamet s screenplay captures the fun of the TV series When Ness drives a huge snowplow through warehouse doors to smash up shipments of illegal booze you know you re watching the real thing eight times bigger than life Though admittedly the film s most exciting sequence harks back more to Westerns than to gangster films And the whole package is done to a score by Ennio Morricone sometimes tense sometimes flamboyant sometimes arrogant Now as for the film s accuracy yes there really was an Elliot Ness and he was a Treasury agent There really was an Al Capone and a Frank Nitti and they were crooks And Al Capone really was indicted for income tax evasion Of course most people knew all that already and Mamet and DePalma are counting on most people knowing no more than that because just about everything else is wrong Ness s accomplishments were exaggerated by newspaper accounts of the day and much more so by his autobiography and by the TV show Nobody has ever portrayed Frank Nitti accurately in anything Nitti was one of Capone s lieutenants whom the newspapers thought ran Capone s gang when Capone went to jail That squares with neither the TV nor the film version Capone s representation is neither accurate nor inaccurate We just don t see much of his strategy in the film But with all its faults THE UNTOUCHABLES is a big film an exciting film and it will likely be the big film of the summer Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0065,Prick Up Your Ears,1987,Summary This new movie directed by Stephen Frears THE HIT MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE chronicles the relationship between British playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell The story is humorously told through flashbacks and interviews with Orton s agent and relatives The sixteen years from the time Orton meets Halliwell to the time Halliwell bludgeons Orton to death are basically scenes from a failed marriage The frankness of the movie was touching although it might disturb prudish viewers I would rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale Frears begins the movie with the murder suicide which makes the viewer wonder about the causes of the tragedy The events which follow though hilariously funny at times are always shadowed by the knowledge that they are contributing to the couple s doom I was reminded of a movie called DANCE WITH A STRANGER about Ruth Ellis the last woman to be hanged in Britain She shot her boyfriend played by dashing Rupert Everett after a sordid and destructive affair In both movies the audience knows that a human time bomb is ticking away but is helpless to defuse it PRICK UP YOUR EARS which Joe Orton would pronounce Prick up your rear contains flashbacks taken from Orton s diaries and re enacted interviews with Orton s agent Peggy and with his sister Peggy is played by Vanessa Redgrave with a coolly satirical attitude My favorite line from the movie is spoken by Peggy as Orton s sister is mixing his ashes with that of Halliwell The sister was fretting over the exact proportion of the men s ashes that should be mixed in the urn Peggy calmly says to her It s a gesture Dear not a recipe Joe Orton is played by Gary Oldman and Kenneth Halliwell by Alfred Molina Both performances were unforgettable Oldman s wickedly charismatic smile when photographed in shadow mixed innocent boyish features with irresistible sexual appeal half satyr and half angel As he is watching the Queen s coronation on TV with his new roommate Halliwell reaches over and stroked Orton s thigh for the first time Orton quietly says This is a new experience for me television and grins rogueishly Molina was perfect as the frustrated and neglected wife Just before the murder he looks at himself in the mirror rubs his bald head and says I m an only child I was an orphan at 18 Bald by 20 I m a homosexual It s all the right ingredients for an artist So why is HE the success After he bludgeons his lover with the hammer he notices the award for the Best Play of the Year a human statuette on the desk He picks it up and said I should have hit him with this more theatrical The heart of the movie is about the gradual decline of a marriage as one partner achieves fame and the other is left in drudgery and obscurity Sadly it was Halliwell who was the bright young star when they began their relationship However near the end Orton was the acclaimed one and was getting a job offer from the Beatles Orton did not share the spotlight with Halliwell Perhaps it was fear of being publicly exposed as a gay man Perhaps Orton was selfish actually he did seem to be quite selfish Halliwell suffered in neglect and abuse and he blew up There are many more wonderful details in this tragic story which I recommend highly to anyone who enjoys black comedies I believe that this movie is Stephen Frears best of his works that I have seen
0066,Prick Up Your Ears,1987,Capsule review The true story of the homosexual relationship of successful playwright Joe Orton and his equally talented but much less successful wife Kenneth Halliwell This is a solid dramatic film and one of the year s best It would be nice to feel that success is a matter of talent alone but clearly charisma and luck have a hand also PRICK UP YOUR EARS is about two men lovers who appear to be about equally talented One makes it as an award winning playwright one is doomed to fail at whatever he puts his hand to PRICK UP YOUR EARS is the story of Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell s relationship and how it is affected by Orton s success We see the story in flashback after Halliwell murdered Orton and then committed suicide Orton was a popular playwright whose death in 1967 caused a stir particularly after it was revealed that he had had a longstanding homosexual relationship with Halliwell PRICK UP YOUR EARS is based on a biography of Orton which in turn was based on Orton s diaries The film flashes back and forth as Orton s biographer played by Wallace Shawn interviews Orton s agent Peggy played by Vanessa Redgrave The flashbacks themselves jump around in time a bit but generally tell the story from when Orton and Halliwell met in acting school to their deaths Though there was not much difference in their ages at the beginning of their relationship Halliwell was more sophisticated In a dramatic scene in acting school Halliwell shows himself to be more imaginative than his classmates and perhaps a bit disturbed He seduces Orton and starts a life collaborating with him as well as living with him After each spends six months in prison for defacing library books Peggy takes notice of Orton s writing and guides him to success while Halliwell is left behind Alfred Molina plays Joe Orton Molina previously played sociopath Sid Vicious in SID AND NANCY Joe Orton matures into a very different sort of person than Sid Vicious Based on clips I have seen from SID AND NANCY I am as impressed as the critics were with Molina s versatility But perhaps because it is a less appealing role most critics I know of have under praised Gary Oldman as Halliwell The withering of his self respect is what makes this film and he deserves more attention than I am seeing him get In any case PRICK UP YOUR EARS gets a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Look for Oscar nominations for this film
0067,Believers The,1987,I just saw THE BELIEVERS last night Overall impression pretty scary The film details the involvement of a police psychiatrist Martin Sheen in a string of grisly crimes which involve an ancient Caribbean religion The pace escalates as Sheen s family become threatened and the power of the forces against him become overwhelming The actors are excellent Sheen Helen Shaver and Robert Loggia head the cast the plot and direction are strong and the story is quite compelling My only complaint is the apparent cuts they made in the original story from a book called THE RELIGION which show up as incongruous elements in the movie Several small things and a few large ones seem to be stressed in the early parts of the movie which turn out to have no real impact at the end This could just be a case of intended misdirection although I ll have to read the book to be sure As for gore the movie is discreet by current standards some mutilated animals though there is one scene which got to me even though I saw it coming Definitely not for young kids If you liked ANGEL HEART you should like THE BELIEVERS A 2 5 on a 4 4 rating
0068,Believers The,1987,Capsule review Ugly unpleasant urban horror film about a voodoo like religion in New York City There is nothing original or creative and little enjoyable in the film If John Schlesinger can make films like MIDNIGHT COWBOY that s really what he should be doing There hasn t been a horror film like THE BELIEVERS in a while After ROSEMARY S BABY and especially after THE EXORCIST there were several horror films in modern particularly urban settings To make a film seem more believable and immediate it was set in a contemporary city setting THE SENTINEL worked that way so did THE WOLFEN There was even a weekly urban horror TV series KOLCHAK THE NIGHTSTALKER Then along came Stephen King who usually uses small towns for his settings Consciously or not film producers followed suit Setting is of course only one of many factors in what makes a horror film but it does a lot to set the tone and THE BELIEVERS somehow feels like a throwback to the NIGHTSTALKER series sort of horror story with definite echoes of ROSEMARY S BABY and BURN WITCH BURN An African based religion Santeria is creeping into New York City Santeria is voodoo like and calls for blood sacrifices of chickens and other small animals It may also call for human sacrifice There have been bodies of young boys found who appear to have been sacrificed in a brutal manner When a policeman is suspected of taking part in Santerian ceremonies Martin Sheen a police psychologist is called in Sheen becomes involved in the investigation of the murders THE BELIEVERS does something quite difficult In spite of a muddled and confusing plot it is predictable Just about every surprise in the film telegraphs itself well in advance There is almost nothing original or inventive in the entire film Most of the horror impact of the film comes from scenes of mutilated animals There is one effective makeup effect which produces as much nausea as fear in the audience Director John Schlesinger had previously done films like BILLY LIAR DARLING FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD MIDNIGHT COWBOY DAY OF THE LOCUST and MARATHON MAN These are not schlock films Schlesinger can make very good films MARATHON MAN shows that he can do very good suspense films However my advice to him would be that less talented directors than him can do a better job with horror few can make a MIDNIGHT COWBOY or even a MARATHON MAN He should make films but stay away from horror Rate THE BELIEVERS a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0069,Witches of Eastwick The,1987,Capsule review Broadband supernatural comedy has insight slapstick violence horror special effects sophisticated comedy profanity a monster vomit scenes Jack Nicholson Michelle Pfeiffer Susan Sarandon and Cher For fans of six or seven of the above only John Updike is a prize winning writer of serious literature about people finding their identities and that sort of thing His masterwork was his trilogy of novels RABBIT RUN RABBIT REDUX and RABBIT IS RICH There was something of a stir when he wrote THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK about three women in a provincial Connecticut village who have a brush with a warlock People thought he was too good a writer to fall back on the fantasy market My guess is that it was a calculated financial move I have no figures but I d be surprised if it was not his most profitable book Now THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK has been adapted into a film by George Miller you know the man who directed the Mad Max films Add a musical score by John Williams a cast like Jack Nicholson Cher Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon and makeup by Rob Bottin THE HOWLING and you ve got one heck of a motley crew contributing to a movie With a crew like this you might expect a film that is something of a hodge podge That s pretty good expecting on your part This film is an incredible hodge podge in fact The film can t decide if it is light fantasy horror soul searching literature comedy Peyton Place or what I would use a cliche like This film throws in everything but the kitchen sink but it wouldn t be quite true Instead I ll say this film throws in NEARLY everything including the kitchen sink Warlock Jack Nicholson I forget his character s name breezes into a provincial Connecticut town after he is wished to do so by three unattached women played by Pfeiffer Sarandon and Cher He takes up residence in an old house where witches were once burned Pretty hard to find Actually only one person in North America was ever sentenced to be burned for witchcraft He escaped Salem has a very small witch hunt compared to what used to go on it Europe and all the Salem witches who were executed were hanged The three women have simultaneous affairs with Nicholson and all seem to be taking it amicably Then things start to sour Nicholson glides through his part sometimes impishly childlike often ranting and bellowing like Ralph Kramden The three women are believable in their parts and perhaps more realistic than most women in witchcraft films but don t look for them at Oscar time The film has some powerful scenes of evil some seem inspired by SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES but as good an actor as Nicholson is he never rises to the malevolence of Jonathan Pryce in SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK has its moments but they do not add up to one whole movie of any kind It has something for everyone but it will have enough of anything only for real fans Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale P S To save having everyone e mailing me Nicholson s character s name yes I do remember it but it s an inside joke
0070,Untouchables The,1987,It strikes me as appropriate that THE UNTOUCHABLES comes out approximately ten years after STAR WARS opened because this film belongs to a tradition that began with George Lucas s classic space opera the high charged Summer Spectacular nit pickers could argue that Spielberg s JAWS began it all but there was too many lackluster summer seasons between JAWS and the next blockbuster hit STAR WARS for me to set the origin at that point This is a film that is purely entertainment with elements and composition that brings viewers back for that most essential blockbuster ingredient repeat viewings Since STAR WARS studios and filmmakers have tried like cinematic alchemists to come up with the proper incantations that will give them another summer megahit on their hands THE UNTOUCHABLES is the latest attempt and may very well be the film that manages to get the ring for this summer Which is fine from my perspective because THE UNTOUCHABLES is a pretty good film and is certain to entertain you unless you MUST see something original and touching every time you visit the theater I think the best way to think of this is that you re going to see a 30 s Warner Brothers crime film updated with modern violence cinematography dialogue very good dialogue and a moral dilemma to keep those of you who need that kind of conflict happy The film opens with Elliot Ness Treasury Department agent coming to Chicago with orders to work with the Chicago Police to tear down Al Capone s criminal empire Due to corruption and lack of enthusiasm by the police Ness decides under the counseling of an older cop named Malone to form a small strike force which will take Capone on And for the rest of the movie they do As I said before since this is almost a homage to the gangster pics of yore the ingenuity of the plot isn t what s going to enthrall you it s the atmosphere how well does the filmmaker bring you into the genre without moments of self consciousness about what s going on Brian DePalma has done a magnificent job in that category from the script to the cinematography to the music to the shot by shot composition of the sequences David Mamet has come up with the sort of pithy witty dialogue that bubbles only out of movie characters mouths The cinematography is some of the best I ve seen all year with wonderful point of view shots that swoop down on Capone s meetings and sweep into beautifully restored Chicago streets The film has just the right amount of sepia color to it giving the feeling of period without making you feel that the movie is encased in amber The Ennio Morricone music is perfect for carrying the enthusiasm and suspense that is appearing on the screen But most of all DePalma s direction is tight yet full of imagination there are sequences here which really carry you along with the plot that get you excited simply from the way that they re shot It is really refreshing to see after so many films that use boilerplate composition The camera serves the plot but it also serves the purpose of film to see in ways that we don t normally see The acting is adequate if not inspired the roles are played effectively but none stands out as a knockout performance the story comes first and the story calls for villains and heroes not complex characters Ness himself is the only person in this movie who questions what he is doing but his emotional turmoil over doing what is right without letting the end justify the means takes a back seat to the action of the film Costner does not play Ness as a bright man he is serious somewhat lacking in a sense of humor and has a righteous attitude which sometimes sounds like something out of the BATMAN TV show Let s do some good The supporting characters while being even less three dimensional are supplemented with more of the outstanding highly entertaining dialogue and actions Vincent Canby is right I think Sean Connery hasn t had this good of a role in years and his lines are by far the best Charles Martin Smith plays the accountant turned gangbuster with his usual youthful exuberance Robert De Niro who seems to be specializing in great villains of late turns Capone into a charismatic brute he often sounds like one part politician mixed with two parts successful regional sales manager until a quick snap of violence reveals him for what he really is But the credit here has to go to DePalma for producing such an utterly riveting action suspense entertainment Very well done B 5 film P S Yeah I recognized the Eisenstein sequence too I was chuckling as I saw it build up as did the rest of the audience I guess film classes are de riguer in Seattle Every film critic in the country has seen fit to mention it in their column after all they don t want anyone to think they ve never taken a basic film class
0071,Predator,1987,Capsule review Arnold Schwarzenegger meets an alien with a cloaking device while on a commando mission in Central America Action films are pretty common but the concept of the cloaking device coupled with decent special effects are a boon When I was growing up and into comics one kind of comic I was NOT interested in was war comics I never read one though I was occasionally curious about the ones that mixed war stories with a science fictional element Typically some group of commandos would find an island they were taking was infested with dinosaurs If I were to read a war comic that would be the one I d want to read Well the science fiction war story has made it to the screen with PREDATOR To Major Dutch Schaefer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger it s just another job Schaefer makes his living by leading a crack commando unit in the jungle It isn t the safest way to make a living but it usually has a predictable level of danger and few really unexpected hazards Schaefer usually knows pretty much what to expect and what to be prepared for This time however Schaefer has flubbed it badly Schaefer and his men are not prepared for the hazards they are facing and they are paying the price in lives It isn t really their fault of course It s just that sometimes you face something you haven t seen before This time they are being picked off by an alien creature and because the alien can fade into the jungle like a chameleon they are not even seeing the something this time Twentieth Century Fox who cleaned up with two science fiction horror films last summer ALIENS and THE FLY have as their summer science fiction film this year a sort of RAMBO meets ALIENS You probably already know who Schwarzenegger is The title role is played by the 7 2 tall Kevin Peter Hall the Peter Mayhew of the 80s Hall is quoted as saying of his alien s fighting style An alien warrior wouldn t come from outer space doing old Bruce Lee routines I wanted something a little different from the standard karate Medieval combat seemed appropriate Right Well I m not really sure you can tell the difference What does set this film apart from pure throwaway action films is an interesting approach in the chameleon or more accurately cloaking effect In the first scenes when you see it you really are not sure what you have seen or how the effect was created When you can get a better look at the effect it is relatively clear how it was achieved but it is still a good idea The plot implications of a nearly invisible creature stalking the commandos are well handled Without the cloaking concept this would be a fairly low grade action film As it stands PREDATOR is an enjoyable action film reasonably well thought out I saw only one real inconsistency I don t think it will give away much to say that sometimes the alien can see human eyes and sometimes it can t Because the invisibility theme is well handled I give PREDATOR a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0072,Tampopo,1986,Capsule review High calorie comedy about one restaurant s quest for the perfect noodle soup Enjoyable comedy from Japan includes several comedy sketches unrelated to the main story but which help to buoy it up Are you into food I mean are you REALLY into food And when you get the food is it important that everything about the food be just perfect And just by the way are you really into Japanese food If so you will probably enjoy TAMPOPO a new film from Toho Studios Toho is known best in this country for having invented Godzilla and many of his tall friends They also made the best of the samurai films They now bring the plot of a samurai film and the subtlety of a Godzilla film to a comedy about the adoration of food Two truck drivers stop at a noodle shop somewhere in the outskirts of Tokyo Even though the ramen is mediocre one of the truck drivers finds himself in a fight defending Tampopo the chef He is knocked unconscious by five ruffians and when he awakes the next morning Tampopo has an odd request she wants our truck driver to become her master and teach her to make perfect ramen noodle soup Thus Tampopo begins the arduous and occasionally dangerous journey toward perfection in even so apparently minor a task as noodle making In this task details that seem minor to gaijin foreigners like you and me become very important The plot from that point forward advances much like a samurai film If thick noodles seem to make for a thin plot they do About half the movie is filled with tangential comedy routines that have little or nothing to do with the plot Some are funny some seem a little pointless to us impatient gaijin almost all are on the subject of food One may question if the world really needed a comedy dedicated to gourmet cooking particularly one that shows in detail the proper way to kill and drain the blood from a turtle But TAMPOPO is a diverting hour or so It is a pleasant mostly and forgettable film guaranteed to increase the business of local Japanese restaurants Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale Don t see it on an empty stomach
0073,Tampopo,1986,I have to give credit to the Japanese filmmakers over the last two years they are producing some of the funniest films to grace the Film Festival Latest in the rostrum and heavily recommended via word of mouth from NPR Pauline Kael is TAMPOPO a story of a widowed noodle cook a truck driver who seems to be John Wayne on the side a vagrant food connoisseur a churlish contractor with a heart of gold and a gangster who seems to be combining his passion for food and his passion for his sexy moll And gourmets Gad EVERYONE in this film is a gourmand from top executive assistants down to bowery bums Anyone and everyone will suddenly stop whatever they re doing and begin to talk in terms straight out of your local Best Places restaurant guide how the broth lacks sincerity but the noodles have guts Actually this film has a rather interesting construction not seen since some of the later Monty Python movies It has a main plot that of Tampopo a widow who runs a not very good noodle shop Two truckers one being the archetype of most Western heroes of the 50s help her give the bum s rush to a bunch of toughs and she is inspired to rise above her cooking inadequacies and become the best noodle cook in Japan The plot follows her through her training by her trucker friend her investigations into the secrets behind really good noodles and her various trials to get secret ingredients to bring her to noodle nirvana Meanwhile the film will suddenly wander from the main plot to various skits occurring nearby always involving food and usually involving the gangster with the erotic dinner ideas I have heard a lot of comparisons between some of these scenes and the famous sequences in TOM JONES while I don t think they re as entertaining as the sequences in JONES they re funny erotic humor seems to pass through the language barrier with flying colors Some of the other sketches are much funnier including a board room dinner at a fancy French restaurant The sketches don t interrupt the main plot of Tampopo the name of the aspiring noodle chef for too long and some but certainly not all are worth the side trip But the most interesting storyline is that of Tampopo and Juzo Itami has the wisdom to keep the center of the movie firmly tied to her apron strings A B movie 4 50 value with heavy recommendations to get to the theater on time this has the funniest opening sequence of any film I ve seen this year as the gangster decides to have a meal in another movie theater
0074,Witches of Eastwick The,1987,I m not sure I should be writing a review of THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK because I m not sure just what the hell pardon the expression was going on in it However I can express the most important observation I made of it i e I didn t like it If I had to summarize this film I think I d conclude it was an updating of one of those old New England folk tales of someone selling their souls to Old Scratch and how they try to get out of the deal That s the kernel of it anyway Tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women feminism the role of the devil modern reformers and friendship Unfortunately little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts they re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace Actually I think that most of the audience was even more confused than I was They came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy on the level of GHOSTBUSTERS and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones They laughed or tried to laugh at moments that were either barely funny or much more horrible than funny as if that could bend the film away from it s rather frightening direction Three women Cher Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfieffer live in Eastwick a small midwestern town One night while drinking late into the evening they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives In seeming answer to their idle daydreams a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be He soon shows evidence of mystical perhaps demonic power and his devotion to the women s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones Even worse when ignored his moods become ugly and he mistreats the women for spurning him Anyway the problems all three female characters are fairly uninteresting and several are cardboard stereotypes especially Sarandon s character We never get inside them never feel sympathetic to them because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland As for Nicholson well even The Devil needs a direction to go in and while Darryl Van Horne is the most interesting character in the movie due to the grace of the screenwriter and more importantly Nicholson s acting he still can t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague And then there s the special effects Not in themselves they weren t that good but their overuse I was almost positive until I saw the credits that THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK was either produced by Alexander Salkind who has turned out the slop named SUPERMAN II and III and SUPERGIRL because of the big name actors in dopy stunts or Stephen Spielberg after the 18th vomit scene and the Nicholson blown down the street stunt Nope it s another bunch of guys and directed by George Miller who has shown great skill with stunts special effects before THE ROAD WARRIOR Nightmare at 20 00 Feet episode of TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE but apparently doesn t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act F gawds sake guys this is JACK NICHOLSON Let him loose Let him grin demonically Skip the splitting earth and fake lightning Watching the scene where Nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll all I could think of was What a waste If you re going to use slapstick like that use it up on Pee Wee Herman Nicholson does what he can with the role and when he can find his bearings can be extremely good the scene in the church for instance but most of the time he seems a bit stiff as if he s not sure what he should be doing next And no wonder This script goes all over the map giving you the feeling that it d just love to be allegory but it s not sure about what maybe if you give it time it ll think of something So what is THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK A horror movie A folk tale A comedy A statement about women An examination of the religious right or comparitive morality I tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me watching someone regurgitate half digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms people the screen and ultimately the audience In other words a mess Grade D 2 00 if you like Nicholson enough to watch him here maybe 25 of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others
0075,Witches of Eastwick The,1987,I saw THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK on its opening weekend and I found it to be a highly interesting movie I would recommend it to moviegoers especially those who like their drama with a slight bit of comedy I would not in the least place this film in a genre of horror films since it is not horror as in FRIDAY THE 13TH you chose a part and its like First and foremost THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK is a drama which stars Jack Nicholson as Darrel your basic horny little devil as he states to one of the three Eastwick women Also starring in the film as the witches if you will are Cher Michelle Pfeiffer of LADYHAWKE and GREASE II fame and Susan Sarandon There acting is all quite good though I would not place it into Academy Award categories although I would love to be proven wrong The performance by another actor and actress the owners of the town paper are also quite good Nicholson of course seems almost natural in this role He has that somewhat demonic quality about him as shown in THE SHINING as well as a sense of appeal He seems so natural spouting his sexual intents to Cher and Sarandon If I were to chose any actor to be the devil I might very well have chosen him Like Cher says in one scene I don t find you the least bit attractive and you smell right to Nicholson I think it serves better that the Devil isn t a Bruce Willis Don Johnson or Tom Selleck type The Devil s charm should come from his deception and his silver tongue not from a great body and a huge sex organ As a side note on sex I notice they did not compromise any of the actresses by placing them in any nude scenes I think this was highly tasteful as well as adding to the overall mystery of what sex with the Devil would actually turn into Besides the violent acts the few shown and the needed sexually explicit language were quite sufficient enough to place this in the R category where a film like this belongs This is a movie for adults to enjoy as a movie without having pre pubescent children being in the theatre spoiling it Eastwick is your basic New England village a small community where church and school seem to be the center point Its newspaper is still publishing only local news and minor gossip It s quite a picturesque place Yet during a speech sermon by the school s sometimes lecherous principal a massive storm approaches and rains out the event Later it is suggested by the three divorced widowed women Cher company that they have caused the storm by thoughts of their own Subconsciously the women begin to talk of an ideal man which prompts the arrival of Darrel a mysterious out of towner who buys the old castle Soon each of the women have their own encounter with this devil who manages to seduce all three Further they begin to carry on activities which the town folk highly frown upon I particularly loved the effects done during the tennis game simple yet highly effective for the scene Of course once the women realize who they are dealing with and how much power he has they decide to beat him at his own game These scenes as do some others tend to be quite comic indeed Yet I could also sense some form of gothic horror in the final confrontation scenes I was surely glued to my seat I have not read the story by John Updike upon which the film was based but I would like to I found the story quite appealing and entertaining Unlike some movies I have seen this one was well worth seeing One final note wasn t the stunt with the cherries both sickening and humorous at the same time People at the showing I went to were both grossed out and laughing almost simultaneously
0076,Harry and the Hendersons,1987,I ve decided I now know what reviewers are trying to say when they say a film has an E T quality What they mean is Are we really going to treat the first thing we don t understand this way Will we poke prod cage and perhaps even surgically examine another living being in order to understand it Well until I m sure the answers to the above questions are no I guess people should continue to make movies about the subject At the risk of being scoffed off the group I m posting a few favorable comments about HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS While I realize Siskel and Ebert had nothing good to say about this film I enjoyed it a lot The film revolves around Harry a Bigfoot who is unfortunate enough to step in front of the Henderson s car as they return from a camping hunting vacation John Lithgow gives another very good performance as the father of the Henderson clan Thinking Harry is dead and seeing a way to make a few on the deal they load him on top of the family station wagon for the trip to Seattle home If only life was that simple The rest of the movie revolves around the family reacting to this new guest and more of the plot which I shouldn t reveal One plot twist I will give up is the fact that Harry is a vegetarian this leads to alot of funny scenes Don Ameche has a small but very good role as a Bigfoot expert The film also benefits from its setting in Washington and has great scenery If you liked E T you ll like this movie
0077,Full Metal Jacket,1987,Well the Vietnam War film seems to be with us at last While the war went on and for a good while afterward it seemed a taboo subject People and in particular film backers did not want to make films about so downbeat a subject With the passing of time some of the wounds have healed and we have some gung ho Vietnam films The RAMBOs and MISSING IN ACTIONs made it entertaining if unrealistic as the John Wayne films a generation earlier did for World War II Now serious Vietnam films are being made We had DEER HUNTER APOCALYPSE NOW THE KILLING FIELDS and PLATOON Kubrick s latest film is FULL METAL JACKET The film is the history of a Marine known only as Lt Joker played by Matthew Modine The story is the memories of Joker from the war and like memories it is episodic The first 3 4 hour of the film is the story of Joker s boot camp experience on Paris Island 90 of the words you hear during this story are yelled by Joker s drill instructor From there we follow John s early Vietnam career in some shorter episodes then the film ends in another long story Joker becomes a correspondent for the only newspaper the brass respects the military s own STARS AND STRIPES By their own admission all they publish is good news war news and stories about soldiers giving half their income to down trodden Vietnamese The war and in particular the Tet Offensive is seen from his ironic viewpoint While the film is not as exaggerated as DR STRANGELOVE it always has a tragic and usually a comic undertone The film starts bitter and funny like DR STRANGELOVE and slowly transforms to sad and bitter like PATHS OF GLORY Those are Kubrick s two best films and FULL METAL JACKET could well come to be accepted by many as his third best FULL METAL JACKET is not the Vietnam War the grunts saw That was PLATOON It isn t the war the Cambodians saw That was THE KILLING FIELDS The Vietnam War the middle aged right wing saw was THE GREEN BERETS If I ever figure out from whose viewpoint the was was seen in THE DEER HUNTER or APOCALYPSE NOW I ll let you know FULL METAL JACKET is the Vietnam War that the college kids who didn t go and a few who did saw As such it has some truths some distortions and more than a little nostalgia value Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0078,Full Metal Jacket,1987,Stanly Kubrick hasn t made a movie since THE SHINING making FULL METAL JACKET one of the most anticipated films of the year It would be a mistake to call it a me too follow up to PLATOON but comparisons between the two films are going to be unavoidable What they share in common along with APOCALYPSE NOW is the very real sensation that you have just lived through something There are images and emotions that will stick with you for the rest of your life FULL METAL JACKET is a filmic experience A skilled director communicates ideas which cannot be conveyed in any other medium This is not a narrative film so much as an intense slice of life work FULL METAL JACKET sets itself apart from other Vietnam films from the very start as the characters and the audience are first put through boot camp Dark humor and the patent absurdity of the filthy mouthed Gunnery Sergeant make for lots of laughs But the film takes sudden turns into the deadly serious nature of the job at hand As cruel as the basic training appears you can see it getting results I was exhausted by the graduation scene and I now understand better than ever before just how those deep bonds of brotherhood are forged between soldiers The action switches to Vietnam at the time of the Tet Offensive Our protagonist played by Mathew Modine is working for the STARS AND STRIPES newspaper He itches to see some action at the front Then the VC bring some action right to the front gate of his base at Da Nang We follow him into the most convincing and frightening war torn city I ve ever seen The climactic scene is not the usual big battle a temptation that befell even PLATOON but a chilling encounter with a sniper Throughout the film I felt the helplessness of the characters who were swept up in a war they tried to understand but could not More than any war film I can recall FULL METAL JACKET shows how truly complex war can be and how one could arrive at the conclusion that the only way to avoid a moral dilemma is to become amoral It is a wringing emotional experience tempered by Kubrick s black humor and unerring eye for detail Make no mistake this is a rough film with verbal obscenities and blood by the bucketload I am usually insulted and offended by screenplays which attempt to cover bankrupt dialogue with four letter words but this is the film where such language is mandatory The script was written with a good ear for the slang of the time and place Get a sitter for the kids and head for the theatre
0079,Project X,1987,The last time I watched John Badham s film WARGAMES at least I hope it was the last time I counted what I thought were technical errors in the film I came up with an average of one every 120 seconds When I read that the scripters of WARGAMES had produced a new film PROJECT X my excitement knew very strict bounds In fact I was not excited at all When I heard that in this film Matthew Broderick was causing trouble at an Air Force base on which experimentation was being done on intelligent chimpanzees I said to myself I even know that story I have seen it done as a play on PBS and read it at least twice It had to be almost the same story as Paul Zindel s Let Me Hear You Whisper That play dealt with a cleaning woman at a soul less research institute Scientists are trying to teach a dolphin to speak but it will talk only to the cleaning woman and then only when nobody else is around Our cleaning woman is incensed at the lack of co operation on the dolphin s part until she learns what defense uses the scientists will make of the dolphin if it does learn to talk After that her goal is to help the dolphin escape So I avoided seeing PROJECT X until it came down to 1 25 Then I decided it was worth that just to see a remake of the Zindel play My reaction if Paul Zindel were Harlan Ellison he would now be the major stockholder of Twentieth Century Fox PROJECT X was not the close remake I was expecting but the two stories are awfully parallel But in spite of that I have to admit I really did like PROJECT X and consider it a far better and far more believable film that WARGAMES The film follows one chimp Virgil from being trapped in the wild through being taught sign language by Teri played by Helen Hunt until Teri s grant is canceled to being taken to an Air Force base for experimentation purposes There a ne er do well Air Force brat Jimmy played by Broderick is given the job of caring for the chimpanzee subjects and discovers that Virgil can talk sign language Then the relationship between the two grows and the story follows predictable routes PROJECT X could have gone wrong in a dozen different ways but it doesn t The chimps are not entirely believable a little too human but are likable without being cutesey The film manages to give them distinct personalities no small feat While the science of WARGAMES seemed ridiculous PROJECT X is considerably more credible the experiment being performed might not have been performed in exactly the way it is portrayed but I suspect that similar experiments actually have been done and perhaps as early as the 50s What is hardest to believe about the experiment is that the Air Force would not already have all the data they need along the lines of the results of PROJECT X Director Jonathan Kaplan will be familiar to people who saw the documentary Roger Corman Hollywood s Wild Angel In a humorous interview Kaplan tells how Corman gave him his first feature film to direct NIGHT CALL NURSES and his second THE STUDENT TEACHERS Kaplan slowly worked his way up with WHITE LINE FEVER His most recent films such as OVER THE EDGE and HEART LIKE A WHEEL have gained much better acceptance He was chosen to direct her because of his ability to do spectacular action sequences on a low budget according to producer Walter Parkes Though insufficiently original in plot PROJECT X tells a fairly good story well gets a good acting jobs out of a bunch of apes and is surprisingly affecting Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0080,Weapons of the Spirit,1990,This is not a particularly good world or a good country or a good era for idealists to live in Cynicism is easily promoted in almost every moral and ethical area involved in our lives scandals in religion conflicts of interests in politics general apathy in dealing with what once were national ideals Humanism is also a difficult standard to hold forth on what with portions the world trying to kill other portions over religious political or ethnic differences Belief in good begins to wane after the constant bombarding of reports of mankind s inhumanity to itself and what little of it comes our way via the media is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism Pierre Sauvage lives in this world and this country and this era also He is a documentary filmmaker of Jewish decent and by his own account a fairly cynical human being During World War II his parents were on the run through France trying to escape capture by the Gestapo or the French sympathizers the Vichy government They were taken in and hidden by a group of farmers in the village of Le Chambon sur Lignon where Sauvage was born They escaped from there several months later and left for America but Sauvage grew up with a great curiosity about the people who had hidden and protected his parents and himself during a period when the rest of France were deporting Jews to the death camps His parents did not like to discuss this period of their lives so Sauvage began doing research on his own There was few if any documents to go on but as he progressed he came upon more and more instances of Jewish refugees who had been hidden fed and sheltered by the villagers of Le Chambon and its neighbors Five years ago he decided to visit Le Chambon and investigate his documentary WEAPONS OF THE SPIRIT is the result of his investigations Sauvage attended the showing of his film at the Seattle Film Festival and talked about how the history he uncovered had radically changed his life and how he viewed the world No wonder I strongly doubt that anyone who sees this film can go away from it unchanged Between the fall of Paris to the Germans and the German retreat the lower half of France was ruled by the Vichy government a French government ruling with the permission of the Nazis The Vichy government took it upon itself to label persecute and finally export Jews to the death camps unlike other occupied countries which refused to collaborate with the Nazis in this task and forced the Gestapo to hunt for Jews themselves However in the south east section of France there was a small community where no Jews were ever exported What is more a large number of Jewish refugees were taken in fed housed and hidden from both the Vichy representatives and the Germans These people were strangers to the villagers of Le Chambon and its neighbors families fleeing from various threats and just passing through this part of the country Yet the people took them in and took more and more in as the war progressed These people were not paid were given nothing other than help in doing farming chores when possible and the thanks of people who were at that time used to isolation from those who were not of their religion Le Chambon sur Lignon had a population of approximately 5000 people and during this period they had as many as 5000 Jewish refugees hidden throughout their town and province That is approximately one Jewish family for every house farm or apartment in this area Sauvage talked to many of the older villagers who were involved in this conspiracy of kindness to ask how it was done how it was accomplished He asked one old woman how the refugee support was organized Organized she said If it was was organized it would never have worked No one person was the ringleader though the parish priest was instrumental in introducing a general moral conviction to his parish through his sermons this way no one person could be interrogated for the information Besides the providing of shelter and food and this was perhaps the most difficult part because many of the occupants of Le Chambon were literally peasants the villagers also managed to support a center for making forged documents for the Jewish refugees and schools for their children And through all this they maintained a united pacifistic front to the Vichy government and later the retreating German army Throughout it Sauvage continually asks Why Why would they risk the lives of themselves and their families go hungry at night spend their money supporting people they had never met and almost certainly would never meet again once they left Le Cambon Time after time after time these quiet smiling people would answer back approximately the same thing Why what else could we do It was the only thing we could do It was a tenet of our faith They all seemed to respond with polite surprise as if wondering how they could not practice the lessons of the faith that they followed Le Chambon and its vicinity is made up of the descendants of the Huguenots French Protestants who were themselves persecuted for several centuries previous to the turn of the century They are a very spiritual community but tolerant of other faiths the Jewish faith was practiced in sod houses and apartments throughout this period with nothing but respect and deference given by their Christian hosts And their history was full of stories of martyrs to the Huguenot faith decades later they would find that Le Chambon could still tragically produce those who would die for their religious and spiritual beliefs I am an agnostic and have become more and more skeptical of organized Christianity over the last several years but this film shows the caliber of people who practice the Christian faith in their every action who do not quibble over differences in the letter of their Bible but try to practice the spirit in which it is written I am glad to see such examples of what this religion is capable of I hope others will remember it when faced with the latest exploits of those who use Christianity as a vehicle of hate What is perhaps most unusual about this film is how it documents the infectiousness of the kindness practiced by these people While the Jewish population was hidden they were not being kept in basements or root cellars during this period The amazing solidarity of the entire community made it possible for these people to wander around if anyone from out of town asked they were told that these people were visiting relatives or people vacationing from the city The falsified documents were provided quickly and the surrounding countryside became a haven underneath the Nazis noses Moreover records show that Vichy officials assigned to the area people who had been assigned to live in Le Chambon from other parts of France regularly overlooked the refugees they could not have missed them many examples of this are given and sent in reports to their superiors informing them that no Jewish activity existed in Le Chambon Later when the Germans retreated through the town constant examples of the German Army looking the other way occurred with almost clockwork regularity It is as if the miasma of concentrated goodness of love overcame much of the prejudice and evil exposed to it so that many people soldiers who were butchers elsewhere seemed to put down their hatred if only for a time Unfortunately Klaus Barbi the Gestapo monster currently on trial in France finally got wind of Le Chambon He was not able to flush the Jewish community out for the Germans were finally being forced to flee from France but his henchmen broke in and captured and exported several groups of Jewish children killing the local people hiding them or shipping them off to death camps along with the Jews The parish ministers and the local schoolmaster would have gone to the camps themselves if it had not been for the local Vichy official who convinced his headquarters that these men knew nothing about any Jewish encampments in the area the official definitely knew otherwise And then the war was over the refugees scattered to the four winds and the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon went back to their daily world of growing crops and livestock They constantly seemed surprised that Sauvage came back to see them We didn t do that much we did what anyone would have done says one old man I find tears on my face when thinking back on this scene about this man s modesty and his assurance that the rest of the world has the quiet strength and courage of will that he himself possesses Sauvage thinks that may be the most important message that this film can pass on that it shows people ordinary people who are heroes in every sense of the word through their day to day sacrifice and their refusal to be intimidated into doing what is truly wrong and to remind us that we too have the potential and the ability to be as heroic as these people are What a wonderful world we would have if people such as these were truly ordinary As a film B As an experience that you should not deny yourself A I hope WEAPONS OF THE SPIRIT makes it onto PBS or to your local theater in the near future I cannot imagine not getting something positive out of this film See it
0081,Ping Pong,1986,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival PING PONG Great Britain 1986 Director Po Chih Leong Screenwriter Jerry Liu Cast Lucy Sheen David Yip Robert Lee Lam Fund Victor Kan I ll be darned Another A film to take its place alongside AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK MY LIFE AS A DOG and WEAPONS OF THE SPIRIT The name of this film is PING PONG and it tells the story of Sam Wong an elderly Chinese patriarch living in England who dies and leaves an explicit and aggravating will behind him Called in to supervise the carrying out of the will is Elaine Choi Lucy Sheen a young law clerk who is Chinese only by her birth she possesses little of the customs or culture of her native land and is forced to come face to face with much of these customs and the way they clash with modern English life through her efforts to have the will executed The story is told with a good eye for the humor of many of the situations she finds herself in as well as the clashes in cultures as Elaine tries to bring the threads of the deposition of Sam s wishes together Blocking her are Sam s two sons one ostracized by his choice of an Anglo wife the other because of his renouncement of Chinese customs he is a blatant Oxford man and he runs an Italian restaurant Also Sam s wife who wishes one son to take over Sam s restaurant and another to accompany Sam s body back to China Also a daughter by an earlier marriage wants to receive more than what she was given in the terms of the will and her husband who deals in illegal gambling wants to use the restaurant to further his games And finally a hilariously out of touch old friend of Sam s who thinks the authorities have been trying to extradite him for the last thirty years despite his citizenship Elaine must try to get both the signatures and the agreement of all these parties Along with the humor of the film several other elements compete for attention a strain of suspense in relation to the gambling husband and a large portion of mysticism which appears in the oddest places especially around a Chinese TV series about a Woman Warrior and the farm that the old friend of Sam s has inherited Finally there is the mystery of who Sam Wong was phoning before his death his body is found in a phone booth behind his restaurant However the clues in this mystery are not hidden documents or bloodstains they are touches of Chinese mysticism which lie just below the surface of the world Elaine finds herself in and she cannot begin to solve the mystery until she begins to acknowledge the existence of this Chinese magic Several plot threads seem disparate during the course of the film it is impressive how they are fused and molded into the delightful conclusion of this film The cinematography and editing of this film are wonderful I wouldn t have expected it in a film of this type I think that much of the Chinese mysticism would never come off it without the wonderful shots inside the church and the concluding scenes on the farm The acting ranges from good to suburb the latter in the actor who plays the elderly slightly out of touch friend of Sam s who thinks all Anglos are after him to deport him Lucy Sheen is not outstanding but her air of level headedness and slow delight in the people she must deal with are perfect for a character who is the central thread to this story It is an essential part and she carries it out well capably But finally the director Po Chih Leong must be given the greatest amount of credit for making the conclusion of this film so emotionally satisfying the past and the present cultures are resolved in both the characters and the mystery of Sam Wong s passing One of the best endings I can remember in months clever and tremendously satisfying An A film of any of the films at the festival this is the one I would like to see again soonest like RIGHT NOW I suspect that it may be better the second time around that there was enough cleverly hidden symbolism that I missed it the first time Perhaps not as emotionally satisfying as AMAZING GRACE AND CHUCK or MY LIFE AS A DOG but close and even more intellectually satisfying
0082,Innerspace,1987,INNER SPACE the latest release produced by Steven Spielberg is a fun two hour romp with the same flair that made BACK TO THE FUTURE such a hit The story involves a top secret military project to inject a miniaturized pilot and his high tech submarine into the blood stream of a rabbit Unfortunately the bad guys find out about the project and raid the laboratory just before the experiment is to take place A scientist flees with the miniaturized sub in a syringe and injects it into a unsuspecting nerdy pedestrian in a nearby shopping mall Soon the nerd hears a little voice in his ear telling him what is going on he is horrified to learn that he must retrieve a stolen computer chip from the bad guys in order to get the sub inside of him removed and reenlarged back to normal size As with his other films Spielburg borrows concepts from films in the past and combines them to make an entertaining movie The innocent bystander suddenly involved in political intrigue is pure Hitchcock the shots of the tiny sub in the body are reminiscent of FANTASTIC VOYAGE the high tech sub and the situations it gets the nerd into remind me of BACK TO THE FUTURE and the mad cap chase scenes are similar to ROMANCING THE STONE The mood is definitely light and there are numerous well done sight gags though at times the humor gets a little silly If you want a good laugh and can refrain from thinking too hard go see INNER SPACE The sneak preview audience I was in thoroughly enjoyed it
0083,Personal Services,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival PERSONAL SERVICES Great Britain 1986 Director Terry Jones Screenwriter David Leland Cast Julie Walters Alec McCowen Shirley Stelfox Danny Schiller This is unless you are rather prudish about sexual matters a pretty funny film but it really doesn t get rolling until after the first half hour so have a little patience Maybe I was expecting too much but with a director like Terry Jones of MONTY PYTHON fame and thus a god to me a writer like David Leland who did MONA LISA last year and Julie Walters the actress who brought EDUCATING RITA to life I was expecting some type of comedic Blitzkrieg It isn t that but it isn t bad either We open with Walters as a fairly rough woman who is losing her shirt sub letting apartments to hookers in the city Faced with financial ruin she and her friends a high class hooker and her transsexual maid talk her into teaming up into a service specializing in elderly kinky men harmless in themselves but liking to be chained to walls and pissed upon to dress up in womens clothes or to get into old school uniforms and be spanked by the headmistress Soon their business begins burgeoning to the point that they must find a larger place to practice business and they move to the suburbs and this is where the film really takes off While there are some funny sequences in the first half much of it seems to be trying to make a dramatic point about the dreams Walters has of a married life and the realities she must face in the real world The main theme of the film seems to be that tolerance of sexual eccentricity would make the world a better place I must admit I d rather hang around the people in this movie than Jerry Falwell and his righteous legion any day C for those who like bawdy laughs and can get by the English accents B for the second half
0084,Straight to Hell,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival STRAIGHT TO HELL USA 1987 Director Alex Cox Screenwriters Alex Cox Dick Rude Cast Joe Strummer Cy Richardson Dick Rude Courtney Love Dennis Hopper Grace Jones Elvis Costello Jim Jarmusch and The Pogues Certainly one of the most eagerly awaited films at this year s Film Festival was Alex Cox s STRAIGHT TO HELL Cox has produced two other films REPO MAN and SID AND NANCY which garnered both critical and popular acclaim especially REPO MAN STRAIGHT TO HELL was advertised as a return to the bizarre humor of REPO MAN combined with a satire of the spaghetti western popularized by Sergio Leone Well great plan and the sense of humor that Cox used in REPO MAN is much in evidence What s missing is any semblance of a plot if only to self lampoon as it progresses REPO MAN had a story unfolding which gave the bizarreness of dialogue so much of its bite The plot of STRAIGHT TO HELL reminds one more of CASINO ROYALE or THE CANNONBALL RUN it seems to be an excuse for guest stars to make minute cameos REPO MAN mixed fantasy and reality to produce a wonderful hybrid of new wave humor however the tiny thread of reality in STRAIGHT TO HELL is lost after the first five minutes which recount the exploits of three inept hit men and their shrill moll When they fail to fulfill their contract in Mexico due to oversleeping they resort to bank robbery and wind up fleeing to an obscure Mexican ghost town inhabited by a family of bandits merchants repairmen and hot dog salesmen who exist on coffee and expresso Yeah I know it sure sounds like a winner The rest of the film takes place in the village and here is where the film breaks down ANYTHING can happen it appears and thus insanity builds on insanity The implied satire of Italian westerns occurs in several scenes but most sequences just get their laughs from being strange in dialogue and behavior The problem with this is that the previous scene was strange the scene before that was strange etc There s nothing to play against like bouncing a raquetball against a wet sponge Not that there aren t funny parts I really enjoy bizarre humor and there are some outstanding examples in STRAIGHT TO HELL the scene where the the local hot dog man is forced to sing The Wiener Song at gunpoint would make anyone grin But this kind of thing is unrelenting and we really do need some kind of anchor or the whole thing generates into complete absurdity I WILL say that I d love to get the soundtrack to this film almost everyone appearing in the film had something to do with the music The Pogues in particular produced a wonderful opening theme that combines with some interesting optical effects to make the best opening credits I ve seen this year Cruelty and Abuse Consultant Most of the well known actors appear for no more than two minutes Elvis Costello Dennis Hopper Grace Jones and Jim STRANGER THAN PARADISE Jarmusch Of the other actors I only recognized Joe Strummer from REPO MAN the others are I suspect musicians I just don t recognize Cy Richardson Dick Rude Courtney Love This might make a good midnight movie or something to be watched under the effects of certain illicit substances but that s not enough to get a thumbs up from a pillar of the community like me D with affection but let me know if you find a soundtrack
0085,Predator,1987,Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a team of elite mercenaries through a Central American jungle to rescue a captured Cabinet Minister from communist backed rebels Along the way he deals with a treacherous CIA agent about a hundred insurgents and an alien sportsman doing a little trophy hunting The plot of PREDATOR is only a set up for the long hunt scene that takes up 3 4 of the movie Any reason to drop 5 or 6 heavily armed men miles from civilization would have worked just as well so little time is spent here only long enough to let us know who the good guys and the bad guys are and then one obligatory battle scene so Arnie can use his patented groan inducing corny combat banter Characters that started out as one dimensional Rambos are barely developed to the point of being two dimensional Rambos and most of the dialogue is so stiff and unnatural that the characters seem to be announcing important information for the sake of the audience rather then talking to one another Lines like You were my friend now you are a treacherous CIA agent What happened and He was my friend Now I want revenge are typical But that doesn t really matter because PREDATOR is not trying to present a soldier s experience These guys are not ALIENS grunts in space nor are they the regular guys in a horrible situation from PLATOON PREDATOR is about the local bare knuckles champ going up against an out of towner who s won his last 725 fights And on that level PREDATOR works well The alien s actions are believable and consistent with the idea it is a sportsman It treats the human characters like game animals stalking them down taking them one by one and taking care of each kill before going out again The alien is a competent though sometimes over confident hunter after dangerous big game and it behaves accordingly The thing that impresses me most is that throughout PREDATOR the humans have a chance Too often in movies like this the monster is unstoppable It is indestructible and omniscient until the last five minutes of the last reel when the hero finds some laughably easy way to destroy it In PREDATOR the alien is very very good but fallible The movie carefully portrays the alien as a real threat without making it seeming invincible The effects used to create the alien are another strong point While watching the movie you know that the alien s camouflage suit and blaster would work just as well as shown on the screen There is plenty here for the people who complain about Tie fighters banking and spacecrafts making noise to pick apart but it LOOKS real and that is the important part There are still some holes in PREDATOR The last scene of the alien mars the rest of the performance and I feel some of the characters are killed off a little to easily so they could get on with the final fight of Arnie vs The Thing But it works more often than it fails It s hard to rate PREDATOR since if you don t like this sort of movie this isn t the one that is going to change your mind so as a movie I only give it 1 on the 4 to 4 scale Die hard fans of action movies in the TERMINATOR style can take a 3
0086,Spaceballs,1987,Gary Rydstrom the talented sound designer who did Luxo Jr for us told me about his plans to record some laughing children for our next film He said it was going to be easy to make the whole day care center giggle just say underpants I can t help but feel that Mel Brooks is just as easy to amuse The best part of the dull HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I was the trailer for JEWS IN SPACE I had hopes that SPACEBALLS would live up to that promise Naaa This STAR WARS parody is mostly wee wee poo poo jokes Mind you there are some very funny bits and I did laugh out loud several times Rick Moranis is hilarious as Dark Helmet and John Candy has some choice moments There are flashes of comic genius which can almost make you believe this film was made by the same man who brought you YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN One measure of a movie is how far you get from the theatre before thinking about something else I couldn t think about anything but THE UNTOUCHABLES for a week after seeing it but SPACEBALLS barely made it to the parking lot I can t send anybody out of their way to see this one If you are an avid Brooks fan or someone who laughs whenever you hear underpants go right ahead Or better yet wait for home video It shouldn t be a long wait If you do see it I m sure you ll at least enjoy the sound design Gary Rydstrom worked on SPACEBALLS too
0087,Coming Up Roses,1986,This is certainly one of the more unusual films to come along during the festival a foreign language film shot in the heart of England In other words the film is about a community in Wales and properly the actors speak in Welsh with English subtitles The story is reminiscent of the older Ealing comedies of the 1950s it has the uniquely British low key humor that permeated so many of Alec Guinness s and Peter Sellers s early films It tells the story of the employees of an old movie theatre the last of five in a Welsh mining village that is slowly dying from lack of work The elderly owner is forced to sell it to a holding company and the projectionist a wonderfully honest character who has never wanted to do anything but show movies is forced to find work elsewhere along with the plucky concessions woman As they both vainly try to find a job that they think is responsible and watch their hopes of seeing the theatre refurbished and returned to its former glory die they become more morose until they come up with a scheme involving the vacant theatre with what they hope will allow them to make an honorable living This a budding romance some of the unlikeliest people you could mention and the old theatre owner s last wish make for an excellent bit of drollery which fans of films like A PRIVATE FUNCTION should enjoy The director of the film appeared afterwards and I admit that I enjoyed his discussion of the making of the film almost as much as the film itself It turns out that the theatre that they used for the film was in fact abandoned and about to be torn down it had been bought by the local bingo parlor so that it wouldn t provide competition However members of the town in conjunction with the director came together to get the theatre restored and it is back in business providing entertainment for a community where economic depression is a way of life It is the first film ever made in Welsh a project initiated by a government grant to create television and films for the Welsh audience He wanted to make a film that reflected the Welsh toughness of spirit that keeps their dignity and sense of humor in the face of intimidating day to day living conditions In that I think he has succeeded this is both an amusing and affectionate tribute to this country GRADE B for British understated humor buffs may be less appealing to those who prefer Benny Hill to Bill Forsythe
0088,Trancers,1985,TRANCERS USA 1982 Director Charles Band Screenwriters Danny Bilson Paul de Meo Cast Tim Thomerson Helen Hunt Michael Stefani Art La Fleur This film is probably familiar to those of you who have righteous cable service but to those of us who don t it s a mystery It was made before BLADERUNNER or THE TERMINATOR but it has elements of both Set in the future we have tough cop John Death Tim Thomerson tracking down Trancers mutants who can make weak minded people turn white froth at the mouth and obey their every whim rather like some TV evangelists I know of The leader has headed back into the past to kill the ancestors of the Los Angeles council thus causing their future offspring never to exist Death is sent back to the past to stop the plot and gets messed up in the kind of senseless violence you d expect in this kind of film at time having to out run bullets elsewhere almost being tanned to death Good maniacal fun lots of neat parts and a very clean plot that makes sense and is clever to boot It s a good idea to remember that it precedes those other two SF movies since so many of the elements are similar A grade of C B if you re at a midnight movie to see it
0089,Jean de Florette,1986,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival JEAN de FLORETTE French 1986 Director Claude Berri Screenwriters Claude Berri Gerard Brach based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol Cast Yves Montand Gerard Depardieu Daniel Auteuil Elisabeth Depardieu Subtitled This is the first half of what is being described as a French Epic it is an adaptation of a fairly well known French novel about the efforts of two bachelor farmers an older man and his rat faced nephew who covet the spring on the land of their neighbor After the neigbor is killed by the older farmer in an angry confrontation that is made to look like an accident the two farmers plans are thwarted by Jean de Florette the last heir of their neighbor and a hunch backed tax collector who has moved to the farm with his wife and young daughter to return to nature and start a farm Unfortunately for them the two farmers have hidden the spring on their land and are working behind the scenes to make their moves a difficult one This film had several features of interest for me It is about men and women who work the land and thus needs a director and a cameraman who can communicate the beauty and hardships associated with farming In that they have succeeded admirably using color to its full potential and employing wide shots of the land It is also a reminder of how cruelty can be generated by lack of actions as well as actions and how villainy is frequent among the petty and for petty reasons The two farmers are not sadists or vice lords they remind us more of the comic foils one finds in a mild English comedy They are absurd and sympathetic they are even worried about the neighbors they are attempting to force out Yet the consequences of their meddling are no less tragic This is not a complex story and it is somewhat long but the concentration on the land made it interesting to me for the majority of the film I also want to see the sequel MANON DES SOURCES when it is released in the United States An elderly French woman who sat next to me in the audience said she had read the book when she was a child and felt that the filmmakers had been very faithful so those of you who liked the book have a recommendation other than mine For those who didn t read the book like moi C 3 50 movie
0090,Good Morning Babylon,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival GOOD MORNING BABYLON USA Italy 1987 Directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani Story and Screenplay Paolo and Vittorio Taviani screenplay in collaboration with Tonino Guerra Cast Vincent Spano Joaquim De Almeida Greta Scacchi Desiree Becker Omero Antonutti and Carles Dance as D W Griffith Partially subtitled This was the much ballyhooed closing film at the festival made by the Brothers Tavianni who have gained such fame from films like KAOS and NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS an Italian American production it tells the story of two brothers skilled artisans who move to America to practice their trade They end up working in Hollywood attempting to work on D W Griffith s production of INTOLERANCE and to stay together I don t know what there is to compliment in this film The dialogue is usually in English since the brothers speak it after arriving in America but the dialogue is usually stilted with exclamations that seem unnatural and artificial The plot is too simplistic throughout most of the film and the characters seem to be something out of a Horatio Alger story D W Griffith is treated like a cross between Leonardo and Moses and INTOLERANCE is made to look like the ultimate statement of anti war sentiment it wasn t The brothers are broken up by moronic family pride which makes them look suddenly stupid and macho and this finally turned my sympathies against them one of their wives dies and they are no longer equal which causes the widower to leave for Europe and WW I This all winds up in an utterly and unintentionally hilarious ten minute sequence which was supposed to be a tear jerker but instead had the audience giggling uncontrollably The brothers meet up on an Italian battle field and are individually bayonetted by a fleeing German infantryman while they re bending over one another And then in their dying moments which are drawn out to a fantastic degree they photograph one another with a newsreel movie camera so that their sons can see them I thought part of it was based on a Monty Python sequence I remember but I can t be sure A fair to poor film ending in a truly astonishing screw up F Avoid
0092,Ceddo,1978,Capsule review Micro epic from Senegal The film is weak on style acting and pacing but has a really good story Never released in Senegal nominally over a disagreement about the spelling of the title but more likely for anti Islamic sentiments Imagine if you will a story written for Akira Kurosawa You know one with armies clashing and sieges of great castles Now imagine the story was done instead by a third grade grammar school class of about thirty people the same heavy themes but where Kurosawa would show an army the play has to use two people Instead of a castle there would be a tent You would get a sort of micro epic Okay now you have some idea what a micro epic might be Ousmane Sembene s 1977 Senegalese film CEDDO is a very big film on a very small scale The film based on a true story takes place in one village but it is still the stuff of epics In one small village in Senegal three cultures are fighting for dominance one worshiping the traditional village fetishes one the new Islamic faith and the third represented by two white Europeans Admittedly the latter are not so interested in converting souls as they are in trading guns for slaves As the power shifts back and forth more than one group decides it has to spend a few people on guns The real catalyst of the events of the film occurs when three anti Islamic villagers kidnap the daughter of the Islamic king This starts a small scale civil war that has a local band of Moslems allies of the Islamic king against the anti Islamic villagers attempting to oust the king and seize control for themselves Senegal s film industry is still a fledgling and this film in all but its plotting falls well below what we have come to expect as Western standards The pacing and acting are poor the camera work is only fair The plot on the other hand is excellent CEDDO is a film of political dialogue and philosophy and at times even action Much of the excitement of the action scenes is sapped away by mishandling Sembene is predominantly a novelist and when he made this film he did not have the filmmaking talent his story deserved It cannot be that hard to pick up the talents Sembene is missing Hundreds of directors in this country know how to get a reasonable acting job and how to make a film of minimal polish They just do not have a good enough story Sembene has a good story one that is every bit as good as the story of Z If Sembene could pick up a little polish in his style he could be making first class films As it is I would still give CEDDO a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0093,Full Metal Jacket,1987,FULL METAL JACKET is a disappointment After a rabble rousing first 5 10 minutes the absurdly funny drill sergeant becomes repetitive and boring The portrayal of a young overweight recruit s difficulty in fitting in is interesting at first but by the time all his comrades beat him senseless with towels wrapped with soap it becomes quite clear what Kubrick is trying to tell us about life and people This viewpoint is strongly echoed in the last few minutes of the film see below The fat recruit goes nuts who blames him and drills his drill sergeant with a 22 caliber and then drills himself What do we learn A mercilessly persecuted human finally takes the ultimate trip a murder suicide Is this surprising or revealing of human nature The critical scene in this movie occurs in a large abandoned structure which hides a sniper The sniper gradually picks off the platoon s members one by one as they enter Finally ensnared the sniper reveals herself as a pretty young Vietnamese girl who begs the platoon members to kill her The young Vietnamese girl I saw this movie with commented They show all the bad things about Vietnam and little of the good Kubrick s vision of war and humanity is certainly strongly anti war but as usual with Kubrick it may be anti human too Kubrick has never directed people well save for LOLITA and the movies before it Ever since LOLITA his movies have painted humanity as a depraved scared bunch of individuals unwilling to stand firm and take responsibility If Kubrick could once portray an individual showing the self same responsibility that Kubrick himself shows in molding his own movies to perfection then we would know what the heights of human endeavor could achieve We await such a character in Kubrick s movies
0094,Sweet Lorraine,1987,There used to be an ad for Levy s rye bread which said You don t have to be Jewish and the sentiment is appropriate for this movie as well The Sweet Lorraine of the title is a small Catskills hotel suffering from competition with ritzier places The plot is a simple one Molly Garber the granddaughter of the Lorraine s owner arrives to work for the summer and falls in love with the hotel while her grandmother is debating whether or not to sell and close the place What really makes this movies work is the small touches The actors are all wonderful making you believe these characters are really part of your own family Maureen Stapleton plays Lillian Garber the hotel owner and everyone s grandmother or at least favorite aunt She is surrounded by such quirky characters that there are plenty of laughs to round out the warmth It would probably take more than one viewing to catch all of the little jokes from the social director s aerobics classes to the inter hotel softball games the Lorraine s team is called the Lox Sox from the mahjongg games to the waiter who dyes his hair red white and blue for the 4th of July party Intermeshed with the fate of the hotel and the slice of life humor there are three love stories Molly falls in love with the hotel handyman who isn t Jewish but Lillian lets her get away with it Lillian herself has a lover Sam who runs the kitchen One of the nicest touches is the portrayal of Lillian and Sam s relationship which treats the love between two elderly people more respectfully than any movie since ON GOLDEN POND Finally there is the love affair between all of the staff and guests and the hotel itself
0095,Roxanne,1987,Summary Steve Martin plays Cyrano to Daryl Hannah s Roxanne in a modernized version of Rostand s play This is mostly a vehicle for Martin who plays a fire chief rather than a swordsman His physical acting ability is combined with some truly witty dialog making for a very funny performance Seeing this movie was a bit frightening to me I have to admit I m not very fond of Daryl Hannah and only grudgingly so of Steve Martin More important was my affection for Edmond Rostand s Cyrano which has always been a favorite of mine So called modernized versions of classic stories often need to be watched from between the fingers in something of the manner of a horror show But ROXANNE owes more to Rostand than I expected with many lines being taken directly from Brian Hooker s translation Martin plays C D Bales the chief of a volunteer fire department in a modest British Columbia village Despite his preposterously large nose Here we have a man who can please two women at the same time his wit and charm have made him the town s favorite son Bales s sense of humor is admired by all and his extemporaneous gibes can be awesome However just as with his beplumed forebear C D never jokes nor allows others to joke about his nose In an early scene when two athletic malcontents decide to taunt him C D s wit is released simultaneously with his skill at unarmed combat to leave both jocks face down in the dust Personally I found this bit deeply gratifying Hannah s role as Roxanne is perhaps the least faithful to the orignal She plays an astronomer spending the summer in B C for no real reason C D takes an instant liking to her but is too insecure about his looks to let her know Along comes a strapping hulk of a fireman Chris to join Bales s fumbling department He too is drawn to Roxanne but is so awfully insecure around women that he can t bring himself to speak to her His insecurities to the point of losing his lunch in anxiety are the film s weakest point Seeking help from his chief Chris talks C D into writing letters over Chris s name Various other means are used to coach him when he actually meets Roxanne face to face and as they say hilarity results In addition to the jokes based upon Chris s ineptitude and C D s nose the screenwriters have added a subplot not in the original This background story is really a set of running jokes about the training of the volunteer fireman none of whom who should even be allowed a book of matches These are mostly sight gags and very funny ones It adds a great deal to the film and meshes nicely with the main story It should be mentioned that the nose makeup which is subjected to several extreme close ups is superb A simple thing like a seam or poor skin tone might have ruined some very funny scenes and I m glad the producers made sure that this received the attention it was due This was a terrifically funny movie due almost entirely to Steve Martin s talents His physical skills get their chance as well though not to the extent they did in ALL OF ME If I only grudgingly admired him before I m a genuine Martin fan now Hannah s performance is about as dead pan as all her performances but she has a small role really and one can ignore her Certainly the funniest movie I ve seen in years and good family stuff I think 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0096,Mona Lisa,1986,This review was written last year MONA LISA was recently released on videocassette and since it had only a limited theatrical release I thought it might be worth pointing out People are encouraged to send me more reviews of lesser known films when they come out on videocassette ecl It has been observed that there are many foreign language films that could do much better at the boxoffice if they were done in English I think a prime example must be MONA LISA The film MONA LISA is done in British Cockney without benefit of dubbing or subtitles Now I don t speak any Cockney but many words are cognates and I can understand enough that I can usually pick up the gist of what is being said With this linguistic skill I found MONA LISA to be one of the best films of the summer of 1986 second only to A GREAT WALL To start with I am a Bob Hoskins fan from THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY and PBS s showing of the British FLILCKERS series and to a lesser extent from THE COTTON CLUB MONA LISA has the feisty Cockney actor at his best as a small time hood recently released from prison who gets a part time job chauffeuring a prostitute Simone She enlists his help to find another prostitute who is missing the hood who thought of himself as a bad man before gets a quick education in the world of prostitution and for once finds himself morally outraged The plot that ensues is worthy of a Dashiell Hammett novel People play dirty and rough And the background has an air of authenticity that Hammett often lacked Neil Jordan who co wrote the script as well as directed the film has a good feel for the characters he has created Hoskins s character is very real yet funny enough in ways the character intends and does not intend that he is a real joy to watch Cathy Tyson as Simone really has the mystery that the title implies This a A GREAT WALL are the must see films of the summer of 1986 Give it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale And if you need an interpreter for the Cockney maybe I m available I wouldn t mind seeing the film again
0097,Labyrinth,1986,PREFACE I read a lot of movie reviews in this newsgroup but I never see reviews of the movies that I see That s because I mostly see movies with my two young daughters these days When the kids spend 40 hours a week in day care I can t see hiring a babysitter while I watch PRICK UP YOUR EARS or BLUE VELVET in a theater All of the other people I know who are parents of young children have similar situations We love movies and we used to watch them but now our notion of drama is defined by Duck and not De Niro Our criteria are not so much Did I like it as Could I stand to watch it 57 times on video So I thought I should send in from time to time reviews of the movies that we working parents of pre school kids are watching Never mind that this movie was released last year and reviewed last year I ve now seen LABYRINTH 50 times and movies take on a very different perspective when you see them that often Like storybooks that your children want to hear every night the classic jewel movies become part of the family literary tradition and their characters and plot elements find their way into bedtime stories and playtime make believe LABYRINTH is such a jewel LABYRINTH was released in 1986 It was produced by George Lucas and directed by Jim Henson It stars Jennifer Connelly as Sara a scrappy pubescent girl who likes to play the princess in her junior high school play David Bowie as the white fanged Goblin King Toby Froud the 6 month old son of one of the screenwriters a few other random humans and several hundred puppets and creatures The plot is very gripping to my 4 year old and her friends entrancing to her 10 year old and her friends and delightfully silly to their parents Sara is bullied by her shrill stepmother into babysitting her half brother Toby She loses her temper and wishes for the goblins to take Toby away They oblige and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get to the Castle Beyond the City to rescue Toby from the vile clutches of Jareth the goblin king The castle is at the center of a magic labyrinth which presents her with various challenges and crises Along the way she meets some good monsters and some bad monsters the good monsters help her vanquish the bad ones and get to the castle where she outwits the Goblin King thereby enabling everybody to live happily ever after Sara is a wonderful idol for my daughters She is a very attractive teenage girl whose quick wits fearlessness good humor and perseverance enable her to beat the Bad Guys and save her brother Most children s movies have rodents or boys or boy rodents in the starring roles and it s great to have an exciting adventure film whose hero is a talented girl She s young enough that children watching the movie see her as a child but mature and intelligent enough to keep the attention of their parents The monsters are cute but inconsequential There is no memorable monster who steals the show like Yoda or the Tin Woodsman or E T but there are a bunch of cute monsters and low rent evil monsters My children had nightmares for weeks after seeing Malificent in the Disney SLEEPING BEAUTY and woke up mommy at 3 AM asking if Cruella was going to get them after seeing 101 DALMATIANS I had nightmares about winged monkeys until I was 18 But the monsters in LABYRINTH are basically just muppets and children trust them The evil ones aren t evil enough to scare anyone but they are symbolically evil so the plot works Also Henson uses the standard Spielberg trick of substituting disgustingness for evilness Slime and spiders yes cut throats and bashed heads no Children this age love slime and spiders but recognize that they symbolize evil David Bowie is just brilliant as the Goblin King He is evil but aristocratic menacing but musical He never lets you forget that he is regal while constantly reminding you that he is a devil He is evil without being frightening He holds the baby gently and lovingly while abusing ugly horned goblins The music is uneven there are a couple of memorable songs by Bowie that my daughters and I sometimes sing but there are also some stupid songs sung by silly monsters The sets are what you d expect from Spielberg or Lucas and are so rich in detail that I see something new and amusing every time I watch it This movie is a classic right up there with THE WIZARD OF OZ and PINNOCHIO Rating 4 gummi bears on a scale from 4 to 0 cooked carrots then 0 to 4 gummi bears Available on Laser Disc Super Beta and VHS
0098,Roxanne,1987,Capsule review Funny intelligent updating of CYRANO DE BERGERAC has something to say about the nature of beauty without ever failing to entertain Unfortunately Martin s script cops out at the end denying the audience the power of the end of CYRANO Steve Martin s new film has the best plot of anything he has done to date But the credit of course does not go entirely to Martin s screenplay In fact ROXANNE is an updating of one of the great plays of French theater CYRANO DE BERGERAC It is a good enough play that Martin could have coasted through his version and still have had a marvelous film Instead he broadens the humor and makes Cyrano de Bergerac renamed C D Bales perfectly at home as the ever perfect chief of the world s most incompetent fire department Bales has an old problem and a new problem His old problem is that he has an absurd looking four inch long nose That problem he pretty much under control That is because he is unmatched as both a wit and a fighter Nobody makes fun of that nose for very long His other problem is that he loves the new in town astronomer Roxanne played by Daryl Hannah Unfortunately Roxanne wants Bales only for a friend She really has eyes only for Christopher a handsome but vapid new recruit to the fire department Christopher is low brow and crude but is physically attracted to Roxanne Knowing he is too clumsy to woo her by himself he asks for help from Bales Bales coaches Christopher to say the things that Bales wishes he could tell her himself To be able to say to Roxanne everything that he feels Bales is willing to let Christopher reap the advantages ROXANNE represents one more step for Martin away from his off the wall origins and into making comedy of some lasting value Updating CYRANO DE BERGERAC was a clever idea and is one that works One complaint however when ROMEO AND JULIET was updated for WEST SIDE STORY it was the whole story that was updated They did not soften the ending Martin insults his audience by denying them the powerful and tragic end to the story Probably at the beginning he was planning to include it because he made Bales a firefighter rather than say a stockbroker But at some point he changed his mind apparently to make the film more commercial The film remains a light throwaway summer comedy instead of a powerful adaptation of Rostand that the final scene of CYRANO could have made it Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale Good but watch the Jose Ferrer version of the original if it comes up on PBS POST SCRIPT It may be of some interest that Cyrano de Bergerac really existed He was at once one of the greatest swordsmen and one of the greatest wits in France He did have a nose of prodigious size about which he was extremely sensitive He is also credited as being the first major science fiction novelist His VOYAGE TO THE MOON was the first real science fiction novel to use its concepts not for allegory but for sense of wonder He thought of on his own several means of getting humans to the moon most of which were absurd by modern standards but the one he invented for his book and which nobody is recorded as having thought of before was to use rockets Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz devotes the first chapter of his EXPLORERS OF THE INFINITE to Cyrano de Bergerac
0099,Adventures in Babysitting,1987,Chris is a high school senior from the suburbs of Chicago After her boyfriend breaks their date she agrees to baby sit the Anderson s little girl Soon after the parents leave Chris gets a call from her best friend Brenda Brenda ran away made it to the downtown bus station before her money and resolve ran out and wants Chris to drive into the city to pick her up The little girl and her love struck brother blackmail Chris into taking them and the brother s best friend along with her They climb into Chris s mother s car and head for the bus station A flat tire a missing spare and a forgotten purse leave them stranded and broke in a city that seems to be one large unfamiliar and threatening slum Chris s task is clear she must fix the car evade the murderous auto theft czar and get the children home before Mom and Dad get back from the party ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING borrows heavily from RISKY BUSINESS AFTER HOURS and FERRIS BUELLER S DAY OFF It is amusing with some genuinely funny moments but it s all been done before Another problem is director Chris Columbus writer of GREMLINS and GOONIES He paints this movies cute with a wide brush childhood innocence melts the hearts of hardened city toughs help is found in the most unlikely of places and the kids learn about people and about their own abilities The result has cloying sticky sweet feel that will disappoint anyone over the age of 14 ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING does have its moments the appearance by blue legend Albert Collins is almost worth the ticket price But there are so many decent comedies out this summer that unless you ve seen everything else it would be best to wait until ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING hits cable
0101,Innerspace,1987,INNERSPACE retells the FANTASTIC VOYAGE story this time going for and getting laughs Dennis Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton a washed up fighter pilot with an ego the size of a truck He is to man the first miniaturized exploration of a living animal When the experiment is interrupted by industrial spies Pendelton is accidentally injected into the rear end of Jack Putter a Safeway clerk played by Martin Short Putter is a nervous hypochondriac whose ego is as under developed as Tuck s is over inflated Putter with the help of Tuck s reporter girlfriend must recover the stolen microchip needed to reenlarge Tuck before Tuck s air supply runs out They are chased by villains reminiscent of a James Bond film captured by rival scientists and threatened by orange haired grocery shoppers INNERSPACE takes the elements of a typical adventure thriller adds some snappy dialogue and good special effects and skillfully creates a very entertaining movie More than once the whole theater was laughing out loud Dennis Quaid described INNERSPACE as a dumb stupid comedy and I love it We encounter every dumb stupid cliche in the book Leave your brain at home and you ll have a good time I took my brain along and thought INNERSPACE was great
0102,Dragnet,1987,Capsule review Parody of successful summertime action movies with Dan Aykroyd doing impressions of Jack Webb It is unclear how Aykroyd found out how Webb talks as he has apparently never seen an episode of DRAGNET Dan Aykroyd grew up in the 50s and 60s later in improvisational comedy he often drew on television personalities he saw during that time He is equally good doing Rod Serling from THE TWILIGHT ZONE and Jack Webb from DRAGNET Usually his parodies lasted just a few minutes on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE but his latest film allows him to do his impression of Jack Webb for an entire film The story c authored by Aykroyd is an extended parody of the DRAGNET TV series Aykroyd plays Joe Friday not the Joe Friday but the nephew of the Joe Friday Aykroyd s Friday for some unexplained reason has been able to inherit the famous Badge 714 from his uncle as well as the same clipped speech pattern and the same self righteous attitude While Aykroyd s impression of Jack Webb is pretty much on the money overall the imitation of DRAGNET is miles wide of the mark Aykroyd can talk like Webb but is a total failure at writing like Webb In the old TV shows sentences of more than four words spoken by anyone were only slightly more common than scenes of Friday shooting up heroin Stan Freeberg had a better ear for the way people talked in DRAGNET when he wrote for his parody the exchange Joe Yeah Frank I checked out that 38 Yeah You were right How so It was a gun The story of DRAGNET has pagan rituals gun battles armored tanks car chases female flesh a super villain airplane chases and cops in funny costumes all of which suggests that Aykroyd had a voice coach who actually had seen episodes of DRAGNET but that Aykroyd himself had never seen one and had spent his time watching successful but empty summertime films Take out Aykroyd s character and the only similarity to the object of the parody is that both involve police One wonders how someone can do so many parodies as Aykroyd has and still not have the slightest idea of how to do a parody DRAGNET is first a summertime throwaway film second an extended SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE sketch and is the parody it is purported to be third or perhaps tenth Give this one a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0103,My Beautiful Laundrette,1985,This is another retrospective of a film which had limited theatrical release and is just now becoming available on videocassette Also the director Stephen Frears has just released another film PRICK UP YOUR EARS ecl Capsule review A serious plot rife with unexpected twists combines with some nice comic touches to make this film about a Pakistani family a memorable one This film portrays some Pakistanis as having faults hence it is the center of controversy but it probably gives a realistic picture of what one extended family in London s Pakistani community might be like One of the most controversial films of 1986 is an apparently minor film that in this country is playing almost exclusively in art houses MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE was made for England s Channel 4 Pakistanis are picketing the theaters that show the film claiming that it portrays an unfair portrait of their countrymen What is it they do not like about the film Well MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE is a comedy drama about a young Pakistani who is caring for his ailing father and who goes to work for his uncle Saeed Jaffrey The uncle the family patriarch has the boy washing cars but then asks him to manage a run down launderette The boy instead offers to rent the launderette and run it for his own profit From there the plot gets pretty complicated If it doesn t sound like an AIRPLANE style comedy you are right This is actually a fairly serious film with a wide variety of comic touches salted in The film at once entertains and gives some insight into the structure and politics of Pakistani families and into the problems they face I cannot say for sure if it was done intentionally but the photography seems often to use three planes of action Something will be happening in the foreground midground and background of a scene The director orchestrates the three planes so your attention will be on one plane of action and you will realize a piece of humor or a plot complication is simultaneously being introduced on one of the other two planes There are few familiar faces in the film Saeed Jaffrey is best known for the role of Billy Fish in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING Another actor is familiar for having played Nehru in GANDHI Beyond those two the cast is unfamiliar but good So why the controversy over this film I think it is not because it misrepresents Pakistanis but because they are not represented as angelic After a long time of mainstream American cinema using blacks only as buffoons there was a period in which they could only appear in films as being nearly perfect These were films like A PATCH OF BLUE and LILLIES OF THE FIELD Even now it is unusual for filmmakers to show a realistic spectrum of blacks some good some bad MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE is the first major film to show much of the Pakistani community Some Pakistanis appear in a favorable light some in a much less favorable light I think as long as the viewer realizes that the people in this film do not represent traits of a whole nationality of people any more than the characters in RUTHLESS PEOPLE or PSYCHO III do the film will promote rather than destroy understanding of Pakistani immigrants Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0104,Quiet Earth The,1985,This film has recently been released to cable ecl In 1951 Arch Oboler made the film FIVE about a limited number of people who had survived a nuclear war Every so often Hollywood makes another film about the last handful of people in a post holocaust world Notable was THE WORLD THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL a 1958 film with Harry Belafonte and Mel Ferrer as the last people on Earth and of course in a love triangle The same situation arose in THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH a Roger Corman quickie made in 1960 In the 58 film an experimental super bomb apparently dissolved everyone in the 60 film something in the air did the same In a TV movie called WHERE HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE GONE a solar flare does the honors Most recently it was New Zealand doing the three survivor film THE QUIET EARTH is a film that very much resembles THE WORLD THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL Once again we have white man white woman black man as the last people on Earth with the two men competing for the affections of the last woman If this plot had to be done again at least it was done with quality filmmaking and some style The characters are better than the 50 s stereotypes of the previous film versions What sets this film apart is the force that de populated the world Since the explanation is the most intriguing part of the film I will avoid spoiling it here I came out of the film saying 1 the cause could not have happened 2 given that it did happen there could not have been any survivors 3 given that there were survivors what made the difference between who survived and who didn t is absurd and 4 given that what decides who survives really decides it is an absurd coincidence that someone who could figure out what happened was also a survivor A friend defended the film on all four points By my figuring he bested me on 1 and 2 tied on 3 and lost on 4 I still think the idea is impossible but it does bear some thinking about I do have a philosophical complaint about the film One of the characters feels terrible remorse for having worked on a scientific project whose results could have been used for evil I guess this is a natural outgrowth of a pacifist sentiment growing in New Zealand My question to the filmmaker would be just how much human progress could have ever taken place without anyone working science that could have been used for evil Most of my career I worked on a data network that could have been used by a repressive government for keeping tabs on its citizens The knowledge of how to immunize against smallpox makes it possible to infect your enemies at no risk to yourself Find ways to increase food production and you find ways to control others with the surplus No field of scientific research is entirely harmless it is just that most are less risky than stagnation
0105,Innerspace,1987,Capsule review FANTASTIC VOYAGE crossed with FOUL PLAY makes for another science fiction comedy cut from the same mold as BACK TO THE FUTURE INNERSPACE does not always make sense but it is just about always fun Spoiler warning major elements of the plot are presented first as minor surprise plot twists Read the following at your own risk Two years ago Steven Spielberg s production company had a big hit with a light science fiction comedy BACK TO THE FUTURE Success is not something that Hollywood takes lightly so presumably it was not long before Spielberg had a second film cut of much the same cloth on the drawing boards Well INNERSPACE is out and very probably it will be a hit of equal or almost equal strength INNERSPACE directed by Joe Dante is a light hearted film which can easily be taken as a prequel to FANTASTIC VOYAGE Tuck Pendleton played by Dennis Quaid is a right stuff sort of pilot who feels he never got the recognition that astronauts have gotten so he volunteers to be the first human to be miniaturized and injected into another creature in this case a rabbit Through an absurd chain of events he is instead injected into neurotic grocery clerk Jack Putter played by Martin Short who happens to be in the wrong shopping mall at the wrong time Pendleton must make contact with Putter and together they race against time to stop a weird assortment of freelance spies who want to steal the secret of miniaturization and sell it to the highest bidder One we are told has already made a fortune by selling the secret of Velcro to the Persian Gulf Pendleton s abilities to enhance Putter s own powers start impressive and eventually get absurd while the characters are really only superficially developed and at times are totally absurd At one point Putter takes time out from a race against time to do a little jive dancing around Pendleton s apartment The film sometimes relies too much on slapstick scenes and goofy chases but at other times it makes very clever use of its premise to create some exciting action scenes And the script does leave room for the Spielberg trademark malfunctioning mechanical arms and some Dante trademarks cameo roles by Dick Miller and Kenneth Tobey The film is packed It has science fiction comedy chases really weird situations and really weird characters and it just keeps delivering After the film has already run long it rolls the end credits before its story is even finished Not a great film but good light entertainment it gets a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0106,RoboCop,1987,The Terminator is back and this time he s a good guy In this future the police force is run as a for profit division of Security Concepts Inc and an up and coming young executive thinks he can eliminate crime and get himself a vice presidency with his Robocop project Peter Weller is Alex Murphy a Detroit cop killed in the line of duty who has been recycled by SCI s labs His personality is erased and what is left of him is merged with a cybernetic body to form an unstoppable super cop The cyborg s computer controlled reflexes and enhanced senses and Murphy s 20 years of police experience are combined to form the perfect vehicle to dispassionately uphold the law The Robocop performs flawlessly until Murphy s personality and memory returns One of Robocop s many strengths is Peter Weller s performance in the title role Limited by the cumbersome cyborg costume Weller depends on his voice and later his face to show the transformation from emotionless machine to human being The subtle changes in his speech and movement give life to a character that could have been as flat and two dimensional as the worst comic book hero Another strong point is Murphy s partner Officer Lewis is a tough competent and compassionate cop everything police heroes have always been Her relationship with Murphy helps him reassert his control over the robot and also provides a human counterpoint and some restraint to the violence and shoot outs inherent in this type of movie The atmosphere of ROBOCOP is rich with detail Carefully watching the action in the background gives the viewer a sense of what this world is like It s the same level of throwaway details that made STAR WARS a real looking world Comic relief is added by throwing some pointed darts at SDI toxic waste and network television ROBOCOP gets my vote for best film so far this summer and as one of the top science fiction films in quite awhile
0107,RoboCop,1987,Capsule review Featherweight and violent super hero comic book on film about a cyborg policeman protecting the streets of Detroit Paul Verhoeven is one of the last directors I would expect to make this fun but unoriginal action film The place is Detroit the time is some undefinable date in the future Law enforcement is no longer done by government and is instead contracted out to the giant corporation Omni Consumer Products Two models of mechanized policemen have been developed by OCP One if the ED 209 a kind of walking tank combined with the artificial intelligence to take over standard cop on the beat responsibilities The other model is Robocop a cyborg incorporating human and mechanical parts but requiring a human brain to run the device Just as the ED 209s are about to be mobilized the model proves to have difficulties and instead a recently murdered policeman Murphy played by Peter Buckeroo Banzai Weller is robocized and resurrected as Robocop Three guesses what crime Robocop wants to solve In fact rarely does anyone need more than one guess about anything in ROBOCOP The plot is supremely cliched The resurrected hero idea has been used many times before from the Six Million Dollar Man to Remo Williams to the Lone Ranger The honest police under corrupt leadership plot is done two or three times a year it seems Scenes of hoods shooting at Robocop to no effect are virtual dramatizations of scenes in Superman comics half a century old The only place the script becomes at all creative is in extrapolations of society some inconsistent number of years into the future By the look of cars and clothing styles this film could be taking place tomorrow As far as the technology and changes to society like contracted police protection the film still could be thirty or forty years into the future And some things might not make much sense whenever they take place The ED 209 is nearly useless as a surrogate policeman It is too big and bulky to do anything but travel on flat terrain and blast away Robocop has only a little more finesse If I lived in the Detroit of this film the one thing that would scare me more than crime would be the possibility that Robocop might come to my rescue There is no better way to parlay a 100 robbery into a 100 000 damage repair bill than to call on the Flatfoot of Steel And with what Robocop must cost OCP in police brutality suits they could probably hire an army of old fashioned humans But the biggest surprise about ROBOCOP is that it is directed by Paul Verhoeven This film is an entirely new style for the director of SOLDIER OF ORANGE SPETTERS FLESH AND BLOOD and THE FOURTH MAN Although the latter two films were in spots quite as violent as ROBOCOP all four of Verhoeven s previous films were aimed at a more mature audience ROBOCOP is his first film aimed at the audiences who make floors sticky Where films like THE FOURTH MAN had occasional touches of Kurt Russell ROBOCOP has more of a tendency to fade into KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE One final comment Basil Poledouris who has a nasty habit of giving films better musical scores than they deserve e g BLUE LAGOON CONAN THE BARBARIAN RED DAWN and AMERIKA has once again shown up his director by making his score the best thing in the film Rate this one a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0108,RoboCop,1987,Yo What a summer we re having If you can t find a movie to jazz you this year then you were weaned on a pickle And just when I though 1987 had peaked enter ROBOCOP Remember how STAR WARS combined a lot of things you had seen before into something you d never seen before This is like that in several ways Imagine combining almost every neat science fiction premise in the galaxy with The Six Million Dollar Dirty Buckaroo Terminator Peter Weller also known to his fans as Buckaroo Banzai is perfectly cast in the title role After being brutally shotgunned by a gang of ruthless thugs he is rebuilt as Robocop the cyborg policeman of the future Rob Bottin s design and execution of the Robocop character is as stylish and flawless as the devil he made for LEGEND But Weller must be credited with bringing him to life in a deft performance as the man machine The action is wretched excess The only real mistake with the movie was making the violence so graphic that it requires an R rating It could have been made as a PG 13 so that kids could go I hate to have anybody miss the romping comic book feel and the witty dialogue This is a movie that rises above itself by not taking itself too seriously I love the way it cuts back and forth between the story and television of the future Some of the commercials and news stories are a riot They also form a part of director Paul Verhoeven s convincing and complete vision of a future world dominated by large bumbling corporations Plant your tongue firmly in your cheek fasten your seatbelt and hang on to that tub of popcorn ROBOCOP is going to take you on the ride of the summer
0109,Straight to Hell,1987,In STRAIGHT TO HELL three inept hitmen bankrobbers and their moll spend four days hiding out south of the border Which border is never really clear but they have defiantly crossed into a weird place On the lam in a town run by Irish bandits they drink a lot of coffee beat up a hot dog vendor and spend a lot of time talking about but never actually having sex Alex Cox s spoof captures much of what makes a great spaghetti western Ugly tough men sit in a run down Mexican town and exchange enigmatic dialogue meaningful looks and gun fire oppressed villagers hope for salvation show fighting spirit and die etc But mostly Cox unintentionally shows that the spaghetti westerns were a pointless indulgence in a genre that the director didn t really understand The result is a rambling mish mash that is entertaining as often as it is boring and ultimately ends without ever having gone anywhere Cox recaptures the strangeness that made his earlier film REPOMAN a cult classic but doesn t provide a story to carry the film There is really no reason for any of the actions of any of the characters and that is the downfall of STRAIGHT TO HELL It proves that watching even the strangest antics can be boring if after twenty minutes nothing else happens
0110,Lost Boys The,1987,Capsule review Moody photography and baroque sets constitute most of the value of this punk vampire film about the undead on motorcycles and pre teen Van Helsings The story plays a little fast and loose with traditional vampire lore Back when Hammer Films was making its best vampire films and they were some of the best ever made they used vampirism as a sort of metaphor The early Dracula films with Christopher Lee KISS OF THE VAMPIRE and especially BRIDES OF DRACULA likened vampirism to drug addiction This added a little relevance to the films and it made things easier for the scriptwriter How does a mother behave when she discovers her beloved son has become a vampire Well it s not so hard to find mothers whose sons have become drug addict just have them react the same way In BRIDES OF DRACULA one woman talks about how there is a so called smart set who consider vampirism a sort of special privilege Hammer s metaphor has been resurrected for Joel Schumacher s LOST BOYS The story concerns two boys Sam about 12 years old and Michael about 18 who are the new family in town in Santa Carla California Michael quickly falls in with the wrong sort punk bikers forever getting into trouble Sam makes friends too with boys his own age The bikers are not just punks they are vampires and Sam s friends are vampire hunters From there the plot follows turns which if not completely predictable are hardly surprising either In fact the only real surprise comes from where the scriptwriter suddenly decides to vary from the standard rules of the powers of the vampires With not much of a script to work with Schumacher manages a few pleasant moments of tongue in cheek but little more than that This is however a cinematographer s film and while everyone else seemed to be putting in half hearted efforts the cinematographer was working overtime The photography is moody and at times even eerie The atmospheric camerawork extends even to the gratuitous rock concert scenes If THE LOST BOYS is better than Schumacher s previous films like THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN it is mostly because of emotional effects orchestrated by the cinematographer Rate the film a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0111,Summer School,1987,It s gotten to the point now that when I see a Carl Reiner film advertised I say Aha That s like a Rob Reiner film except that it s not original Both father and son make technically clean movies with good laughs and pleasant people Apparently Rob takes a little more time choosing his scripts which is probably why we see his work a little less frequently If you ve seen the previews trailers for SUMMER SCHOOL you know the plot and have seen the best jokes so you don t have to go If you haven t here s the basic idea Mark Harmon plays the gym teacher who lives for and on the beach on a teacher s salary no less He teaches at Ocean Front High which in the real world would have been turned into condos years ago When the fellow who was supposed to teach summer school in a cameo appearance by the director backs out Harmon is drafted by the evil politically ambitious assistant principal to babysit a class of semi literate misfits through remedial English Of course neither Harmon nor the kids wants to be there so at first he tries to show them and himself a good time But then threatened by the assistant principal and coached by the sultry honors teacher in the next classroom played by Kirstie Alley reprising her Lt Saavik persona he does an about face and tries to whip the kids into shape in time for the test The rest of the movie is a disconnected episodic farce as Harmon gives the kids an incentive to perform he bribes them and helps them become concerned and decent students Sort of Reiner can t decide if he s really serious about this stuff so the plot veers between melodrama social conscience and utter nonsense He even manages to suggest at the end that the kids would have done better if Harmon had sent them to the bathroom for six weeks Harmon himself doesn t disappoint us If you liked his Coors Beer commercials you ll like him in SUMMER SCHOOL He roller skates his way through the film in a good natured way doing his earnest best and funny things happen to him There is no chemistry between him and Alley which is no surprise either You could have replaced either or both with a cardboard cutout labeled Teacher and had the kids carry it around from scene to scene with no difference in effect Still SUMMER SCHOOL is pleasant enough fare for a summer matinee when you d just be hot outside and you re not paying full price If you want to kill some time and they re not asking more than two bucks go for it
0112,La Bamba,1987,By this I mean that it s very difficult for me to really enjoy a movie that contains masterpieces of scary monster makeup things that go bump in the night or sex that is so steamy I start feeling vicariously sore or that acquaints me intimately with things that should have stayed inside human bodies rather than being exposed to the light and heat of the camera I ve had EMT training but gore in movies is quite different from gore in reality It s hard for me to separate out the quality of a movie good direction good acting good script from the emotions it evokes Thus I tend not to go to many movies because I know what to expect and that I won t like it I saw LA BAMBA this Saturday and really loved it It has a certain quality which is best summarized as the triumph of the spirit over all obstacles including death There is a real love between the characters here which is rare in movies today love between brothers love between children and parent love of young people for one another love of music and the sharing between performer and audience It s not rare for me to cry at movies I cried during THE MISSION and HAIR and so help me ROMANCING THE STONE It is rare for me to feel as though there could be a smile behind the tears Despite tragedy LA BAMBA brings me a feeling of hope not least because its message seems to be that music will always be remembered long after the musicians have gone as with all art The only criticism I can make of LA BAMBA is that it is often heavy handed in its foreshadowing of Ritchie Valens s death The movie opens with a plane crash and this theme repeats often Despite this and the heavy handed treatment of the Yaqui charm Ritchie wears it was possible to forget at times that tragedy was coming In particular the performances of Esai Morales as Ritchie s brother and Lou Diamond Phillips as Ritchie himself were very convincing The performance scenes were very well done in the style of the period I ve learned to expect very good things from Luis Valdez and this is no exception
0113,RoboCop,1987,Let us cross pens Mark and I have a number of long running debates including one on the value of movies like DREAMSCAPE TERMINATOR and ROBOCOP and another on the adaptability of super hero comics to film If I may be somewhat cavalier Mark tends to feel these films are unexceptional while I feel they serve the special purpose of bringing standard SF ideas to a movie audience generally unfamiliar with them On the other topic Mark tends to argue that super heros make poor or at least silly films that are not good SF or anything else As a long time fan of the super hero genre especially Marvel s merry mutants I of course disagree At least I feel the super hero genre could be made into excellent films if only Hollywood tried At long last in ROBOCOP we may have such a film Although flawed it s a pretty good action picture better than BLUE THUNDER or WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE It has a nice score by the gentleman who scored Conan the Barbarian really another successful super hero adaptation It has lots of good lines and funny jokes including My name is Murphy You re going to be one bad m er f ker and You re fired It is 100 better than the scientifically silly RUNAWAY wherein Tom Selleck battles robots Like TERMINATOR which along with BACK TO THE FUTURE introduced recursive time travel stories to the modern audience on a sensible level ROBOCOP shows us a lot of wonderful stuff we ve read a hundred times but never seen before The plot is old stuff but who cares Heinlein claimed there were only three basic plots anyway boy meets girl the little tailor and boy becomes man For those who care ROBOCOP combines elements from all three of Heinlein s basic plots Mercifully the makers of ROBOCOP take their premise seriously and spares us cackling villains and silly sidekicks This is a clean mean story that owes a lot to the THE ROAD WARRIOR s realistic violence and BRAINSTORM s greedy militarized hi tech corporations Mark complains a good deal about the inconsistencies in this future world I think he s holding to an excessively high standard ROBOCOP is not BLADE RUNNER but its future a few Merlin phones aside is far more completely thought out than the average SF movie It is not up to written SF standards but I suspect the producers wanted to make a few bucks and couldn t afford to re do everything It suspended my disbelief far better than 2010 ODYSSEY TWO which by contrast except for the spaceships seemed to be taking place in the next five years The makers of ROBOCOP have at least made a serious and sometimes not so serious attempt to project current trends out 20 30 years The plot has several weakness that tend to make it easier for ROBOCOP to bring in the bad guys In particular at one point the main henchman makes a speech to Robocop admitting that he works for the main villain This makes things easy for Robocop but 1 the henchman is getting thrown through windows and such like 2 it is clearly established in the film that the henchman might suppose mentioning his boss s name would save him At another point a bad guy puts down a perfectly good armor piercing cannon to use a crane to drop a lot of metal parts on Robocop This is stupid but at least the movie has the main bad guy yelling at him to Stop messing around and shoot Mark also complains that the ED 209 a robot that the cyborg Robocop edges out of a job would not be very effective as a policeman which is amply demonstrated in the movie but it is also made clear in the film that the corporation doesn t care if it actually works as a cop their plan is to sell it to the Pentagon I have a beef that I m surprised Mark missed Cops are being killed right and left The crooks are armed like they just came out of the National Guard Armory The cops well the cops carry what appear to be 9mm pea shooters with nary a shotgun or automatic rifle in sight Maybe these are supposed to be some kind of advanced handguns but if I were on that future Detriot police force I d carry an AK 47 or a Uzi Overall though these are just quibbles ROBOCOP is more realistic than many action movies including most James Bonds and REMO WILLIAMS The plot is not as tightly wound as that of THE CONVERSATION but it exceeds BLUE THUNDER by a wide margin To this it must be added that ROBOCOP continues the line of action heroines started by ALIEN and ALIENS We see for the very first time without any special attention that sexual equality has reached the point that male and female cops share the same locker room There is no gratuitous flesh and the heroine is not model pretty However she has a mean crescent kick ROBOCOP straddles the edge between a realistic super hero comic and SF If one guy is a cyborg or wears a powered suit a la the comic hero Iron Man we tend to have a super hero story If everyone has a powered suit we have Heinlein s STARSHIP TROOPERS It is clearly implied in the movie that fairly soon there are going to be other cyborg cops marking the beginning of the transition to a still more fantastic future ROBOCOP also marks a new level in audience acceptance of technology and human transformation and may well point the way toward our own cyber punk future Murphy as Robocop eventually overcomes his programming and recovers his sense of self Once having done so he accepts his new role as a cyborg cop realizing that his previous life is over Although technology not under human control is dangerous Star Wars lasers burn 10 000 acres in California the amuck ED 209 etc technology backed by human integrity is working for the betterment of all I was amazed at how favorable the audience seemed as the movie ended In some non trivial sense we are all Murphy We went to sleep and a lot of technology insinuated itself into our lives Now as before it is up to us to use it for good or ill Each time we wake however there is still more technology and like Murphy we know there is no going back Who knows Mark If you get very very lucky someday you may wake to see the planets forming around that star you want to visit But if you do you will find that like Murphy you have said more good bys than it is healthy to contemplate Rating on the 4 to 4 scale 2 Keep in mind that Robocop is rated R for a reason this is not a kiddie movie
0114,Fly The,1986,THE FLY has been considered one of the great science fiction horror films for many years Perhaps millions of children have frightened younger brothers and sisters with falsetto cries of Help me Please Help me It was a natural for a remake and in 1984 Brooksfilm bought a screen adaptation by Charles Edward Pogue who also scripted PSYCHO III and Walon green David Cronenberg was given the screenplay to film he kept some rewrote a lot more and filmed the result On a visit to a cinema shop in Manhattan I discovered that copies of the Pogue Green screenplay were available As a fan of the original film with screenplay by James Clavell who went on to script films like TO SIR WITH LOVE and THE SATAN BUG and then to write novels like SHOGUN and TAI PAN and to a lesser extent as a fan of the remake with screenplay credited to Pogue and Cronenberg the temptation was too great to pass up Geoffrey Powell is a research scientist just below Nobel Prize caliber he works for a high tech research and development company Loften Industries headquartered in new York City Loften however has grown tired of waiting for Geoffrey s researches into particle transmission to bear some sort of useful fruit He is ready to replace Geoffrey if the young researcher does not produce Geoff is able to transmit objects sometimes successfully like STAR TREK as a friend observes but often not so successfully He usually transmits souvenir Statues of Liberty A poor touch here is that one appears to be successfully transmitted until Geoff s wife Katie notices the wording has been reversed If the wording were reversed the whole statue should have been noticeably reversed Under pressure from Loften Geoff transmits himself but the audience knows that a fly transmitted at the same time has disappeared Now the story is similar to Cronenberg s film Geoff at first seems much improved by the transmission finding himself a much faster jogger and able to lift greater weights He starts transforming soon growing new hair on his body losing his fingernails He does not however climb the walls at least literally the way Cronenberg has him do But then neither does he philosophize about his condition either and we can credit Cronenberg for the strange thought processes that were the high points of the film There is no discussion of how a matter transmitter turned in a gene splicer a rather absurd concept from the film Instead the two organisms were fused into one and we are told A fly is a very primitive form of life That s why it s so successful Its cells are stronger they are able to multiply more rapidly than Geoff s own in mutation the more primitive structure is always the victor In the end and out of control Geoff murders a neighbor and his villainous boss using vomit drops full of burning enzymes much as in the film An attempt at suicide in his matter transmitter turns him into a six foot fly and finally he is killed by a laser gone wild Apparently Pogue thinks that a laser will flail around like a fire hose if not bolted down The final scene has his wife Katie giving birth to a giant maggot only to realize it was a momentary hallucination or was it If you can turn a blind eye to some of the scientific blunders Pogue s script is often more credible than is Cronenberg s rewrite The funding for Brundle research never made any sense in the film and Pogue has a much better feel for how research gets gone in the R D community and under what kind of pressures it is done Neither script will win any prizes for scientific accuracy Neither script is clearly better Overall I would say that the Cronenberg script while less believable is the better for having shown us a little more of the mental processes of a creature part man and part fly I would still contend that of the three stories the original film was the best and at the same time the most accurate to George Langlaan s story
0115,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,1987,I really shouldn t be surprised in fact I should have avoided this on principle but I really enjoyed SUPERMAN and thought SUPERMAN II was adequate and seeing Gene Hackman s name on the roster and David and Leslie Newman s names off it gave me some hope that we might have something up to SUPERMAN II something corny but with enough grit to keep my attention Instead we have BATTLE OF THE FLYING WRESTLERS Others in rec arts movies have listed the stupidities in this film while I don t expect Superman movies in fact I don t expect any movies to be a lesson in Natural Laws and How They Work this film shrugs off absurdities like a rhino with a valium habit And as stated elsewhere the special effects which have never been a strong point with these films has sunk to bargain basement levels I m suprised we didn t see any spaceships with sparklers attached to the rear Most disappointing though is that Supes is played as something of an assh le The only feature that has any appeal in this thing is Margot Kidder as Lois Lane many of her scenes with Clark have some real charm However Superman spends his time either trying to avoid her especially the ridiculous how can Clark and Superman be in the same room at the same time scene which is so old and stale that it seems to crawl out onto the screen and die or he uses the amnesia kiss displayed at the end of SUPERMAN II boy what those yellow sun rays will do to a Kryptonian male to erase her memory after each revelation that Clark is Superman This must leave Lois with an unconsicous resembling a Unix tm core dump and it makes you wonder what kind of a relationship Ol Supes feels he can have with a woman he s in love with Really not a shred of interest even to comics completists Go see ROBOCOP instead it s worth the viewing but it could have been just as good or better with only half the violence Ick melting people
0116,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,1987,I just got back from seeing the new SUPERMAN IV THE QUEST FOR PEACE What a joke The theatre was anything but peaceful everyone kept laughing at the unreal circumstances Mr man kept getting into and out of As you ll notice in the opening credits in the end ones too if you re not in too much of a hurry to get out before anyone recognizes you Reeve himself co wrote this epic Well it takes guts to write a terrible script and then to act it out He even had the classic superhero speeches such as his the subway is still a safe place for people The movie did however have the usual moments of good humor much like the other movies Clark reveals his true powers briefly and by accident at some good points And his role reversal trying to be both Superman and Kent I thought was pretty humorous too There were even parts of the plot I could say were pleasingly surprising such as Superman s turning old and the coincidental retrieval and even existence of Krypton s last power the power module of Kent s spaceship sure was lucky he got it when he did eh In general Chistopher Reeve I believe is bucking to get out of the Superman business I do not think there will be much of an audience for another one The movie was either very child oriented or the producers have a hard time seeing us viewers as anything more than children
0117,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,1987,This has got to be the worst movie I ve blown five bucks on in a very long time Parts of it were however so bad that they were funny Look up in the sky it s a bird it s a plane it s a statue By the way after irrelevant scene 1 superman saving Soviet spacecraft when he hit the baseball in irrelevant scene 2 did anyone else think it was going to hit the spacecraft Look out Ivan here we go again All in all S man had a lousy week used up his dad s green thing violated the prime directive non interference and had nothing to show for it But seriously why was the subplot about the Daily Planet takeover in the movie to make it 2 hours long Why was Mariel Hemingway in the movie to be a damsel in distress for 18 seconds Chris Reeve did a really lousy job writing this Why don t they get comic book writers to write comic book movies
0118,Living Daylights The,1987,After the last Bond flick I thought that 007 was dead The plot had become metastasized with silliness and Roger Moore was beginning to creak The rumors about Pierce Brosnan confirmed that the movies were about to descend into terminal foppishness The long running series of James Bond adventures were going out with a whimper I m happy to report that they are back with a bang Timothy Dalton in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is the best Bond in years The proportion of intrigue to action and gadgetry to romance has been restored to proper order For the first time in ages we have a Bond who is about the right age and who is willing to get his hands dirty The scope of this movie and the amazing action sequences are in the same league as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK It had to have helped that they used an Ian Fleming short story as the foundation because the plot has as many twists as the mountain road in the opening gag And even though I never bought her for an instant as a cellist Maryam d Abo the latest Bond Girl has to get credit for some of the best scenery in the movie She makes a beautiful and innocent foil for Dalton s patient competent and yet fallible Bond THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is certainly worth the 5 50 I paid to see it and I suspect that the capacity crowd with me opening night felt the same Gosh this has been a fun summer
0119,Living Daylights The,1987,Well yes I enjoyed THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS not just parts of it but the entire film straight through The Friday night audience I was in laughed uproariously several times and seemed to come out with pretty pleased expressions on their collective faces However for those of you who are reading the local movie reviews heralding a new beginning for the James Bond series not quite Below are spoilers First Bond himself Let s face it the character created by Ian Fleming was something of a psycho he wore Freudian hang ups on his sleeve Distrust of women domination the whole bit When Sean Connery took over the role in the first three films he played Bond with something of the brutal edge that Fleming described but this was The Movies after all and the suave killer soon disappeared underneath heroics puns and gadgets albeit stylishly done Then for reasons that still amazes me someone decided to hire Roger Moore to take over the role For LIVE AND LET DIE he played Bond as The Saint afterwards he became James Bond Her Majesty s Comic Relief with a Poker Up His Ass Except for one exception THE SPY WHO LOVED ME the role disappeared underneath greater and greater stunts and special effects and under the increasingly wooden performances by Moore Timothy Dalton could play James Bond like Bob Hoskins after Moore and still be refreshing Instead he tries something else with Bond a professional but without the hang ups and without his tongue anywhere near his cheek He looks earnest and though it s Business First he also has the Sir Galahad urges firmly supporting everything he does one supposes M allows it because of his excellent track record Still he gets thrown into a lot of the situations Moore has for the last several movies John Glen directs this film as per usual it just seems more suspenseful because he s not Acting Concerned he actually looks like he s worried how he s going to survive He even makes mistakes Dalton also tends to be less aloof scenes with other British agents Q is back though without the stock nagging he usually performs give you the feeling he actually works with them the new Moneypenny is quite good In fact it s nice to see some competent agents other than Bond a battle between a safe house guard and a Russian assassin makes you wonder for a while who will get the upper hand It also makes the villain seem much more capable and dangerous when he confronts Bond The rest of the film though has the trappings of recent Bond pictures supposedly erotic credits they now have Marketing Director near the beginning of the line stunts gadgets humor a new Felix Leiter collect them all and pretty fantastic luck on Bond s part They ve even gone so far as to try to keep a sort of continuity going General Gogol who has been depicted as the head of the KGB in four or five previous films has been moved to the Soviet foreign office it would appear that John Rhys Davies will be take up the role of head of the KGB Well more power to them if they can keep the next few movies at this pitch and with this quality of the dialogue and the plot they have paid attention to the details here I ll continue to watch them However take it with a grain of salt the films introducing a new Bond have usually put a lot of extra effort into supporting factors Whether they do so for the next film is a good question Other comments Joe Don Baker is listed fairly high up on the credits but he can t be on screen for more than 5 minutes during the entire film The villains seem a bit more stupid than sinister though the fellow playing the Russian defector works well 1 I read in one of the trash magazines they pass out free in the theater that the Czech cellist Bond woos in this film is planned to be a steady love interest in later films not an unattractive alternative as the actress who plays Kara adds a certain Indiana Jones humor to the situations Bond finds himself in Can anyone confirm or deny this I can t believe they d put anything in the films to deny Bond s availability in later films but I would like to see it as it makes his romances each film seem pretty superficial 2 The Aurora theater shut the projection off before they got to the very end of the credits did they have a James Bond will return in XXXXXXXX message at the tail end They did have James Bond will return but no film title was given ecl
0120,Living Daylights The,1987,Pretty close to a quarter of a century ago the first James Bond film blazed at times literally across the screen It presented a lithe young Bond played of course by Sean Connery It was popular so a second one was made to give the audiences more As each successive film was a smash the producers kept trying to give the audiences the same only more the same actors bigger more powerful and more fanciful villains with bigger plans and more bizarre henchmen There were however problems with this approach The actors eventually got too old for their roles Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny went from being sexy to matronly Audiences did not seem to like George Lazenby so when Connery finally left the series they replaced him with an already popular Roger Moore two years older than Connery Moore started out almost too old to play Bond and the succeeding years made matters worse On top of that Moore was never right to play Bond Ian Flemings s superspy is a thug who when the occasion called for it had nice manners Moore was a fop who when the occasion called for it could dirty his hands He simply did not work in the part It was clear that the series was in trouble when he took the role in LIVE AND LET DIE It had one of the weakest Bond plots Also perhaps in retaliation for a nasty comment Bond makes about the Beatles in GOLDFINGER Paul McCartney wrote one of the worst of the Bond title songs It had the dubious distinction of having duplicate redundant words in one of its lines IN this ever changing world IN which we live IN Meanwhile the ever escalating villains started going in for total world destruction with henchmen that became impossible to kill By MOONRAKER the series had become a silly comic book that was turning audiences off Something had to be done It was FOR YOUR EYES ONLY started as silly as any Bond film but after the first third it straightened out and had a very plausible villain OCTOPUSSY too had a reasonable Cold War plot The last Moore film A VIEW TO A KILL tried to capture some of the spirit of the more successful Bond films apparently reframing the plot of GOLDFINGER The number of parallels are too great to be coincidence The film was not the complete mess it is usually considered to be by Bond fans but it was well below average for the series The series has long been in need of an overhaul and with the choice of a new Bond we also got a new M a new Moneypenny and a new feel with a younger and more vital Bond Through an unrecognized stroke of luck for the producers Pierce Brosnan the first choice for Bond was unavailable Brosnan would have been another Bond in the Moore tradition too handsome and insufficiently thug like Dalton has a hard flinty look rather than being pretty As such he looks the part of Bond the most of any Bond in the series Other characters of interest include John Rhys Davies as a perenniel friendly foe Pushkin Pushkin is played with some fun by Rhys Davies veteran of SHOGUN RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and VICTOR VICTORIA Until now the foe has been General Gogol who shows up for only one quick shot at the end of this outing but his background has been given to Pushkin and Rhys Davies will probably be the continuing character from this point on Bond s new girl is Kara Milovy played by Maryam d Abo who looks like a stretched version of Rosanna Arquette She is a little less ditzy than most of the Bond women though well below the standard set by Carole Bouquet as Melina in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY One wonders how the public would react if there wasn t a love interest ready to drop into bed with Bond in just one of the films The plot of THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is more complex than previous Bond films The long dead organization that Fleming used to call SMERSH has apparently been revived and in the midst of attempts to bring detente between the British and the Soviets suddenly SMERSH is murdering double O agents Why It has something to do with a defecting Soviet dignitary an American arms dealer and obscure goings on in Czechoslovakia Tangiers and Afghanistan Oh there are some of those irritating plugs for products including a winery and an electronics firm to whom I will not give more publicity by naming here And the producers have not entirely abandoned the silliness of the Moore Bond films There are a few silly weapons one more to use in a car chase and one silly ski chase using a non standard toboggan but for the most part they have been able to keep their tongues out of their cheeks Which is a quaint way of saying that this is the Bond film the fans have been waiting for a very long time THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS may be the best Bond film since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale My ranking of the Broccoli produced films best to worst and subject to some change is
0121,Stakeout,1987,There are all kinds of police films coming out this year The more notable among them are THE UNTOUCHABLES BEVERLY HILLS COPS II LETHAL WEAPON and DRAGNET The newest addition to the list is John Badham s STAKEOUT STAKEOUT is unlikely to earn at the boxoffice anything like those four films yet of the four only THE UNTOUCHABLES may be a better film To begin with STAKEOUT is about three dimensional characters THE UNTOUCHABLES had at least an interesting character in Elliot Ness They go downhill from there to DRAGNET whose main character is not so much a character as a voice impression over a smirk masquerading as a character Which had believable situations None of the four really but STAKEOUT does There are perhaps other virtues that makes THE UNTOUCHABLES a better film in general but as a police film STAKEOUT is probably the best thing we have seen since some of the better films based on Joseph Wambaugh s novels And with so many police films coming out that is saying quite a bit Chris Leece played by Richard Dreyfus and Bill Reimers played by Emilio Estevez are the kind of cops you rarely see a film about They are neither supercops nor complete screw ups They are just average men trying to do a job They pull an assignment that no cop really wants to get a dull stakeout spending nights watching the house of the former girlfriend of a sociopath who has recently escaped from prison It s a dull stupid job just watching a house so they keep themselves occupied by joking with each other and fighting a practical joke war with the two cops on the day shift None of the humor is forced or unrealistic and it comes from the personalities of the characters rather than being forced into the plot Complications set in as Leece gets closer to the girlfriend than police rules allow and eventually finds himself falling in love with her John Badham is an unpredictable director Some of his films work as well as the clever TV movie ISN T IT SHOCKING SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY He can also turn out tripe like WARGAMES and BLUE THUNDER The latter is a police film whose weakest points are just where STAKEOUT is strongest its credibility and its human characters STAKEOUT throws in a little more action than it needs but if you like the genre of police films this is the one to see Give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0122,Adventures in Babysitting,1987,Back in the 50s and 60s society seemed safe and simple With the exception of a few crime and juvenile delinquent films it seemed that if you simply behaved yourself you would lead a calm and placid existence As we perceive society getting weirder we see more films of people doing normal things that wind them up in the middle of real chaos particularly over a single night In INTO THE NIGHT a man who is simply at the wrong airport parking slot at the wrong moment finds not only his night but his whole life turned inside out as a result Well that s not too different from NORTH BY NORTHWEST after the main character runs across the wrong people in this case criminals The classic night of pure chaos film is AFTER HOURS There aren t even dangerous criminals in AFTER HOURS it is mostly paranoia and just the general weirdness of people that creates all the danger Well of late Hollywood has been doing films in all kinds of popular sub genres but with teen age main characters instead of the usual adults The newest night of chaos film has three teenagers and an adolescent going through a night of chaos in Chicago Chris Parker played by Elisabeth Shue who was also in THE KARATE KID is baby sitting for Sara played by Maia Brewton when a friend who desperately needs a ride calls her Against her better judgement she packs Sara Sara s older brother Brad played by Keith Coogan formerly of THE WALTONS and his friend Daryl Coopersmith played by Anthony Rapp into her mother s station wagon and heads for the city Add one flat tire and one weirdo with a tow truck and the film is off and running What follows is a lot of fun and adventures nowhere nearly as puerile as the regrettable title might indicate This film is the directorial debut of Chris Columbus who wrote the screenplays for three Steven Spielberg produced films GREMLINS THE GOONIES and YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Columbus gets his young cast to act and turns out a fluff film but good fluff Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0124,Living Daylights The,1987,The bi annual Bond film has appeared again and thankfully it s a great improvement on the last few THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is the best Bond film since FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and before that one would have to go all the way back to the Sean Connery films to find its equal Albert Broccoli and John Glen have revitalized the Bond formula by refusing to continue the game of self one upsmanship that had reduced the series to near farce Instead they have returned to the strengths of the first few films semi believable plots reliance on Bond rather than on special effects and a serious tone lightened by occasional humor rather than self parody occasionally flirting with reality The major reason for this return to the old ways is the new James Bond Timothy Dalton Dalton is probably closer to the Bond created by Ian Fleming than any of his predecessors He not only makes the action believable which Roger Moore rarely did and projects the debonair attitude that is so vital to the Bond mystique but he also manages to show some of the tension underneath Roger Moore s went through some of the most hideous ordeals without ever showing any sign that he was deeply affected by them Perhaps a slight expression of concern when the going got particularly rough and a minute suggestion of relief when he escaped an unusually fiendish trap but after that the experience was completely behind him and as good as forgotten Moore s Bond had no more history than the typical figure in a video arcade game and rather less than some of those Dalton on the other hand shows that being an undercover agent isn t all a bed of roses His is the first on screen Bond who gives any hint that the character could flirt on the edge of a nervous breakdown Not to say that he doesn t show suitable aplomb in the face of danger but you can t help but feel that it all does mean something to him and isn t just a game that he knows he s destined to win The newly serious character is backed by a much more plausible plot than is typically used in a Bond film For the first time in quite a while one might actually have the film spoiled by hearing too much about the plot Suffice it to say that it borders on the credible and is not nearly as cataclysmic as A VIEW TO A KILL or THE SPY WHO LOVED ME Richard Maibaum whose association with Bond films goes all the way back to DR NO and Michael G Wilson who wrote the script provide Bond with a nice selection of witty lines and neat gadgets again not as broad as in the recent films Bond jokes when it s appropriate but the jokes fit within the story One joke is even thrown away going almost unnoticed by the audience thereby making the point that we are watching James Bond relieving the tension with a quip rather than Timothy Dalton straining for a few cheap yocks Director John Glen started off as a second unit director specializing in action sequences before graduating to the full directing duties Glen has directed all of the Bond films since FOR YOUR EYES ONLY not counting NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN of course He s done a particularly good job with THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS especially with the action sequences Glen seems to have been inspired here more by the Indiana Jones school of stunt and action work than by the previous Bond films He tends to have the danger and intensity build trying hard to give a sense of true risk rather than merely dazzle us with the technical brilliance of a stunt The opening sequence keynotes this change instead of something like a plane flying vertically through a closing hanger door or having Bond parachute off a glacier THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS opens with a sequence relying primarily on that oldest of action settings a car chase Skillful editing and direction make it far more exciting than the earlier stunts which tended to provoke applause rather than tension Glen and company follow through with this approach throughout As has been the tendency in the last few Bond films a fair number of well known actors show up in supporting roles John Rhys Davies appears as a Russian general Joe Don Baker has an unexpectedly small role as an arms dealer and Art Malik finally shows up as an Afghan rebel All do what is expected of them without any flashes of brilliance Jeroen Krabbe as another Russian general does perhaps a little too much of what is expected of him Maryam d Abo joins the list of unknown actresses who have played female leads in Bond films She s beautiful and responds well to menace but doesn t seem likely to have a brilliant future Several of the usual supporting players show up doing what they usually do The technical work on THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is a demonstration of state of the craft rather than state of the art All areas demonstrate a high degree of professionalism without ever moving beyond into innovation Maurice Binder s credits are a particularly weak effort by him and the title song is one of the worst ever written for a Bond film The rest of the John Barry score is a serviceable one but breaks no new ground THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS should appeal strongly to those who have spent years yearning for the Bond of yore People who actually liked Roger Moore s Bond and there must be a lot of them considering how much money his films made will probably be disappointed that THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS isn t that sort of film at all It is a bit long and would probably have played better ten minutes shorter and Dalton doesn t seem to have completely settled into the role On the whole though THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is an encouraging addition to the Bond series
0126,Angelic Conversation The,1985,Music by Ennio Morricone This was supposed banned somewhere for many years This early Algerian production is a gritty drama about the liberation of Algiers from the French It s a fairly straightforward political thriller and it s hard to tell why it was banned perhaps for political reasons The only objectionable scenes are one or two depicting the torture of Algerian revolutionaries Directed by Derek Jarman with music by Coil At this stage way before Caravaggio Jarman seems to be more interested in the interplay of light color and sound than in creating any type of narrative structure His human figures move through abstract and treated real landscapes but their movement is usually clipped as if seen through strobe lights Some interesting light color textures reminiscent of Brakhage but on the whole I found this to be much less interesting than Caravaggio If this is representative of the Taiwan New Wave than the movement still needs at least a few years to mature There are some definite breaks with the traditional Taiwanese melodrama but old values both cinematic and philosophical still retain a stranglehold This realist depiction of rural farm life and harsh economic realities is smothered by stock characters and situations and cloying sentimentality
0127,Back to the Beach,1987,Aren t we the corniest couple you ever saw asks Annette Funicello at the end of BACK TO THE BEACH And the answer is a resounding yes BACK TO THE BEACH is actually a parody of all of the beach movies of the early 60s Annette made with teen age heartthrob Frankie Avalon combining different elements of the seven movies made There s the obligatory big bonfire party a pajama party good people bad people on the beach updated for the 80s audience bikini shots galore along with the muscle types one always sees at the beach at least in California and of course surfing The plot is minimally simplistic just like its predecessors Without giving too much away suffice it to say that Mom Dad Annette and Frankie now live in midwestern Ohio and desperatley need a vacation Hawaii is the place but with a small stopover in Los Angeles to see their daughter What happens once they arrive in Los Angeles is sheer lunacy Nostalgia reeks over them once they arrive at the beach where they once hung out as teenagers for Annette immediately Frankie takes a little longer Mom and Dad have a little spat and are separated briefly But just like the old films every thing is just hunky dory by the end of the film even with no winners and no losers to borrow a line from the film The movie is non stop corn from beginning to end It pokes fun at the simplistic morals of the originals without sounding too preachy It also pokes fun at all the hawking Annette did for various products on TV concentrating on peanut butter probably what she is most famous for Annette does not mind poking fun at the old naive innocent image she projected in the old movies wondering aloud if just once I d like to play the bad girl but immediately reminded that was impossible But the movie does play loosely with people s memory of the originals Annette and Frankie are the only original cast members from the originals although the movie would have us believe there are more Connie Stevens plays a minor role here that keeps reminding us that she must have been in the originals although she was never in any of the beach movies with Annette and Frankie side note by me Didn t she star in the original Where The Boys Are back in the early 60s No that was Connie Francis ecl There are cameos by stars of late 50s early 60s TV shows that for the most part work remarkably well along with various in jokes about the series they played in The one that works best is Bob Denver Gilligan in GILLIGAN S ISLAND lamenting the fact that he was so smart he could take a pineapple or was it a coconut and some string and he d have a nuclear reactor but could he fix a two foot hole in the boat And when Don Adams Maxwell Smart of GET SMART did his Would you believe bit I was rolling in the aisles However there are problems with the movie and some things just didn t seem to fit into the feel of the movie Pee Wee Herman makes an appearance as himself in the movie that for me just didn t fit in with the feeling of the movie Also it was painfully obvious that it took quite a few days to film some of the beach scenes as the weather went from bright sunlight to overcast back to bright sunlight in the same scene Finally if I see another Siskel Ebert impression I ll scream using Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers from LEAVE IT TO BEAVER one of the few cameos by stars that didn t work All in all though BACK TO THE BEACH is a fun and enjoyable film you should see if you re tired as I am of all the violence lousy sci fi films that seem to take over during the summer months One word of warning though leave the little kids at home for this one I saw the movie at a 5 00 PM matinee that consisted mostly of young couples with young children 5 7 years old and the kids were getting a little restless during the movie
0128,Back to the Beach,1987,Twenty five to twenty years ago American International Pictures had targeted a teen age audience and was churning out cheap films for a ready market Their main staples were quickly thrown together horror films and their Beach Party series That series included BEACH PARTY 1963 MUSCLE BEACH PARTY 1964 BIKINI BEACH 1964 PAJAMA PARTY 1964 BEACH BLANKET BINGO 1965 HOW TO STUFF A WILD BIKINI 1965 and GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI 1966 Annette Funicello starred in the first six and Frankie Avalon in the first five Only Harvey Lembeck as Eric Von Zipper was in all seven Inspired perhaps by the trend to take 50s and 60s TV programs and do 80s sequels Paramount is this year telling the story of what happened after Annette and Frankie grew up and got married They are a generation older and returning to the haunts of their youth Today Annette is a perky peanut butter pusher and Frankie owns a Ford dealership in Ohio They take their would be punk son to visit their daughter on the old beach in California Their daughter played by Lori Loughlin who seems to be the only one in the film who knows how to act is shacking up with a fiance about whom she has not told her parents and Frankie reacts just like any of the fathers in the old series Also along for the ride is Connie Stevens as Annette s bad girl rival in the earlier films This is something of a trick on the audience of course Connie Stevens never appeared in the original series BACK TO THE BEACH is enjoyable for about half an hour Then the premise starts wearing thin and the comedy gets very uneven The producers have assembled a dozen or so TV characters from the 50s and 60s plus a somewhat out of place Pee Wee Herman The best line of the film delivered by an aging Bob Denver is a wry comment on the logic of GILLIGAN S ISLAND On the whole BACK TO THE BEACH is better than might have been expected but it is still only a high 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0129,Whos That Girl?,1987,Imagine this premise a vaguely owlish junior member of New York society is due to be married to a spoiled stupid socialite By accident he is saddled with a strange and impulsive woman who gets him in a lot of trouble with his stuffy associates There is a large member of the leopard family involved over whom the strange woman has a certain measure of authority The story ends as we would expect with the triumph of true love What you say it s been done How about this one a New York yuppie is virtually kidnapped by an oddly dressed and sexy female petty criminal and taken not entirely against his will on a set of adventures in a strange and violent world Shucks are you kidding Ok this one s got to be original This real white collar type guy gets involved for an evening with a ditzy female who gets him in a lot of trouble with his boss takes him into a neighborhood where his car gets trashed and generally lands him in a real mess In spite of his anger at her they really love each other and love triumphs at a comic society wedding held out on a lawn behind a big house What I m sorry I can t think of any more and neither could the the writers of WHO S THAT GIRL the new comedy starring Madonna and Griffin Dunne reprising his I Hate NY experiences from AFTER HOURS Dunne turns in a somewhat inconsistent performance although that may be more the script s fault than his own He can t figure out if he likes the woman Nicky Finn or hates her and if he s scared or having a good time This is of course what he is supposed to be feeling but the changes in character are so radical and so telegraphed as to be unbelievable George Will once wrote about John Wayne that Wayne didn t act he simply played Wayne Similarly Madonna has a perfectly serviceable screen persona that is based on playing Madonna This is not the same as acting but that never hurt John Wayne either The danger is that Hollywood will be tempted to build empty movies around her persona WHO S THAT GIRL treads dangerously close as the lack of care taken with Dunne s character suggests The filmmakers rely on Madonna to anchor a cast of empty and stereotyped supporting characters worlds away from the gritty and convincing misfits inhabiting a film like SOMETHING WILD or even better DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN That said WHO S THAT GIRL offers some good laughs What the writers lack in originality and consistency they make up in cleverness There are some great gags in this film and some lines that with any luck will be remembered longer than the movie itself The jokes are good enough to almost make you forget how bad the script really is Almost WHO S THAT GIRL gets the Dan Frank Matinee rating which means see it on the cheap if you have some time to kill it s hot and the theatre has air conditioning By the way there appears to be a cameo appearance by Spike Lee as a bicycle messenger who comes to pick up the cat I forgot and didn t look in the credits Can someone confirm this Lee is of course the very talented actor and director of SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT Too bad they didn t let him make this one
0130,Nadine,1987,When we go to the movies we generally resign ourselves to enjoying the films in spite of their imperfections We say I enjoyed this light comedy even though it was totally shallow and predictable or This was a fun excursion into empty minded comic book style violence or something of that sort It s rare to walk out of a movie and not think that somehow it could have been better NADINE provides such a rare experience It stars Kim Basinger and Jeff Bridges as an almost divorced husband and wife who get mixed up by accident in the schemes of a particularly nasty wrestling promoter played with a wonderful mix of debonair sliminess and bewilderment by Rip Torn Torn was the best feature of EXTREME PREJUDICE and his departure early in that picture was lamented by many critics He eats up the screen whenever he s on and only the presence of Bridges keeps him from completely dominating this film I complained in a recent posting about movies that mangle their settings acting as if the only unique thing about say Chicago is its name Movies like ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING are made by people who have no sense of the unique contribution a locale can make above and beyond mere script to their mood and tone NADINE is set and mostly filmed in Austin Texas which I ve had the pleasure of making my temporary home this summer Since the action takes place in 1954 the filmmakers fiftyized several Austin locations of the proper vintage to be used for the exterior shots When the characters are supposed to be on Sixth Street by God they really ARE on Sixth Street the day we saw the film we happened down there and the block they used at Sixth and Brazos is almost identical to its appearance in the movie There is simply no substitute for authenticity Chicago has it and Texas has it and NADINE has it in large measure both in its settings and its characterizations I wasn t alive in 1954 so I can t compare it to my memories but I walked out of NADINE feeling That s the way it was It s a sort of honky tonk MY FAVORITE YEAR same year in fact I m not going to talk about the plot except to say that NADINE is a comedy adventure with a perfectly plausible premise and that you ll enjoy the heck out of it You can pay real money for this one folks
0131,Vampiros en La Habana,1985,Capsule review The watchable Cuban feature cartoon was made for the international market It is pure fluff with no more political comment than MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT which it occasionally resembles After a short history of vampirism and the discovery of a drug to protect vampires from the sunlight that irritates their skin and reduces them to a pile of ashes the scene is Havana in 1933 Professor Von Dracula and his nephew Joseph Amadeus have become the focus of a war between a Chicago based gang of vampires and another gang from Dusseldorf One gang wants to control the Vampisol drug the other wants to open beaches protected from the sun and will be put out of business if Vampisol protects vampires from sunlight VAMPIRES EN HABANA VAMPIRES IN HAVANA is a 80 minute cartoon from Cuba that lampoons vampire movies gangster movies Cuban entertainment James Bond films Cuban history and anything else within reach In many ways it resembles Japan s Lupin III cartoons with a little more humor and a little less logic to the action In it we discover that vampirism is a wide spread sub culture with its own radio stations its own version of the Mafia the Capa Nostra its own mad scientists and its own set of problems There are many kinds of vampire one always appears in a bubble like Glinda the Good Witch but Joseph Amadeus is a new kind Thanks to a monthly quaff of Vampisol he has so few symptoms of vampirism that he has grown up never knowing that he is a vampire The pace of VAMPIRES EN HABANA is breakneck but the animation is rather poor The artwork is unexceptional and includes racial stereotypes that we reactionary capitalist lackeys would never dare to put into a film It is enjoyable but not very deep Writer director Juan Padron makes his film almost devoid of political comment or any other kind of comment Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0132,Cant Buy Me Love,1987,Do you harbor secret reservations about the quality of John Hughes s films Granted his record is pretty good even allowing for the dismal characters in PRETTY IN PINK but his scripts have always been marred by an inability to see past the social stereotypes he is trying to send up Thus the kids in THE BREAKFAST CLUB while they learn to respect each other could still be from different planets for all we know We get no sense that they are all under the the mannerisms just human beings There is a funny time around the beginning of high school when kids start developing what it s fashionable to call identity Commensurate with their lack of sophistication they tend to ask what they are rather than who Kids who were formerly friends drift apart as they decide they are jocks nerds freaks and so forth They are uncomfortable stepping outside those categories and fear associations and actions that might leave them adrift without a peer group and the sense of self that it provides Just as adolescence is partly a process of defining oneself by these peer groups rather than by one s family the difficult transition to adulthood is partly about moving from what to who CAN T BUY ME LOVE is about some young people at an Arizona high school trying to traverse the no man s land between group and self and having a hard time of it Ronald is a member of an all male group of nerds but is consumed with anger and envy at the lifestyles of the popular kids and desire for the head cheerleader Cindy Ronald decides that Cindy can be his ticket to the in group and buys her for a month for 1000 Despite Cindy s certainty that you can t buy popularity Ronald in fact becomes the New Kid in Town the most popular senior discarding in the process not only his old friends but also Cindy who had discovered in the old Ronald qualities she admired and wanted This is a difficult and often painful story told with sensitivity and imagination There are none of the mean bigoted stereotypes of PRETTY IN PINK we are able to like and care for Ronald s new friends as much as his old ones This isn t REVENGE OF THE NERDS either although we come to realize that revenge is precisely what Ronald really wanted The price of that almost total revenge is a terrible self knowledge and isolation I felt that CAN T BUY ME LOVE eluded perfection in its last moments due to a morally weak ending Such is Hollywood though that it probably wouldn t have made it into distribution with the one it really deserved That s a small price to pay for what is in every other way a wise and well told story of growing up the hard way CAN T BUY ME LOVE gets the Just Short of Perfect rating which means Go see it for full price if necessary at a good theatre It s not by John Hughes by the way
0133,Puppetoon Movie The,1987,These are the sacrifices that I make to see new animation Well I guess you can t call George Pal s Puppetoons new animation but I had never seen them before so they were new to me I wasn t sure what to expect even after seeing the previews but am I glad that I went Puppetoons were a form of animation where George Pal took various puppets and moved them carved new ones and otherwise manipulated them in the annimation process There is a fluid movement to his Puppetoons which was particularly fun to watch especially during his dance sequences As with most of the early animation these seem to revolve around presenting popular music of the day The clips shown in the movie come primarily from the 1930 s and 1940 s The movie starts with Gumby and friends take me now Lord talking about George Pal You get a series of useless discussions and then finally they get down to showing the puppetoons Most of the clips shown are just that clips that are thrown together I found that to be a little disconcerting but I imagine that they wanted to show us as much as possible There are a few Puppetoons shown in their entirety and they are gems Tulips Shall Grow In Stormy Weather and especially Tubby the Tuba are excellent stories well animated and just a joy to watch The movie got me interested in finding out more about Puppetoons Overall I can t wholeheartedly recommend the movie The clips get tiresome to watch and there is no connection between the different Puppetoons shown Still if you would like to learn about another form of animation and see some wonderful toons go see this movie when it comes to your town
0134,No Way Out,1987,Thriller fans and those able to choke back outrage at blatant stupidity have the best chance of enjoying this film which is blessed with some fine thriller execution and cursed with some hoary thriller cliches NO WAY OUT the new thriller directed by Roger Donaldson is a study in ambivalence Rarely have the elements of a movie been so disparate in their potential to please On the one hand you won t find a better looking or acted movie for grownups offering as many legitimate or illegitimate suspense units On the other hand you have to suffer through some astonishingly lame turns of plot at one point some of the most powerful people in the US government decide it would be a keen idea to launch a room by room search of the Pentagon using a pair of witnesses that s right two people to find a Soviet agent and arguably one of the most arbitrary surprise endings on record Basically the film is much much better than it has a right to be The script is boilerplate turnabout romantic thriller intrigue at the highest levels of power in the US government The writing is adequate to the task It s the execution that makes it worthwhile The movie has as much respect for the audience s intelligence as I can recall in a major Hollywood picture in some time In particular the psychological interplay between the characters and the control of the tone of individual scenes is exceptionally keen I really LIKE not having every little thing s p e l l e d o u t f o r m e in words of one syllable I have to credit the director and the fine cast Kevin Costner Gene Hackman Sean Young and others for most of what s good here In short if you can turn off your reality checker ignore a variety of blatant stupidities put up with several gratuitous chase scenes and believe in the most surprising of surprise endings NO WAY OUT will definitely give you your money s worth But the clash of all these qualities keeps my rating down to 1 2 out of
0135,No Way Out,1987,NO WAY OUT is a splendid example of how to make a good suspense film It has a good plot interesting atmosphere first rate acting well chosen cinematography tense direction and best of all intelligence The elements are very nicely blended into what has to be one of the finest suspense films of the decade The key here is suspense NO WAY OUT isn t an action picture It s a lot more like a classic Hitchcock film with the strongly Hitchcockian plot of a trapped innocent in over his head to go along with it The hero finds himself caught in a web of intrigue and true to the title it does begin to look like there is no way out for him He has to struggle with all his wits just to keep disaster from striking immediately and has little time left to prevent the seemingly inexorable doom that is about to descend To avoid spoiling the effect of NO WAY OUT I ll have to be rather vague about its plot and themes NO WAY OUT concerns a US Navy officer who finds himself unwillingly entangled with Washington politicians in a battle to cut the funding on a huge military project Personal factors further complicate matters and the scheming of politicians eventually threatens his very life Circumstances leave him without any room to move about to be crushed in an impersonal juggernaut Kevin Costner plays the officer giving his best performance to date We can see him not only thinking of how to escape we can see him trying to conceal his thoughts from those around him Costner succeeds best in the most important aspect of his role In order for the audience to become truly worried about his plight the audience has to truly identify with him Costner gives us a figure who deserves our sympathy Costner s previous work has seemed almost like a prepartion for stardom and this role on top of his success in THE UNTOUCHABLES may well do it for him Gene Hackman leads a fine supporting cast giving his reliably solid performance as the Secretary of Defense Credit goes to Hackman and to Robert Garland the screenwriter for giving this character room to show complexities A more typical filming of this story would have presented a figure cut from cardboard This willingness to take the extra effort is representative of the film All of the characters have the opportunity to show themselves as real people rather than story driven placeholders Sean Young George Dzunda Howard Duff and Iman all take advantage of this opportunity The best of the supporting performances is that of Will Patton as Hackman s fiercely loyal hatchetman Patton s intensity is chilling His performance as the underling who puts his patron s success above all else rings all too true Roger Donaldson the director of NO WAY OUT hasn t shown a very special talent before this film A New Zealander he previously directed SMASH PALACE THE BOUNTY and MARIE putting in professional efforts on all of them but demonstrating little more Here though his direction is near perfect Starting from a quiet pace more typical of a drama than a suspense film Donaldson builds to hectic excitement by the end He and cinematographer John Alcott have established a film in which the subtext is claustrophobia The open airy shots near the beginning of the film wind in to tighter and tighter compositions as Costner s situation becomes more and more desperate The intent is to make the audience feel as trapped as Costner s character and it works superbly Alcott in his last film shows again that he was one of the masters of the camera expressing a strong sense of being closed in without ever feeling static The cinematography of NO WAY OUT does not permit him as much chance to display virtuosity as say BARRY LYNDON did but Alcott well shows how a cinematographer can support a film without taking it over Another element of NO WAY OUT deserves special mention the production design The designer ably abets the claustrophobia built by Donaldson and Alcott His sets especially the Pentagon interiors that host most of the film s second half are both accurate and appropriate His Pentagon has very much the tacky and impermanent look of the real thing He plays up the submarine like qualities of the building the long corridors without windows the military drab walls the feeling that despite being the largest building on earth quarters are rather cramped He also gives a feel for the odd topologies of the building the interconnecting offices the concentric ring construction the unexpected facilities and occasional decorations NO WAY OUT is on the whole one of the best films released this year It is both intelligent and entertaining and has the additional advantage of topicality Roger Donaldson crafts his film carefully giving us a film about people in a suspenseful situation rather than mere actors going through the paces NO WAY OUT is a suspense film that Hitchcock would have appreciated far more than any of Brian De Palma s ripoffs One can but hope that audiences appreciate it as well
0136,No Way Out,1987,NO WAY OUT was billed as a suspense thriller along the lines of Hitchcock Let s take a look at the dramatic elements Action Yes there s plenty of action chase scenes in cars trains and on foot and one that is predominantly horizontal Acting Forget it There are so many actors involved and so much action I guess simple movement qualifies that there isn t any time for acting Although there are a few exceptions Will Patton plays the part of Gene Hackman s aide His character appears to be the most rounded or at least the most intense His performance will get some Hollywood heads turning He may should get an Oscar nomination Kevin Costner plays the lead as a naval officer who performs a heroic deed and subsequently gets involved with the Secretary of Defense The only segment of his acting that was valuable was when he found out about his girlfriend s death Costner s performance in THE UNTOUCHABLES was far more dynamic We will no doubt be seeing more of him We hope he will be screening any future scripts more carefully Sean Young delivers interesting insight to the term Washington Socialite A very provocative role Unfortunately Susan appears to have majored in vaginal gymnastics at junior college Gene Hackman has taken on a role that hardly suits his capabilities His horror of killing Susan was the only portion of his role that stands out Howard Duff had a very insignificant role His was almost as empty as Gene Hackman s except Gene had 10 times as much camera time The problem here is that writing has failed some very capable actors Action movement has taken over the movie There was a lot of role playing but very little in character development Plot has suffered due to logistical error Here are some examples A door to door search for the elusive bad guy in the largest building in the world Oh that ought to take a few weeks How about this The Secretary s aide who is gay and is in love with the secretary hears the secretary right in front of him decide to betray the aide as the murderer of the secretary s girlfriend What does the aide do He shoots himself It seems to me that if one is about to be betrayed by someone as omnipotent as the Secretary of Defense has a gun in possession and is within range that he would shoot the secretary Worst of all why is it that a man who is paid cash for the use of a boat is found as a witness and yet they never question the secretary s limo driver The limo driver would have ended the movie before the first 60 boring minutes would have ended I give this one 1 1 2
0137,Eat the Peach,1986,When I told a friend I had gone to see this movie he immediately asked me Why You don t like motorcycles Well motorcycles do play a big part in EAT THE PEACH but they aren t the point of the movie It s all based on a true story about an unemployed Irish laborer who sees a stunt in a videotape of the old Elvis Presley movie ROUSTABOUT and becomes obsessed with duplicating the Wall of Death Vinnie s got the tools to build the wall because a Japanese company left their machinery behind after deciding not to construct their new factory in Northern Ireland He s also got a grasp of mechanics that would be the envy of any engineering undergraduate What he doesn t have is the money for wood but a bit of smuggling can supply that Unfortunately at that point the movie falls apart The Wall of Death itself is treated almost entirely for suspense while the smuggling is treated largely for comic value The whole quirkiness of the situation is underplayed which is a pity because this could have been a very funny movie in the hands of someone like Bill Forsyth But director Peter Ormrod can t resist the urge to melodrama and focuses on too few characters for too long There was plenty of potential for this to be a truly funny movie or a really moving drama but it just can t be both at the same time Still there is an interesting plot likeable characters and a rare opportunity to see how pervasive the influence of the U S is on another culture And you do come to care about Vinnie and his dream Two and a half stars
0138,Masters of the Universe,1987,MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is without a doubt the finest movie based upon a line of toys that I have ever seen While you digest what that means let me go on in more detail A curious mix of low budget production techniques and high tech Richard Edlund effects the film comes off sort of like a production in search of a story The director was apparently distracted by the logistics of the rather ambitious effects and the actors seem to have been left more or less on their own Dolph Lungren has very little to do as He Man but flex Billy Barty who still looks like Billy Barty even under a lot of very good makeup appliances has little to do but provide the regularly scheduled comic relief Frank Langella as the evil Skeletor manages to rise above the material He is practically buried under his skull like makeup which holds up impressively well under long tight shots and still manages to command every scene he s in Another high point is the casting of Meg Foster as Evil Lyn can you believe these names who is best when she just uses those amazing eyes of hers on the camera If you are enough of a special effects freak to subscribe to CINEFEX then you might want to see the film for some of Edlund s more imaginative sequences Otherwise you should probably stay away unless dragged there by your kids Beware before bringing the kinder in a bone headed move they have a police character who says things like Holy sh t In a kid s movie Who was manning the bridge that day That along with the laser whip scene one of the niftier effects probably got them their PG rating I give it 2 00 on a scale of 5 00
0139,Dirty Dancing,1987,Based on the previews you probably wouldn t go see DIRTY DANCING unless you re either bored out of your skull or under 16 And you d miss a real gem I was curious because the screenplay was written by a woman and this is pretty rare for the usual LA LA fare I had visions of my delight at ROMANCING THE STONE for once a heroine not made of perfumed cardboard I was expecting SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER But what I saw was a tight emotional well told story of a fall from innocence With real people It s the summer of 63 the the twilight of the Camelot days If this is a movie for kiddies they ll never understand that special time With Kennedy s death and then into Vietnam we all grew up in a hurry Interestingly as with ROMANCING THE STONE it s the male characters who are a bit stereotypical The male lead one of these days I ll remember names of actors directors et al and write real reviews is a classic noble savage right out of Rousseau but you want to believe it anyway There s also a slimy effete twit who justifies his arrogance in a marvelous scene where he pulls a copy of THE FOUNTAINHEAD out of his pocket and tells the female lead It s all in here I ve made notes in the margins Ah Jennifer Grey She did a first class remarkably subtle job on a part that begs to be overacted And can she dance or what No great piece of cinema but a damn good movie I d give it a solid 2 stars on the Leeper Scale The Ayn Rand trashing scene alone is worth the price of evening admission
0140,Hellraiser,1987,Capsule review Non stop slam bang action creepshow makes writer director Clive Barker seem sicker than he actually is Lots of sex and violence full of sound and fury signifying nothing Clive Barker is the new wunderkind of horror fiction While Stephen King writes pretty much in the well trodden areas of horror clairvoyance psi powers vampires etc Clive Barker seems to create startlingly new ideas that are usually totally off the wall You cannot be sure what territory a Barker story will take you to but you can be pretty sure it won t have anything as familiar and reassuring as a blood sucking vampire You may encounter a malevolent talking pig or a haunted burial shroud one of his more horrific stories involved a giant It was perhaps the first horror story with a giant in two centuries Now following in the footsteps of Stephen King who wrote and directed his own horror film MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE Barker has written and directed HELLRAISER Well I heard someone in the audience echo almost word for word the thoughts I had watching the film The guy who made this film is one sick son of a bitch Take RE ANIMATOR remove the humor than add more gore more graphic violence and more imagination and you have something approaching HELLRAISER The story deals with a man who bought an ornate puzzle box The box seems to be the key to a universe of sex and torture At least I think that was what it was Things are just not very clear Barker who is usually a good story teller just fails to do a very good job of story telling Instead the film devolves into a sequence of imaginative gross out scenes with some very spare connective tissue Nothing makes a whole lot of sense and there is little point in asking If that guy is really the king of the dead or whatever he is why does he have his head marked up like a Rand McNally globe and why has he driven all those nails in his head Does he just think it looks punk HELLRAISER must be the ultimate of some kind of film Whatever it is it certainly is very much what it is If you like the sort of thing that HELLRAISER is you re sure going to love this film And you might want to get some therapy while you are at it I guess I d give HELLRAISER a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0141,Princess Bride The,1987,I admit it I was skeptical I also was hopeful This paradox came about by having read the wonderful book THE PRINCESS BRIDE by William Goldman and being unable to imagine that it could be turned into a successful movie capturing the humor wonder the magic of that book Why then was I hopeful Well the screenplay was written by the same William Goldman who also wrote the screenplay for one of my all time favorite movies BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID And the director was Rob Reiner who has an apparently flawless record with THIS IS SPINAL TAP THE SURE THING and STAND BY ME With mixed feelings I went to see a sneak preview of the movie THE PRINCESS BRIDE For once my optimism was richly rewarded and my cynicism was sent snivelling back under its rock this is a near perfect movie The movie captures as did the book an unabashed affection for heroic fantasy touched with a soft spot for True Love and retaining a deft appreciation for humor Witty warm and still exciting this movie captures the magic that seems so elusive in today s bottom line oriented movie making Of course there is more than just a good screenwriter and director behind this success As I have gleaned from an interview with Norman Lear and Rob Reiner in the Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times and an excerpt published on the net from a cinema magazine this is definitely a labor of love by the principals Rob Reiner fell in love with the book and has been trying to make it for many years William Goldman wrote the screenplay for the book and fought to regain control of it so that it could get made Norman Lear produced the money for the movie when Rob Reiner was having trouble obtaining it with no strings attached Enough about the history how about the movie Well most of the casting is nearly perfect As the mysterious and heroic protaganist of the story newcomer Cary Elwes is perfect Capturing the necessary secure confidence self effacing humility and romantic fervor Elwes is Wesley I didn t recognize Mandy Patinkin as the murdered swordmaker s son Inigo Montoya until part way through the movie He just about stole every scene he was in In fact my favorite scene in the movie is the duel between these two on the brink of the Cliffs of Insanity Similarly well cast was Andre the Giant as the strongman Vizzini Chris Sarandon as the wicked Prince and Christopher Guest as the evil advisor to the prince From there the casting was only a little less effective I wish I could be more enthused about the heroine Another newcomer Robin Wright is beautiful enough as the milkmaid turned princess Buttercup but she seemed to lack some magic sparkle I may be picking at nits but I confess that I thought her a tad wooden Another niggling problem was the casting of some of the bit parts For reasons I can only guess at a number of cameos were filled by to greater or lesser extent well known characters By and large these failed for me to capture the requisite gentle subtle humor that characterized the rest of the movie Wallace Shawn as the Sicilian was particularly strident and unconvincing as a masterful schemer Peter Cook as the Bishop added a jarring note to the wedding scene Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the semi retired miracle worker and his wife added a less distracting note but their scene still retained a touch of schtick To end on a cheery note Peter Falk as the grandfather and the boy who played the sick grandson in the story surrounding the story of the Princess Bride were both excellent In fact I was pleasantly surprised at the understated job Falk turned in as the grandfather slowly arousing the interest of the originally sceptical child The rest of the movie stood out too The scenery and cinematography were not noticeably awkward a frequent problem in fantasy movies While you had to be aware that some of the settings such as the infamous Cliffs were not real there was none of the usual artificial look about places like the Swamp of Fire If I do not notice the scenery too much if the scenery is an integral part of the movie I consider it a success The same holds true for the music With my tin ear the only time I notice the soundtrack is when the music strongly contrasts with what I would expect in a scene In one recent movie I kept wondering Why are they playing this creepy somethings gonna happen music in the middle of the denouement While this may be damning with faint praise Mark Knopfler s score certainly didn t intrude on the scenes at all You ll have to read another review to find out more about how effective the score was The screenplay as I should have expected was wonderful As was noted in the excerpt on the net large amounts of the dialogue were lifted from the book The rest of the dialogue seemed to aptly mesh with the atmosphere that I waxed so enthusiastic about at the beginning of this review My only hesitation is that I saw this at a sneak preview in our large auditorium which has a murky sound system so that I missed some of the dialogue particularly of Andre the Giant who had some good lines Similarly the pacing of the direction was superb There were no flat spots no rushed action All in all I think that THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a must see While I will have to see it again before I confer upon it the status of a classic I will give it a strong 3 on the 4 to 4 scale I may well give it a 4 after a second viewing Clark Starring Cary Elwes Robin Wright Chris Sarandon Christopher Guest Mandy Patinkin Andre the Giant Screenplay William Goldman Music Mark

0142,Dirty Dancing,1987,I went to see DIRTY DANCING because one of the critics on a NY independent station loved it Not that I always listen to the critics far from it believe me but he gave it such a glowing review that I couldn t resist I had not seen any of the ads for it Which is probably a good thing since it s being pushed as the next SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER FLASHDANCE FOOTLOOSE type movie Obviously they hope to draw the teenagers who spend most of the big bucks on movie tickets Well don t be fooled by this bogus advertising The movie has more to offer than slick dancing And it doesn t fall into the all too familiar trap of gratuitous female flesh used only to satisfy a bunch of horny teenage boys This movie is not about anything new the pain of growing up has been dealt with in many movies But I can t remember another one that does it with such charm and affection Baby Jennifer Grey goes to the Catskills with her family for a three week vacation In three weeks her world changes forever she becomes a woman an adult She s not Daddy s little Baby anymore There is pain and turmoil but also humor It s like real life and maybe that s why I liked it so much The title DIRTY DANCING comes from the fact that the help at the hotel engage in very close dancing at their parties and it is seeing this dancing for the first time that starts Baby s transformation The acting is wonderful These people seem real You feel for them And they can all dance It s nice to see actors and actresses dancing instead of dancers doing the dancing and actors doing the acting Both Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze started out as dancers It s to their credit that they can act too Together they are like dynamite dancing or acting And I can t stop without saying something about Patrick Swayze I think all the women in the theater were sighing He just takes your breath away So forget the advertising Go see the movie It will make you feel better The Catskills are mountains in NY State where many New York City Jews spent their summers my great grandparents grandparents parents and me included Though it looks like the Catskills the movie was actually filmed at a pretty hotel on a lake in southwestern Virginia near Blacksburg
0143,Big Easy The,1987,Things are happening pretty fast in The Big Easy that s the town you and I know as New Orleans The Big Easy is called that because things go pretty slow and easy down there at least most of the time But just now the police are investigating a gang war that is anything but easy Some hoods wise guys they re called are getting killed in some pretty nasty ways The police including Remy McSwain played by Dennis Quaid are investigating But the police are themselves being investigated The Assistant District Attorney Anne Osborne played by Ellen Barkin is in there looking for signs of police corruption Now Remy comes from a family of policeman and they are all good guys but like other policemen they do take advantage of certain privileges they get for being policemen And that s the kind of thing that Osborne want to know more about THE BIG EASY has three stars Quaid Barkin and New Orleans ANGEL HEART made New Orleans seem a little sinister THE BIG EASY shows you a friendlier happier New Orleans With all the slap happy fun down at the Police Department you wonder how anyone ever gets anything done fighting crime Everyone is just a good old boy who loves Cajun music gators and Tabasco Sauce It is a charming picture whether or not it is true Quiad is likable as McSwain though his Cajun accent seems a little forced and varies in intensity from scene to scene The odd thing is that the plot seems fresh and original until the last ten minutes or so Then suddenly things start looking like just about every other police film of the last five years And that is a shame since that last impression is the one that stays with you THE BIG EASY is good as a travelogue and at least passable as a police story and as an object lesson in honesty Rate the film a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0144,Living on Tokyo Time,1987,I just saw LIVING ON TOKYO TIME last weekend and I saw WISH YOU WERE HERE a few weeks ago Both were great WISH YOU WERE WERE HERE is reviewed in another article ecl LIVING ON TOKYO TIME is a comedy about a Japanese girl who comes to the United States after her fiance dumps her for another woman After she is here for a while she realizes that she must find a way to stay or she will be deported One of her co workers suggests that she marry someone so that she can get a permanent residency visa This is where Ken steps in A Japanese American musician with a heavy metal band he has just broken up with his girlfriend He has nothing better to do so he gets married She speaks only a little English he speaks no Japanese The two come from two different worlds they could be different planets and have little in common The story then revolves around the trials and tribulations of a marriage between two people who nothing about each other One note LIVING ON TOKYO TIME is a very dry comedy There is not much excitement but there are some good laughs I would give it a 8 out of 10
0145,Wish You Were Here,1987,I just saw LIVING ON TOKYO TIME last weekend and I saw WISH YOU WERE HERE a few weeks ago Both were great WISH YOU WERE WERE HERE is reviewed in another article ecl WISH YOU WERE HERE is based on the first part of the biography of Cynthia Payne the character that PERSONAL SERVICES is based on It is directed and written by David Leland the writer of MONA LISA with Neil Jordan and PERSONAL SERVICES The star Emily Lloyd is the brightest thing to hit movie screens this year The story is about a young girl who tries to rebel against her father and society by swearing like a truck driver and using sexual promiscuity to shock people Her favorite saying she says it often is up your bum But as she realizes what her actions have done she begins to realize the consequences that she must begin to face The movie ends with her making some very crucial decisions about how she will live her life
0146,Race for the Double Helix The,1987,For years the issue has been hotly contested How good is British television really I think everyone agrees that some of the best things on American television came from Britain It is hard to beat programs like I CLAUDIUS but they are just a few occasional good programs Certainly British television has its share of stupid situation comedies that do not get seen over here Well it seems to me that their good programs are so good that their bad television shows can easily be overlooked Around the middle of September I start thinking back on what was the best film I have seen the previous summer I had pretty well determined it was to be De Palma s UNTOUCHABLES this year when just under the wire I saw something better And it was a made for TV film made by the BBC for British television The film ran on the Arts and Entertainment cable station and was called THE RACE FOR THE DOUBLE HELIX It featured superb acting by Jeff Goldblum as James D Watson and Tim Piggot Smith as Francis Crick Watson and Crick are the two unconventional scientists who worked out the structure of DNA The film is about many things Among other things it is about a conflict between two approaches to science You can go for the gold or glory in the truth and doing things the right way The first approach is personified by Goldblum s Watson a boorish Yank who is a duomaniac His goals are to get a girl and a Nobel Prize Anything in life that does not further his attempts at one goal or the other is not to be tolerated Espousing the other point of view is Rosalinda Franklin to whom science is a turn the crank operation of putting enough work into your goal going from square one to square two to square three until you have achieved your goal without once making an intuitive leap The film is about the politics of science and the viewer comes away with an education in how those politics work as well as one of how the structure of DNA was determined It is the story of how three men won a Nobel Prize based greatly on the work of one woman who neither got a piece of the prize nor because she was a woman was she even allowed to join the men in the lounge of the building where they worked THE RACE FOR THE DOUBLE HELIX is a powerful excellent film If this sort of thing gets shown often on the BBC I may pack my bag Rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0147,Fourth Protocol The,1987,Frederick Forsyth has written several thrillers and several of them have been adapted into movies starting with his first the excellent THE DAY OF THE JACKAL THE FOURTH PROTOCOL marks the first time that Forsyth also did the screenplay adaptation Pierce Brosnan who wanted to play James Bond is now on the other side he plays a top Russian agent who is sent to England to do a very dirty piece of work against the NATO alliance It will violate the fourth protocol of a certain treaty hence the title Michael Caine who has starred in spy movies from THE IPCRESS FILE up to the current THE WHISTLE BLOWER plays the man who is trying to stop him Caine s world in this movie is not far removed from that of THE IPCRESS FILE though perhaps a bit less grotty Caine and Brosnan and the supporting cast also turn in decent performances the direction was unspectacular but the story kept moving along On the whole I found the movie entirely satisfactory except for the most important thing the script Some types of movies can stand large to middling implausibilities in the script I loved THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS rate it 7 50 Cdn and recommend it just for fun even to other non fans of James Bond But a serious thriller such as THE FOURTH PROTOCOL must meet higher standards I ll be vague about details to avoid any spoilers But to give you an idea The premise of the Russian plot made sense but their implementation did not it allowed too many chances for the discovery of one piece to tip NATO off to the whole thing Just as well otherwise there would have been no movie but still One piece of tactics is used so many times that by the last time it has become predictable that scene also contains a silly mistake I was thinking Ah he s doing it that way so as to avoid that cliche error giving away his plans and one minute later the cliche was shown as having occurred anyway Also the ending seemed abrupt with an explicit unanswered question I wondered if a sequel is contemplated
0148,Fourth Protocol The,1987,Frederick Forsyth writes good suspense stories about political intrigue He is best known for THE DAY OF THE JACKAL and THE ODESSA FILE They are clearly written and tense thrillers though if the truth be known there is a certain sameness about them While there are major consequences to what is happening his stories really come down to a sort of chessgame between two men one good and one evil Nobody else is really important in the story Just about everyone else is a prop THE FOURTH PROTOCOL is a new film based on a novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth THE DAY OF THE JACKAL dealt with a lone assassin in the pay of political extremists whose mission is to kill Charles DeGaulle We see how the assassin works and thinks We also see a police investigator one who is not altogether popular with his superiors and we see how he is able to discover an amazing amount of information about the assassin And that information together with a modicum of dumb luck are sufficient to avert the assassination With minor substitutions we have the same story here Instead of a political extremist group we have a rogue general in Soviet intelligence The general sends a sort of assassin Petrofsky played by Pierce Brosnan to head up an operation in Britain Trying to uncover the operation is John Preston played by an aging Michael Caine Preston takes his orders these days from an officious supervisor played by Julian Glover who seems to make a career of playing unlikeable officials including Breen in FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH Only this time the assassin s mission is not to kill a single man THE FOURTH PROTOCOL is solidly acted with Caine a likeable if independent minded agent Pierce Brosnan is not very good at showing emotion but as emotionless killers he is just fine There are a host of other familiar faces including I think and someone can correct me if I am wrong the same actor who plays Max Headroom in this film playing an obnoxious American As suspense films go THE FOURTH PROTOCOL is not the most cerebral but it is several cuts about American suspense films like BEVERLY HILLS COP Give it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0149,Jean de Florette,1986,I m surprised that nobody has posted a review of this excellent film which won the major award at Cannes this year Actually there was one by Jeff Meyer available as r a m r 89 ecl JEAN DE FLORETTE is a vivid adaptation of the Marcel Pagnol novel about peasant life in southern France between the wars Papet Yves Montand wishes to acquire a neighbor s land in order to establish his nephew Ugolin Daniel Auteuil However the neighbor dies and his heir Jean Gerard Depardieu a city dweller arrives intending to settle down and farm the land according to the systems described in his books Papet and Ugolin conceal the spring on Jean s land which is what makes the land valuable in this dry landscape and sit back to watch Jean fail They hope that he will give up and sell them the land This description does not do justice to this extraordinarily rich film Papet and Ugolin are not standard cardboard villains but sympathetic characters with understandable though not necessarily admirable reasons for doing the things they do Jean is a sympathetic character but also rather pompous and ludicrous in his faith in his manuals The film shows how closed to outsiders village life can be and how primitive life there was before the war All the performances in the film are excellent and the photography is beautiful The script is intelligent with many subtle motivations and connections between characters hinted at but not explained JEAN DE FLORETTE is the first part of a two part film The second part MANON DES EAUX MANON OF THE SPRINGS was released in France at the same time as JEAN DE FLORETTE but I have heard that MANON DES EAUX will be released in the United States around Christmas Although MANON DES EAUX is the natural sequel see the first film and you ll see what I mean JEAN DE FLORETTE is itself a self contained film and filmgoers should not go expecting an incomplete open ended story I give JEAN DE FLORETTE 3 1 2 stars out of 4 and eagerly await MANON DES EAUX
0150,Hellraiser,1987,This review contains spoilers but believe me I don t say anything you can t guess 10 minutes into the movie I did go into this one with high expectations I had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks I sort of expected another EXORCIST or THE SHINING I even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film Boy was I wrong Another garbage slasher flick the only difference being that this one has a story The story you ask Well a scumball buys a Chinese puzzle from a guy in an Arab souk He takes it home somehow getting it past Customs and starts fiddling with it in his attic Lo and behold after he takes it apart three demons appear and start taking him apart but with meat hooks When they re finished his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling They botch up their cleanup job however and manage to leave his heart or some gland I didn t really recognize the organ under a floorboard The guy s brother and his brother s wife appear at the door soon after and decide to move in They throw away Scumball s belongings and set up house Turns out that Wife is a bit of a nympho and screwed around with Scumball right before her marriage She starts having some wild hallucinations Later Hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground all from the tiny cut on his hand Said blood is eagerly sucked up by Scumball s Organ The Organ grows into a Thing that requires Yet More Blood in order to complete the Regeneration into a Really Ugly Thing It establishes mind contact with Wife who agrees to help him get more blood because she really wants to be screwed again So she helps him kill three businessmen Scumball at this time gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back Problem is he doesn t have any skin and even after three or four corpses still doesn t get any skin He finally gets some though but strangely enough he ends up looking like his brother Guess they couldn t get the original actor back Who knows Scumball whose name is Frank is not a nice guy He describes his torture by the demons fondly as the ultimate pleasure and pain since at that level there is no difference between the two Somehow I don t see getting torn apart by 90 fish and meat hooks a lot of fun This guy is so bad How bad is he so bad that the rats cower in a corner in fear For good reason too he crucifies two of them for fun and carves a third while the Nympho s horsing around with Hubby Anyway Hubby s Daughter who if course is not WIFE S daughter starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees Wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams The dumb bimbo meets Scumball and is not impressed She manages to escape with the Chinese Puzzle and brings out the demons At any rate the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing The story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake The demons are not however the good guys The dumb bimbo s the good guy She somehow not only gets them to take care of Frank but also banishes them to Hell or oblivion we re not too sure which Not too shabby for someone with single digit IQ This is basically a bad jinn story It is an awful movie Awful acting bad focus in the photography many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks which is really unrealistic and looks like the latex that it is Continuity Who cares Acting Terrible Script Horrible Sounds canned Unrealistic Story is so so but the impact is lost long long before the film ends I do think the rat acting was quite good I have never seen rats look afraid They should get nominated for an award Really good acting there the best in the movie The envelope for Best Furry Rodent please A one star out of four rating would be far too generous A 1 10 rating or 4 in the 4 to 4 rating system is far more accurate This movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog I can see this film turning into the next ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW People were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen Had to have something to do Dumb dumb dumb movie I was embarrassed that I spent money to see it It goes without saying that I disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself Lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute horror in my opinion
0152,Stakeout,1987,STAKEOUT C This film isn t without its charms Dreyfus carries so much of the film due to his sheer likability and Emilio Estevez does a creditable job as Dreyfus s partner But the film ends in an incredibly predictable chase scene with Dreyfus s new girlfriend falling into a cliched damsel in distress routine Towards the end she seems to have little purpose other than to satisfy sexual and heroic fantasies THE FOURTH PROTOCOL C but it is the archetypical Thriller Probably the easiest way to put this if you liked DAY OF THE JACKAL Fredrick Forsythe not only wrote the books both films are based on but he wrote the screenplay for THE FOURTH PROTOCOL you ll love this one It provides what you expect from a thriller a plot that keeps you thinking throughout the movie and which doesn t insult your intelligence It is a rare film that doesn t ask me to overlook a mistake in the story or a stupid action by a character to advance the plot but this is one of them As to characterization and dialogue that is deficient but in this type of thriller characterization is almost always secondary to the plot Only the very tail ending seems outlandish and that lasts only a few seconds the rest is the type of entertainment that keeps your mind buzzing as it winds along THE BIG EASY B Almost the opposite of THE FOURTH PROTOCOL this film is loaded with wonderful characters and dialogue but the plot tends to get incredible at the end And again I enjoyed the film over all though I had a bit of a problem swallowing some of it towards the finale The accents are worth the price alone and some of the dialogue is precious particularly by the actor who plays the defense lawyer for Dennis Quaid I also found Ellen Barkin to be exceptional in creating a rather guileless character when she begins to return Quaid s attentions she lets her reserve metamorphose into a delightfully shy demeanor AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON Arggh give it a D This is one of those anthology skit films like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE John Landis produced both films and seems to be returning to his roots with this one KFM was his first big hit which means you can t grade it as a whole you have to grade it on average On average then I d give it a D there are a handful of very funny sketches here but you have to wade through some awful stuff to get to it The sketches preceding the Amazon Women on the Moon sketch which progresses throughout the film are particularly bad especially the first Things get better as you go on which is perhaps a good idea most people remember the ending more than they do the beginning of the film If you ever get the video I recommend you fast forward to the Amazon Women sketches the Video Pirates sketch Oh We re SOOOOOOO scared the Jack the Ripper sketch the First Lady of the Night sketch Easy to read typeface no big words Available at bus stations and airports everywhere and Ed Begley Jr s hilarious sketch as the very visible Invisible Man P S Stick around after the credits there s another sketch with Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartel at the end BEST SELLER D I went in really wanting to like this as James Woods and Brian Dennehy are two of my favorite character actors Unfortunately Dennehy walks through his role which is somewhat understandable considering just how bad the script is Plenty of instances of characters doing something really stupid just to advance the plot James Woods creates another fascinating character this time a hit man who is a fascinating monster utterly repugnant and entirely fascinating at points However he can t carry a plot like this on his shoulders for the entire running time and you just give in to the stupidities of the story after a half hour P S For those of you who ve seen the NEW MONKEES Coca Cola ads preceding so many of the films are these guys the lamest little no talent weasels to come down the pike in years or what Please give me the stupid animated shots of popcorn in space and empty cups flying into wastebaskets Or better yet the John Waters Please don t smoke ad hilarious
0153,Country,1984,Every month cable dredges up a bunch of older films to fill up their programming schedules the quality of these films is spotty at best This month seems to have a better selection of filler films than usual These films running on cable this month all rate a 2 or higher on the 4 to 4 scale at least in my opinion COUNTRY 1984 One of three save the farm films that came out at the same time This was the only one that was really believable though PLACES IN THE HEART was a good story The people looked the part and acted the part A strong piece of human drama 2 Cinemax and Showtime FUNERAL IN BERLIN 966 The producers of the James Bond films tried to have a second series based on Len Deighton s books about an unnamed agent the films called him Harry Palmer THE IPCRESS FILE and FUNERAL IN BERLIN were both good spy stories The series was killed when Ken Russell horribly mishandled BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN the third film On the axis between action and believability with Fleming at one end and LeCarre at the other these stories sit nicely in the middle Michael Caine plays the laconic anti establishment agent 2 Cinemax A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS 1966 This is probably my favorite of all time In the days before videotape I had it on audiotape and played it often once or twice a week Thomas More is a man of wit and brilliance and above all integrity The play itself is full of bitter humor and meaty ethical argument It will not be for all tastes but it is a fine film 4 Cinemax OBSESSION 1976 Brian DePalma made this film while Hitchcock was making his last film FAMILY PLOT Had I not seen the credits of the two films I would have guessed that this was the Hitchcock It is in the style of some of Hitchcock s best films and ranks with them DePalma who made Stephen King a household name with CARRIE also seems to have discovered John Lithgow featuring him in this film and BLOWOUT 2 HBO OUTLAW JOSEY WALES 1976 Clint Eastwood s best film though BRONCO BILLY is not far behind Eastwood is just one of several interesting and three dimensional characters in a story that is as much about the shape of the country at the close of the Civil War as it is an action Western 3 Cinemax and Showtime I seem to remember THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD based on the novel by John LeCarre as being pretty good but I haven t seen it since the 1960s It is on Cinemax
0154,La Bamba,1987,Meteoric is the word for the career of Ritchie Valens who signed a recording contract became successful had three top ten singles and died all in a span of eight months He died in a plane crash at age 17 having only months before been a Mexican American farmworker named Ricardo Valenzuela LA BAMBA is the story of that last year of his life Biographical films about singers give a brutally realistic picture of their subjects worlds present a fawning tribute or lie somewhere in between LA BAMBA does a little of both Valens is a pure hearted good guy with a vision of what kind of music he wants to create a white knight of Rock and Roll Contrasting with him is his brother Bob played by Esai Morales who played the bully villain of BAD BOYS BOB IS A SELF CENTERED FAILURE HE DEALS DRUGS DRINKS TOO MUCH MISTREATS THE WOMAN HE STOLE FROM RITCHIE AND GENERALLY TURNS HIS OWN FRUSTRATIONS INTO PAIN AND TROUBLE FOR THOSE AROUND HIM HIS BASENESS SOMEHOW IS A LITTLE EASIER TO BELIEVE THAN RITCHIE S LOFTINESS BUT TOGETHER THEY JUST ABOUT MAKE ONE WHOLE PERSON IN FACT BOB IS THE MORE INTERESTING OF THE TWO CHARACTERS RITCHIE S STORY IS OF THE IDEALIST WHO MAKES GOOD A SORT OF LATTER DAY HORATIO ALGER STORY BUT THROUGH BOB S CHARACTER WE LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT MEXICAN AMERICAN FARMWORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITY WHICH IS MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN JUST ANOTHER STORY OF A SINGER S SUCCESS WHERE LA BAMBA s story is the most questionable is in its little brushes with the occult We are told that Ritchie had repeated nightmares and premonitions about plane crashes As a result he has a terrible fear of flying which he must reluctantly push aside to fulfill the demands of stardom We are also told that he has lost every coin toss of his life except the one which put him on the flight which killed him He apparently wins that toss but the audience knows better If the premonitions indeed pointed to the way he would die they should be better documented than just being thrown into a film If they did not really occur then the screenwriter should not claim they did in what is otherwise supposed to be a factual story But LA BAMBA is good entertainment even if before the film like me you couldn t reliably name a single one of Valens s hits I still got caught up in the excitement of the creation of a new kind of music even if it is not the kind of music I generally enjoy Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0155,Dirty Dancing,1987,At least one film critic and one three dimensional person have told me that DIRTY DANCING is the SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER of the 1980s I can see what they mean The dancing hooks the kids and then they see a good story of human values anyway It s a good way to solve the problem of I don t want to see a film with character development hey let s get Mikey to watch it The problem is that while the story is good it is a little pat Things work out a little too well Life is not really like that SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is a genuine slice of life film Things do not all work out right but they do work out like they do in life It is not true at the end of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER that all s right with the world but some progress has been made and that is a victory DIRTY DANCING is a good film too It is good like ON GOLDEN POND But it lacks the grit of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER DIRTY DANCING is the story set in 1963 of how Baby Houseman played by Jennifer Grey comes of age during a two week stay at a resort in the Catskill Mountains Actually the resort film is becoming its own sub genre The best of the lot is probably THE GIG She gets involved with the resort dance instructor played by Patrick Swayze and Penny a pregnant but unwed dancer played by Cynthia Rhodes Baby has a natural desire to get involved with people in trouble and try to set things right but in doing so she risks hurting her own relationship with her father played by Jerry Orbach The title refers to two or three steamy scenes of dancing but really erotic dirty dancing is sort of a paste on to the plot Professional mambo dancing is much more important but let s face it who under 60 years of age would go to see a film called PROFESSIONAL MAMBO DANCING When it got to video it would end up with the instruction tapes Acting honors for the piece go to Grey who really does seem to transform but they also go to Jerry Orbach who presents a real aura of integrity He is sort of the father that everyone wishes they had For being a little too neat and pat this film gets a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0156,Princess Bride The,1987,One of the advantages of being a proficient and successful writer is that you can write what you like and do not have to worry that this idea is too silly and readers will laugh at it One of the advantages of being a proficient and successful director is that you can make the kind of films you like and do not have to worry that the idea is too silly for audiences William Goldman has written such successful books as NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY MAGIC MARATHON MAN and SOLDIER IN THE RAIN So when he decides to write a book length fairy tale his publisher knows he can pull it off And when Rob Reiner who was not much of an actor but as a director of three films the worst of which was as good as THE SURE THING wants to direct it he isn t going to have too much trouble getting up the mazuma to make a fairy tale movie Princess are you ready for this Buttercup played by Robin Wright is to be the unfortunate bride of Prince Humperdinck played by FRIGHT NIGHT s Chris Sarandon But the only man she has ever loved was the callow youth Westley played by Cary Elwes of LADY JANE who was killed off screen by a notorious pirate Buttercup would like revenge on the pirate and she isn t too fond of her fiance either And speaking of revenge Inigo Montoya played by Mandy Patinkin would like some against the six fingered man who killed his father They could get revenge together but unfortunately Inigo s current job involves him and two friends including Fezzik the giant played by Andre the also Giant kidnapping and murdering Buttercup Then there s the little boy who would rather play videogames than listen to his grandfather s story Yeah well he s in there too It is hard to find fault with as well meaning and enjoyable a film as this offbeat fairy tale The real problem is that the characters are flat so that one is never really drawn into the story Reiner can create characters we like and believe and had he done it here the film would have been just about perfect As it is the story feels a little thin and too short for its material Something is wrong when the only one likable character is played by a quarter ton of professional wrestler Beyond that all I can say is this is the most fun you will have in a film for quite a while I could tell you why this fractured fairy tale is fun but most of what is fun catches you off guard I couldn t convey the fun and I d probably ruin the gags Rate the movie a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0157,Princess Bride The,1987,I went to see THE PRINCESS BRIDE at a sneak preview in Seattle on Saturday night Admittedly I went with extremely high expectations perhaps the highest I have ever had for a movie due to positive reviews and the presence of some extremely talented people on the movie credits It is perhaps to be expected that I was not completely delighted with the movie but that is more because due to time constraints so much was left out than because anything was seriously screwed up It is indeed a very very enjoyable film I would give it a solid 8 on a scale of 1 10 with previous 9s being STAR WARS LA BAMBA and CASABLANCA LABYRINTH another 8 and ROMANCING THE STONE and LADYHAWKE a 7 Now you know what I like so you can adjust your perceptions accordingly The dialog is crisp and the costuming is appropriately colorful just this side of silly real fairy tale stuff not historically accurate medieval rags and linsey woolsey The music was slightly jarring though I found that I noticed it just a bit more than I like in a movie and the final song Storybook Love playing during the credits was frankly awful I admit that I have little experience rating direction but I think that as far as I could tell it was very good In general though I liked it a lot and will go back to see it again at least twice It is extremely light hearted unabashed romantic silliness which I think is just fine As a swashbuckler movie it leaves a little to be desired the swash and buckle are somewhat uneven lots in the beginning and end little in the middle but the characterization as noted before is excellent Buttercup really does have hair the color of autumn and Westley really does have eyes like a sea before a storm Inigo and Fezzik are excellently cast and Rugen is wonderfully slimy I found Wally Shawn as Vizzini the Sicilian somewhat jarring because much of his character was eliminated he s not telepathic for example in the movie nor was he a hunchback and the comic elements were emphasized more than the dizzying intellect Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as Max and Valerie were enjoyable although I found that I really would have liked to see Buttercup s parents and the Princess Noreena of Guilder three characters the movie leaves out entirely The King and Queen of Florin had much smaller roles in the movie as well The settings were great with one exception On location scenes in Ireland and England were wonderful However the duel on the top of the Cliffs of Insanity was just a little too obviously filmed on a sound stage I found the transition from that to the real location scenes following a little bit weird General conclusion It was great Go see it You will almost certainly like it I have minor quibbles but that s IT Definitely one of the top two movies of the year for me My one quibble is with the extent in which the movie was true to the spirit of the book Spoilers follow so be warned In general the movie is much much more light hearted than the book Westley s deaths both the first and the second time are treated more seriously in the book Buttercup s reaction to the first death is handled with more tragedy in the book and little Billy s reaction to the second death is explored in more detail in the book I found that after the second death in the movie I was in a state where I was convinced he would come back Forget for a moment that I read the book and knew he would come back and wasn t taking it as seriously as I did in the book when I was beginning to get worried after the second death that he really was dead Additionally a lot of William Goldman s sniping in the book is gone sideswipes at his wife his editors his publishers and so the undercurrent of black humor is missing THE PRINCESS BRIDE the movie is much more a fairy tale than THE PRINCESS BRIDE the book which was almost a satire at many points Also I disagree with the person who stated that the dialog followed that in the book almost exactly This really isn t so to the degree I had hoped Part of the problem is that THE PRINCESS BRIDE the book is able to utilize long descriptive passages by Goldman and THE PRINCESS BRIDE the movie has to show these scenes rather than allow one to imagine them A lot was left out for example of Buttercup s early years We are completely at a loss to understand how Buttercup met Prince Humperdinck and married him a few lines of voiceover between Westley s death and Buttercup s presentation to the people of Florin is all we get Inigo Montoya s story is well done he tells it to the man in black essentially as it was in the book but Fezzik s is left out entirely The whole Snow Sand episode which I found one of the most exciting in the book is difficult to reproduce on film so all we see is Buttercup falling in Westley diving in and the two of them emerging I wish Princess Noreena of Guilder had been left in The part I feel most ambiguous about no wonder is that the ending of the film is completely different from the ending in the book Now I realize that a fairy tale movie ought to have a fairy tale ending but I really miss the sense of HUH I got at the end of the book It was fun to be completely misled that way The ending of the movie while sweet and happily ever after nice simply does not give you that feeling Those of you who feel that the way the book ended was complete and absolute heresy will like it though
0158,Maurice,1987,SUMMARY MAURICE tells the story of a platonic love affair between Maurice Hall and his Cambridge classmate Clive Durham which took place when homosexuality was still a criminal offense in England Under societal pressures to conform Clive tries to suppress his love for Maurice and marries a dull upper class woman Maurice also tries to suppress his attraction for men but eventually comes to term with his feelings and casts aside the homophobic and class divisive values of his society MAURICE is quite a bit more exciting than the above summary suggests It s a fantasy romance with elements of a grim reality the cruel persecution of gay love Maurice Hall is outwardly an ordinary man an upstanding member of wealthy English society as is Clive Durham But they share a secret Each loves the other Maurice has been attracted to men as long as he can remember but he was never able to discuss these feelings with anyone because the teachers clergymen constantly tell their wards about the unspeakable sin of the Greeks and watched them constantly It is by accident that Maurice meets Clive at Cambridge Their friendship blossoms and the two fall in love but for a long time neither is capable of acknowledging his emotion for the other The movie succeeds beautifully in capturing the moods of romantic love the wistful longing glances the words almost but not quite spoken The interior settings are rich with period details and everything radiates warmth The outdoor settings are equally romantic The fields and woods always appear green lush and misty Clive s country estate possessed a dignified timeless charm as filmed by director James Ivory The costuming was equally flawless as with A ROOM WITH A VIEW the previous film by the Merchant Ivory producer director team The most interesting part of the movie s storyline for me involves the two paths taken by Clive and Maurice in response to the trial of their mutual friend Lord Risley Entrapped by a policeman Risley was sent to hard labor for committing a homosexual offense Clive becomes ill with worry and fear and eventually breaks off his affair with Maurice to marry a woman and enter a career in politics These changes however are nothing more than monumental acts of self deception for Clive Maurice also tries to conform He goes to a hypnotist who tries to cure him of his sickness Maurice eventually comes to accept his gay sexual identity and ends up the happier for it James Wilby turns in a convincing performance as the torn Maurice This role was originally to be played by Julian Sands who played George in A ROOM WITH A VIEW I think James Wilby s appearance is more suited for the role of the ordinary man which Maurice is Julian Sands would have been too pretty Hugh Grant plays dashing Clive Durham and manages to effectively communicate the pathetic changes that occur in Clive keep track of who has the mustache The supporting cast is generally amusing Ben Kingsley puts in a appearance as the American hypnotist MAURICE presents a positive idealized view of gay love in comparison to the grim depiction of a gay marriage in PRICK UP YOUR EARS The author E M Forster wrote it with a happy ending in mind with the idea that two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows and said that he shouldn t have bothered to write otherwise The story s main weakness is the contrivedness of some of the meetings re Maurice Alec I enjoyed the movie a great deal and found these faults to be minor As a matter of fact I ll probably go back to see it again soon which is my way of saying this is one of the best movies I ve seen this year MAURICE Starring James Wilby Hugh Grant Rupert Holmes Also starring Denholm Elliott Ben Kingsley and many others Director James Ivory Producer Ismail Merchant Adapted from the novel MAURICE by E M Forster
0159,Maurice,1987,Capsule review Disappointing E M Forster entry by much of the same team that made A ROOM WITH A VIEW A plea for acceptance of homosexuality flounders in melodrama florid production values and even a mild dash of sexism There is enough quality present to make the film worth seeing but not as much as you d think Rating 1 The following review contains spoilers and opinions that are going to draw flak Over the last few years there has been a discovery of the works of E M Forster by filmmakers Until A PASSAGE TO INDIA I don t think anyone had ever filmed a Forster novel Since then we have seen A ROOM WITH A VIEW and now MAURICE The new entry is the story of a homosexual Maurice pronounced Morris Hall who discovered his own homosexuality at Cambridge and a bunch of other people s as he went along MAURICE tells the story of his discomfort in a country that is disinclined to accept human nature Maurice becomes aware of his homosexuality at Cambridge where we are shown that he runs into no women who are attractive or interesting There are darn few women in the whole film who are not portrayed as superficial and vacuous But there are lots of pretty men running around In class they read classics with references to homosexuality the professors tell the boys just to skip over the explicit parts and interpret the rest as platonic love One thing sort of leads to another and Maurice meets Clive Durham who is close and pretty and soon they are pretty close The film follows their affair for a few years until Clive decides to buckle under to public pressure and marry someone of the opposite sex instead It isn t long before he is telling Maurice how he was surprised to find that women are nice too It is the only scene in the film that has much nice to say about women Maurice tries to have an American hypnotist played by Ben Kingsley doing his best to sound like a Texan cure him but it doesn t work and soon Maurice decides that if he cannot have Clive he will have Clive s assistant gamekeeper There are always two parts to an E M Forster story There is the story itself and there is the social comment A PASSAGE TO INDIA in addition to having a good story argued cogently for home rule for India I became firmly convinced that Britain did the right thing almost forty years ago A ROOM WITH A VIEW argued that Edwardian social custom really screwed up people s lives and I left the theater shouting Down with Edwardian social custom It too told a good story MAURICE is perhaps the most relevant to our society and even in that it is more than seventy years out of date but the story itself is not very good this time around It is overly long in the telling about 140 minutes and is much more melodramatic than director Ivory s previous ROOM WITH A VIEW I think Ivory wanted to repeat that film s success so he put in many of the same faces forced Ben Kingsley into the wrong role chose a not very good novel and then gave it a long and florid treatment With the talents involved the film could not go wrong but one would expect a much better rating than a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0160,Whistle Blower The,1986,Britain seems to be a hotbed of spy scandal these days and the interest seems to have made its way into art There s the uproar over SPYCATHCHER new biographies of Anthony Blount and several books on the British Secret Service In the movies we have last spring s DEFENSE OF THE REALM and this summer s THE FOURTH PROTOCOL and THE WHISTLE BLOWER I haven t seen THE FOURTH PROTOCOL but THE WHISTLE BLOWER is far inferior to DEFENSE OF THE REALM although they both cover similar ground In DEFENSE OF THE REALM a newspaperman who breaks a sex spy scandal involving an MP discovers that this is merely a smokescreen for something far more disturbing even to a jaded moviegoer like me In THE WHISTLE BLOWER a Russian mole in a British electronic intelligence organization and the death of a number of people in suspicious circumstances draws the interest of one of the organization s Russian linguists and then of his father played by Michael Caine who also appears in THE FOURTH PROTOCOL Unfortunately unlike DEFENSE OF THE REALM which offers us something new in the way of political thriller THE WHISTLE BLOWER offers us little beyond conventional spy stuff that is done much more inventively by John LeCarre Caine seems to do little in the film except listen to people of the right and the left make speeches defending their actions The ending is both a letdown and not entirely comprehensible I think that the premise of THE WHISTLE BLOWER would have been more effective if the story had been told differently Film is a visual medium and story telling in film is most effective then this visual aspect is exploited and verbal exposition is kept to a minimum DEFENSE OF THE REALM used the visual possibilities of film admirably although it was far from polished THE WHISTLE BLOWER resorts to tired cliches and boring speeches we ve heard before For comparison in an earlier review I gave DEFENSE OF THE REALM 3 stars out of 4 although I might give it 3 1 2 stars now I would only give THE WHISTLE BLOWER 2 stars It s not awful only disappointing
0161,Whistle Blower The,1986,There s a dark world and a light world They co exist side by side Most of us live in the light world and think we have some idea of what is going on Sometimes we do and sometimes we don t Sometimes what we think we know has been a play put on for our benefit by the people who live in the dark world It s the dark world that s real That is the theme of a new film a murder mystery with espionage overtones THE WHISTLE BLOWER directed by Simon Langton and based on a novel written by John Hale That s an old idea but it gets a few new wrinkles in this mystery that is not so much a who done it as a what are they doing and why Bob Jones played by Nigel Havers is a Russian language translator for British intelligence That is still living in the light world but he gets occasional glimpses of what is going on in the dark world He is disturbed by what the Soviets are doing what the Americans are doing and what his own government is doing all under the cover of state security At the very least he wants to quit his job His father played by Michael Caine thinks he would be foolish to give up a good job in a world that doesn t seem to be crying for linguists But Bob wants to do more He wants to tell the world what sort of thing happens in the intelligence game to lift the veil on one small corner of the dark world And that could get people killed THE WHISTLE BLOWER isn t a great mystery nor does it seem much of a spy thriller nor does it really have a strong social comment But it does do a nice job of integrating all three with a sense of irony at times It meshes MISSING with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE If you think about it these shouldn t go so well together perhaps there is more to this film than meets the eye This is one of those films where what each person tries to do makes sense but the sum total is a knot of complexity Other familiar faces include John Gielgud James Fox and Gordon Jackson There is also a minor and perhaps unintentional in joke in the casting of Jackson s superior a face that will be familiar to people at all familiar with Jackson s career THE WHISTLE BLOWER is not a great film it s not a spell binding thriller and there is little in it you haven t seen before someplace but it does skillfully play off of Cold War paranoia Give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0162,My Life for Zarah Leander,1986,Cast Zarah Leander Paul Seiler Armand Margot Hielscher Rolf Hansen Douglas Sirk Michael Jary Bruno Balz Prof Rolf Kutschera Hans Weigel Harold Prince and Karl Schoenboeck Credits Director Producer Editor Director of Photography Sound Christian Blackwood Zarah Leander a Swedish born chanteuse actress who became popular in Germany during the reign of the Third Reich in the 1930s and 1940s is the subject of this fascinating documentary by Christian Blackwood The film presents the enigmatic and multi faceted personality of Zarah Leander through both archival footage as well as the eyes of an obsessive fan of hers Paul Seiler This dual approach keeps alive the memory of a famous figure from the past but the film s value in exploring the private motivations of Zarah Leander s fandom far exceeds its historical description of her stardom Zarah Leander had unique features that attracted the attention and adulation of many fans in Nazi Germany especially in the homosexual community of the time Her broad features husky physique and deep singing voice made her a much more masculine presence than Marlene Deitrich She starred in a series of melodramas that were revered by her fans both for her acting and her singing She was frightened of growing old and she repeatedly tried to stage comebacks by singing her old hits to the accompaniment of her husband on the piano The loss of her youthful beauty had unfortunately devastated her and her career and she could not understand why current audiences devoted their attentions elsewhere Blackwood depicts her rise and fall through numerous interviews with songwriters and directors who worked with her in the 1940s and 1950s He also shows footage from her films as well as concerts she gave after her fame declined Blackwood also presents interviews with Zarah Leander in which another aspect of her personality becomes apparent her complete lack of any political compunctions against working within the Nazi regime In one particularly telling scene she says that the adulation that she received from her fans was all that was important to her What her fans did the rest of the time she declares was none of her concern This uncompromising refusal to accept political realities undoubtedly was a factor in her decline as contemporary audiences were loathe to revere a figure so closely identified with the Nazi regime But at one time she was quite famous Her ability to fascinate her audience is shown in this film through Paul Seiler a homosexual and a fan who first heard Zarah Leander on Swiss radio in 1943 and finally met with her personally in 1955 He soon became her confidant and she became the super mother figure he craved to replace the loss of his mother in childhood Paul Seiler plastered his apartment walls with photographs and articles about her He would console her after a bad performance or critical review and he would follow her where ever her schedule demanded Her decline from fame and death in 1981 had a severe effect on him While attending an auction of clothing and other memorabilia associated with Zarah Leander he becomes outraged that other bidders consider the momentos of her life and career as little more than collectors items for their own aggrandizement Trying to come to terms with her demise he seeks out and talks with a male professional Zarah Leander impersonator named Armand who sings her songs in a nightclub act As the film ends with the Armand singing many of the songs we saw Leander sing earlier in the film the admiration evident in Paul Seiler s face justifies and gives meaning to the film s title Technically Blackwood does an acceptable job He found and inserted many segments from Zarah Leander s films and concert footage He also has tracked down and interviewed many people who knew Zarah Leander or were associated with her rise to stardom including Douglas Sirk who directed two of Leander s biggest hits TO NEW SHORES and LA HABANERA He uses freeze frames and photographs with good effectiveness in parts However one annoying problem occurs in parts of the film Blackwood shot interview footage of Zarah Leander transferred it to videotape and reshot it onto film as Paul Seiler watches the videotape on a television in his living room Blackwood does this to show us Paul Seiler s reactions to the footage in order to heighten our understanding of his devotion However the psychological effect is obscured by the loss of resolution and color Blackwood himself invites comparison in one or two instances when he zooms his camera into the television and then segues into the actual footage itself thereby eliminating the videotape step The small pallid image of Zarah Leander on the television set seems a much less likely object of obsession than her richer fuller image on direct film Blackwood should not have used videotape as an intermediate step In terms of its narrative the documentary does a good job in portraying the life and times of a star from the past However the more interesting aspect of the film examines the effect she had on her fans both past and present The structure of the film is such that we are initially introduced to the fact that Zarah Leander had and still has a loyal following This arouses a curiosity as who this Zarah Leander person is and why she has such a following Only after 30 minutes or so are we shown archival footage of her films and concerts to give us an understanding of exactly who is being discussed so reverently by her fans While portraying her decline and death the film constantly shifts its focus back to Paul Seiler He opens up to the camera considerably and in several very moving scenes explains his personal fondness for Zarah Leander His homosexuality her husky masculine features and the loss of his mother at an early age are all discussed with such candor and simplicity that the documentary is transformed into a very personal tribute and love letter to Zarah Leander In one particularly touching moment Paul Seiler tells how he was unable to give Zarah Leander a birthday gift of photographs and momentos of her career because she became more distant from him as she grew older and faded from stardom She stopped returning his calls and he was not allowed to see her as often as before The sadness in Paul Seiler s face as he recounts this turn of events humanizes the depth of his attachment to her and the pain of separation after her decline While we may not share his reverence for Zarah Leander we certainly come to understand just how deeply he loved her and why she exerted such an influence over him The film rates two and a half out of four stars for going beyond a mere historical representation of Zarah Leander s life However the real star is Christian Blackwood himself His ability as a film maker is apparent in this film and his work deserves wider recognition The insights presented with discerning perception by Christian Blackwood into why someone would devote his life to a masculine chanteuse actress who was closely identified with the Nazi Party is the real heart of the film Partial Filmography of Christian Blackwood Christian Blackwood s films have been shown at numerous film festivals and on international television winning many awards along the way His feature film SAN DOMINGO adapted from a novel by Kleist won the Bundesfilmpreis for 1970 the German Oscar award equivalent He has also made several commercials for television and cinema as well as short films that are not listed above
0163,Near Dark,1987,What is the nicest thing I can think of to say about NEAR DARK Well they didn t bend too much the traditional rules for vampires and within those rules they showed something of how dangerous a gang of really mean spirited bloody minded vampires might be Beyond that NEAR DARK is over three hours in a film so bad every minute of watching it counts as two minutes off your sentence A guy picks up a girl who turns out to be a vampire She bites him after what seems like and interminable period of time This opening sequence turns out to be the high point of the film Our friend is forced to join the gang of vampires to learn the trade of vampirism Mostly he sees how the vampires bully and terrorize humans with their powers The scenes of the bullying are long and violent and bloody and boring There are a couple of ideas borrowed from Anne Rice s INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE
0164,Dancers,1987,Let me start my saying that I love ballet adore the ABT company and like GISELLE enough that I was a Super in the ABT s Met performance of it last spring But I have never been enchanted by ballet on the screen either movies or TV I was however impressed by TURNING POINT Baryshnikov s debut film as it used the ballet to illustrate the lives of the Dancers Even WHITE NIGHTS used ballet well employing a very cinematic piece by Twyla Tharp to set the mood for the movie DANCERS uses the actors to illustrate GISELLE It doesn t work The point of the film seems to be to bring the story of Giselle s seduction and death up to date by showing a modern seduction by Baryshnikov s character who dances Albrecht in the ballet of a member of the chorus village in juxtaposition to her correct romance with a member of her own class a stagehand There is even an insane scene of both the Giselle like chorus member and Alessandrs Ferri dancing GISELLE on the stage very amateurly cut together There is a lot of GISELLE in the film Most of the better parts of the first act because it is meant to correspond to the current situation and much of Act II the Willis in the forest trying to dance the men to death because that s where the viruoso dancing is If you enjoy ballet on film like GISELLE worship Baryshnikov and don t mind the dance interrupted for close ups of his face then you will probably not resent paying 6 for this film One thing is absolutely certain Even the most die hard fan will hate this film when it hits the small screen Only its size saves it now
0165,Prayer for the Dying A,1987,I saw a preview of A PRAYER FOR THE DYING last night at Camera One in San Jose Now Camera One is one of those high falutin places that play movies like TAMPOPO WISH YOU WERE HERE and MY LIFE AS A DOG A PRAYER FOR THE DYING stars Bob Hoskins Alan Bates and Mickey Rourke Mickey Rourke is an IRA assassin who wants out Alan Bates is a funeral director who ll get him to the USA if he ll do one more job Bob Hoskins is a priest ex military man who witnesses the killing Here is my list of complaints Prescript I went into this movie with a good attitude 1 Mickey Rourke s accent is so inconsistent it s supposed to be Irish that it s nearly impossible to make out what he s saying 2 Once again Mickey Rourke plays the detached ultra hip cool guy just like in ANGEL HEART 9 1 2 WEEKS and YEAR OF THE DRAGON and it s getting boring 3 Not considering 2 Mickey Rourke can t act 4 There s no character development motivation suspense or mood 5 The music is unbearably overwrought 6 Alan Bates turns what could have been an extremely sinister character into high camp 7 Is Alan Bates wearing a wig and did he recently have facial surgery There is nothing above his collar that looks human 8 The movie can be broken down into a cycle of length 3 scenes which are supposed to be meaningful but are patently phony scenes which are high camp and scenes which are supposed to be hip It s a conspicuously bad mix 9 Bob Hoskins is totally wasted in a 0 dimensional role 10 For cheap sympathy there s a blind girl 11 The audience was a bunch of morons In one scene where the priest loses his temper and starts to beat up the funeral director s henchman it is clear that the priest is horrified by his return to violence During this scene the audience was cheering him on like he was Rambo In general even before it became obvious how bad the movie was there was an awful lot of inappropriate tittering There isn t a rating on the Sid and Nancy Leeper 4 4 or scale low enough to place this movie Postscript The only positive thing the person I went with could come up with was that the movie showed what a funeral director s job was like more than any other movie she d seen
0166,Someone to Watch Over Me,1987,In Brief Once again Ridley Scott takes a mediocre premise and by sheer force of technique almost makes you buy it Several appealing characters trapped in a movie of the week But still it s a Ridley Scott picture I ve developed a theory about Ridley Scott that mediocre material has an irresistible attraction for him I m not quite sure whether it s the challenge of transforming lead into gold or just that dross keeps your attention on his work But you consistently hear in reference to his pictures THE DUELLISTS ALIEN BLADE RUNNER LEGEND and now SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME how the movie itself wasn t much but IT LOOKED SOOOOO GOOD He does keep getting better though THE DUELLISTS was primarily eye candy but ALIEN had such compelling texture that it for some triumphed over its hoary old bug eyed monster plot BLADE RUNNER was his only unqualified success as far as I m concerned simply because its future world was so complete and also because to a large extent the creation of a compelling world was the movie LEGEND again leaned on world fabrication but its other elements were so vestigial that it didn t quite make it in spite of the brilliance of the odd moment and the fact that it was the most complete satisfying fantasy world I ve ever seen in a film And now SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME his first real world picture containing his first romance The story cop from Queens bodyguards socialite from Manhattan and gets in over his head romantically speaking Canonical movie of the week material right Indeed But then there s the part that s hard to talk about Somehow Ridley Scott has gone beyond look beyond mood beyond texture into some other realm entirely The images in the first twenty minutes or so of this movie are so ravishing so self assured so perfectly assembled so right that they almost justify the film on their own Unlike the perfect compositions of say Stanley Kubrick they draw you in They have an electric life of their own and they say to you Come here Let me show you something you ve seen a million times in a way you ve never thought possible Not that everything else in the film is wrong Tom Berenger is perfectly cast as and perfectly plays a basically simple hard working family loving confused but not stupid working class cop Both his wife and his love interest sorry didn t catch the names are distinct full blooded people You just wish and wish and wish they these interesting sympathetic people would jump the track of this basic predictable copshow and go do something interesting Ridley Scott is a state of the art filmmaker I just wish someone would force a state of the art script on him Let s start a movement to make him direct the film of PRESUMED INNOCENT For this one he only gets bbb out of bbbb
0167,Prince of Darkness,1987,Anyway I know all you John Carpenter fans have been waiting years now since THE THING for a real Carpenter horror flick Well PRINCE OF DARKNESS isn t it The premise of the rebirth of Satan on Earth is very badly set up with a lot of absurdly bad metaphysics and theology The horror and suspense are nil people stupidly wander off alone and you just know they re going to get it First you see them walking down the hall then all of a sudden somebody appears from the side of screen and stabs them breaks their neck or spits at them and then the scene is over this last part from the appearance of the second person to the end of the scene typically lasts 1 5 seconds By the way in case you re wondering Spits at them well that s supposed to be scary but as you can already tell just by reading about it it s so stupid you want to laugh every time it happens There is no gore whatsoever However if you re into disgusting things this movie might be for you There are a lot of shots of worms and bugs and maggots and all those fun things There s a nice long sequence in which one of the characters walks around with the worst skin affliction you ve ever seen And there s one really funny scene in which a man standing up is being eaten by zillions of bugs and his body parts start to fall off Actually a lot of the movie is so bad that it s funny Other comments the music never stops and it gets really annoying really fast the intro credits are interspersed with the beginning of the movie so that it takes about 10 minutes before they re all done with the acting is really lame most of the actors I recognized from TV series the worst being Donald Pleasance as a priest and finally this movie has the highest Asian count 3 among all movies I know of in which the characters races were irrelevant Rating 0 on 4 4 1 Cable on 1st view 2nd view and maybe 2 on S N
0168,Prince of Darkness,1987,Capsule review A very demanding and very rewarding horror film Horror and science fiction combine together to make a film for real long standing horror film fans only Lots of old stuff but a lot that even the long time fans have not seen before The last half hour is a let down but it is hard to imagine an ending fitting the buildup Rating 2 A lot of horror films are coming out about now Released in one weekend are both PRINCE OF DARKNESS and NIGHT FLYERS Earllier this year Clive Barker directed and wrote HELLRAISER BELIEVERS based on a respected horror novel came out this year Then there were a number of minor pieces of the NEAR DARK ilk Horror I understand sells well on videocassette so it is pretty tough for a horror film to lose money I was vaguely aware that the aforementioned PRINCE OF DARKNESS was from John Carpenter but he has had a spotty career I like his DARK STAR HALLOWEEN THE THING and maybe a few others His most recent BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA was a good idea that went amazingly bad But then things are not always what we expect PRINCE OF DARKNESS for example turns out to be the best thing that Carpenter has ever done It may well be the fantasy film I will want to remember from 1987 For 2000 years the Brotherhood of Sleep have kept secret what Christianity was really about have kept secret the true nature of evil and of the Devil a secret with roots far older than humanity Now 2000 years after they discovered the secret it is becoming important to understand it once more The laws of physics are changing and the focus of all that is happening is one small rundown church in Los Angeles There a group of scientists their graduate students and a priest are trying to unravel the mystery of what is happening And what is happening will tie together particle physics mathematics and orthodox Christianity PRINCE OF DARKNESS has everything it needs but the payoff The final third of the film is good Carpenter style suspense but it fails to live up to the promise of the first two thirds of the movie If it had this would have been an excellent science fiction film as well as a good horror film As it is PRINCE OF DARKNESS is rich in ideas and has some good suspense to boot but doesn t quite deliver I really enjoyed the film but have to give this film a qualified recommendation It takes a lot of effort just to understand as much of what is going on as the director wants to show you There are many scenes that are deliberately disturbing and a lot more that are violent though it has been pointed out to me that there is very little actual blood If you haven t seen many horror films you may not find this one worth your effort there are a lot of other good films out there If you have seen a lot of horror films you will recognize little ideas here and there from are you ready DRACULA THE EXORCIST THE THING THE QUIET EARTH THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH THE KEEP and THE TERMINATOR Yes there are recognizable ideas inspired by each of these yet there are so many new ideas in this horror film that the familiar ones are outnumbered The name of the man who crafted all these ideas into a single screenplay is Martin Quatermass Perhaps that is a pseudonym and even a film reference Since some of the images like the marauding street schizophrenics are reminiscent of images out of Carpenter s ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 it is at least conceivable that the film was written by Carpenter himself In any case it is often hard to follow exactly what is happening the film makes the audience work a little And a little knowledge of paradoxical 20th Century physics helps to set the atmosphere that s a remarkable statement all by itself If you are tired of seeing old ideas rehashed in horror films PRINCE OF DARKNESS will show you a lot you haven t seen before You people and me who wanted to see a horror film of power in Clive Barker s HELLRAISER sorry Barker didn t deliver but PRINCE OF DARKNESS is what you were expecting I d give it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale DISCLAIMER As might be obvious a film that audaciously plays with ideas will appeal to me more than to the viewing public at large A prime example is LIFEFORCE itself a film that gave a science fictional alternate interpretation to traditional beliefs
0169,Nightflyers,1987,Capsule review An incompetent adaptation of a mediocre novella add up to a must miss science fiction film Besides seeing how someone managed to turn an obviously inadequate special effects budget into an impressive set of effects this film has little going for it certainly not the characters Rating 1 I was recently discussing the new Star Trek series with some fans who were unhappy with it The series is certainly weak in ideas and my friends solution was to solicit stories from established science fiction writers I was somewhat doubtful that a good story in incompetent hands would stay good for very long I remember the disappointment of seeing DUNE I think another case in point of at least a fair story that did not fare well in the transition to screen is Nightflyers George R R Martin who is a pretty good writer wrote the novella on which the film was based Admittedly it is not his best work but it deserved a better shake than it got in this weak and boring adaptation The story deals with an expedition to a celestial phenomenon which may or may not be connected with a hypothetical alien race called the Volcryn The Nightflyer the craft for the expedition is piloted by a crew of one a mysterious young captain seen to the other members of the expedition only as a life sized hologram that can appear whenever and wherever he it wants Then mysterious things start happening and people start getting killed and the travelers suddenly have more to think about than an alien race Well that doesn t sound too bad That is all taken from Martin s novella and this adaptation is at least Hollywood s idea of faithful to the original story which is to say yeah much of the plot is there and the plot of the film is more like the source story than it is like any other story or film that comes to mind Any better than that and you start calling it a literal adaptation So the story is recognizably Martin s Nightflyers and I will say one more good thing for it it has cheap special effects done really well Someone very intelligently knows how to get 4 5 the quality of effect at 1 5 the cost For that and other reasons I was reminded more than once of DARK STAR But there is where my charitable feelings toward NIGHTFLYERS end abruptly I have rarely seen a bunch of characters I cared less about I started counting the number left alive the way I used to count the days left till summer vacation With the exception of the expedition cook the characters are developed pretty much by how they argue with each other The direction is nearly humorless and you watch through the whole film without them ever showing any personality at all The hero should be something like Ripley in ALIEN but instead she looks like a lawyer s wife who has just stepped out of the beauty parlor with her high heels her frosted lipstick and her big earrings The captain looks like a 1980s rock star complete with earring Much of the wardrobe and all of the hairstyles are from the late 1980s in spite of the 21st Century setting The science was laughable if they let the air out of the ship it would implode noisy smoking explosions in a vacuum that sort of thing The continuity was confusing and error ridden I know I would not want to fly a spaceship that uses burning torches and candles for lighting The film even picks up a major fault of the story the audience can figure out what is going on much faster than the people on the ship This is an amateur film which makes a lot of amateur mistakes Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0170,Suspect,1987,I caught SUSPECT at a sneak preview last night so I thought I d fire off my opinion I can t really describe it without giving away at least some of the plot so hit n now if you so choose This is a good movie SUSPECT is so much like NO WAY OUT it s a little annoying It s the same basic core plot A big Washington politico kills a young woman and tries to cover it up Lots of artsy District of Columbia location shots with the mandatory Watergate shot and lots of pretty monuments and imposing federal buildings The same feel for power in high places and the misconduct it may bring Although one might suspect that SUSPECT sorry was a direct rip off of the success of NO WAY OUT it s probably just a coincidence since most of the work on SUSPECT must have been completed by the time NO WAY OUT was released As much as I liked NO WAY OUT I think I like SUSPECT even better In NO WAY OUT the emphasis seemed to be on the convoluted plot line In SUSPECT the emphasis is on the characters And the characters work better Cher accomplishes an astounding performance as the public defender called in to defend a deaf and mute derelict accused of murder Her characterization of the overworked underpaid P D has never been done better She brings a tremendous amount of nervous energy into her character yet shows excellent subtleties and complexities I identified with her from the beginning I think she showed up Kevin Costner in NO WAY OUT Unfortunately Dennis Quaid as one of the jurors was disappointing His character does some incredibly bizarre and dangerous things and we never quite feel his motivation Actually he does have a motivation he s trying to get into Cher s pants At least that s all I could determine Early in the film we see that Quaid s character is a lobbyist for the dairy industry who will stoop to any sleazy methods to advance his cause There s potential for an interesting character there but Quaid keep his character weak About all he does is grin and smirk To this film s credit there are no sleazy sex scenes In fact there s no sex at all It was a very refreshing change to sit through a mainstream Hollywood film without the mandatory sex scene We see Quaid take a congresswoman to his apartment where they start to remove clothing but there s an immediate fadeout Quaid also visit s Cher s apartment and some kissing begins but the scene ends so quickly we don t know if it went beyond kissing or not That s it It made me think that the sex scenes in NO WAY OUT were just an added attraction that may have added little to the movie Sure they were some of the steamiest and best sex stuff Hollywood has produced in years but would NO WAY OUT have been a weaker film without them Probably not SUSPECT has excellent supporting work which I thought was a bit weak in NO WAY OUT Liam Neeson John Mahoney and Joe Mantegna did terrific jobs Sorry I can t match names with faces first date didn t want to stay for the credits The deaf mute derelict was good although a bit overdrawn in parts The hostile judge couldn t have been better and Cher s co worker should have had more screen time as should have the deaf mute derelict SUSPECT is sort of a hybrid film as it incorporates both the politcal thriller aspects and standard courtroom drama While NO WAY OUT was set in the back halls of America s intelligence community SUSPECT is set in our judicial system This makes SUSPECT a little more identifiable a little more understandable and makes the whole film flow like melted butter SUSPECT seems to be one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to deal with the homeless issue in any detail A lot more could have been said but at least this film shows us the tip of the iceberg After watching SUSPECT we are a tiny bit more aware that millions of perfectly normal Americans are living in cardboard boxes and eating out of dumpsters Some faults there s a overuse of the make the audience jump with a loud noise technique You expect this in a thriller but it happened at least a half dozen times often for no reason other than just to keep you jumpy And some of the scenes are too predictable You know the judge is going to kill himself when he takes out the shotgun You know that Cher is going to be attacked every time she s in some dark hallway SUSPECT s director Peter Yates deserves a lot of credit for keeping this one in line These political murder thrillers can get pretty hokey at times but SUSPECT moves like a Swiss watch Although the film is long about two hours it drags only in a few short spots Suspense levels are superior to those in NO WAY OUT The more I think about it the better I like this film and the worse NO WAY OUT looks I d give it three stars maybe three and a half For another perspective the person I was with thought SUSPECT was okay but not really all that good She felt the predictability factor was excessive enough to be very annoying I don t think she felt the suspense levels I did and wasn t as thrilled with the pacing as I was She did like the lack of the mandatory sex scene Of course she did say that NO WAY OUT was one of the best films I ve ever seen Michael Trout miket brspyr1

0171,No Mans Land,1987,Starring Charlie Sheen D B Sweeney Randy Quaid Written by Dick Wolf Music Score by Basil Poledouris Executive Producers Ron Howard and Tony Ganz Producers Joseph Stern and Dick Wolf Director Peter Werner The idea is a good one a young cop given a tricky undercover assignment finds it hard to separate the good guys from the bad guys in a world that s not black and white I haven t seen it done before but that doesn t mean it hasn t been done as I understand it the current television show WISEGUY has the same basic plot The question is how well have they dealt with it here D B Sweeney is the young cop from a nice family He is well liked although a bit naive He is also a good Porsche mechanic Randy Quaid thinks this makes him an ideal candidate to be the inside man in an investigation of a car theft ring that has already lead to a policeman being killed Charlie Sheen is the young charming and rich owner of the Porsche repair shop that is the front for the car theft ring He may also be the man that killed the policeman Unfortunately the plot moves predictably The young cop is seduced by the fancy lifestyle the charm of the Porsche shop owner and the fragile beauty of a young woman from the new life He questions whether he is after the wrong man The ending was telegraphed long before the final resolution I m afraid that the director Peter Werner who I am not familiar with was working with a story that needed some unusual twists Instead we are given cliches The charming owner just happens to have a beautiful sister who falls for the young mechanic Of course there is a bad cop A car chase And a rival car theft gang who are much less savory than the upstanding group who support the infiltrated ring Yet there are saving graces in this movie Werner has a nice feel for the bravado banter of young men living on the edge He captures the excitement and the danger of living in the fast lane and working on the wrong side of the line The tension in the scenes where the two young men are actually stealing the cars was almost palpable Even the obligatory car chase had moments of humor and yes subtlety The story moves swiftly sometimes too swiftly and maintains a reasonable level of excitement Also the characterizations are quite believable Sheen has just the proper edge as a jaded wealthy young man with too much freedom Sweeney not only looks the part but manages to act convincing as the young cop with divided loyalties Quaid gives to a small part a credible interpretation Overall the unoriginality of the story detracts from a stylish presentation leaving me no recourse but to give the film a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0172,Nightflyers,1987,You d think I d have learned after DUNE and 2010 that Hollywood is usually incapable of transforming a science fiction work to the screen without trashing it Still both DUNE and 2010 had their moments So when I read about a year back that George R R Martin s novella Nightflyers was being made into a movie I was awaiting it with some anticipation I needn t have bothered There are a number of liberties I expected would be taken with the novella For example Martin s heroine is a black very athletic woman though her being black was an incidental in her society so the casting of Mary Catherine Stewart was perhaps forgivable as were the name changes and the almost total disappearance of the enormously detailed background universe that gives a Martin story an extra enjoyment In fact in general I have no complaints with the casting the name changes or the illogical throwaway moving of the story s timeframe into the 21st Century But they ruined and bastardized the plot Even the massive amount of violence present in the novella while still here in large part is made completely gratuitous few of the violent events from the novella even happen And the subtle interplay of the characters personalities which made the novella so terrific is gone here The most glaring omission is the absence of the heroine s superior generic makeup though at least they didn t make her a screamer The special effects are poor by today s standards but if they had gone with the resources they had casting sets and all the producers could have made a credible film version of Nightflyers What they did make is celluloid trash And what they did to the Volcryn I ll be interested in seeing what people who aren t Martin fans think of this film I think it s poor by anyone s standards but I ve been a Martin fan for a long long time I give this film 0 5 stars out of 4 I d like to hear the story behind this film s scripting I hope Martin got a good deal for the rights because he couldn t have been involved afterwards By the way the main theme of the movie is a note for note steal of one of the themes from BLADE RUNNER If I were Vangelis I d sue but I don t think this turkey is going to make any money
0174,Manon des sources,1986,Just caught a local sneak preview yesterday of MANON OF THE SPRING the second part of JEAN DE FLORETTE I gave JEAN DE FLORETTE a favorable 3 stars out 4 review about a month ago and reported that it seemed to stand on its own even though it was the first part of a two part work In this it differs from MANON OF THE SPRING which I believe cannot be properly appreciated without having seen the first part I don t want to give away too much of the plot since it may spoil it for those who haven t seen JEAN DE FLORETTE but it is safe to report that MANON OF THE SPRING is the story of the revenge taken by the daughter of Jean on Papet and Ugolin which is to be expected by those who saw the first film The way in which this revenge unfolded was somewhat of a surprise at least to me although what was not a surprise was the way in which the second film clarifies the personal relationships that were only hinted at in the first film MANON OF THE SPRING moves more quickly than JEAN DE FLORETTE due to the larger number of locations and characters and the broader sweep of the plot which takes in the whole town unlike the first film which concentrated on the struggle over a single farm The acting and production are up to the high standards of the first film and if anything the portrayal of the dynamics of provincial village life in southern France between the wars is even better Again the characters are well rounded and well motivated even the nominal villains Ideally the best way to see this film is as a double feature with an intermission as I did last night Seeing MANON OF THE SPRING alone is less satisfying particularly if one has not seen JEAN DE FLORETTE For those who have seen JEAN DE FLORETTE however I give MANON OF THE SPRING the same three stars out of four
0175,Baby Boom,1987,By now you probably know the premise Diane Keaton plays J C Wiatt The Tiger Lady and a stereotyped yuppie marketing manager on the verge of being promoted to a partnership in her agency Then she inherits a baby from a distant relative Ignoring the suspension of disbelief inherent in the way the movie shows the adoption process J C ends up trying to be super Mom and still work 70 hours a week The plot turns on J C finding a clever way to deal with her situation There is also a romantic interest J C s live in lover having walked out once the baby came Unfortunately the ending is completely predictable by the middle of the movie though it s still handled well The pluses some very funny moments especially those centering on yuppie cliches e g J C learning about how important it is to get baby Elizabeth into the right pre school a nice conciousness of feminist values which includes some indication of men as nurturing parents as well and some nice scenery in Vermont The minuses the baby is just a little too sweet the plot is a little too pat Diane Keaton is far too unbelievable in her successful businesswoman persona unless you think that marketing executives stammer and giggle gee that s really great when a potential promotion is discussed and nobody in the cast had ever bothered to find out what a Vermont accent really sounds like Overall the plusses outweigh the minuses 3 stars
0176,Hombre mirando al sudeste,1986,One of the most universally praised films of the last year was MAN FACING SOUTHEAST With only two exceptions everyone I know who saw it lavished it with praise I finally caught up with it last Friday and I m spoiling for a fight with anyone who would care to defend it One of my two dissenters described it not kindly as a misbegotten hybrid of THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST I concur MAN FACING SOUTHEAST is indeed like an ill starred half breed but without the latter s mystical power or the former s sense of humor But seriously folks I have three serious gripes with it First it didn t have the dramatic fortitude to be consistent If Rantes was supposed to be this unfeeling creature why are we never informed or even hinted at about the transformation which enabled him to express such joy in the conducting scene He seems impassive when an Impassive Objective Analysis of Human Affairs is required and passionate human when that is convenient Second the film tries very hard and apparently successfully to give the impression of addressing important issues without ever really coming to grips with any of them Ambiguity and irresolution have their place in a well constructed plot but not in the kind of hit and run philosophical flirtation you find in this film Sure the doctor was intrigued engaged and depressed by encountering Rantes but was he any different at the end than at the beginning Did he learn anything If so then his treatment of the woman does a good job of obscuring it And how are we supposed to make of the prisoners rioting while Rantes conducts Is this supposed to matter to us except to jerk hope out of us like romantic novels jerk tears out of adolescents But I guess the thing that bothers me most involves the film s single clear philosophical statement that it is rational to help another which proves that people are irrational In fact compassion is one of the most noble of human emotions partly because it is irrational The most chillingly uncompassionate people I have ever met are also the most rational Tune in to libertarian discussions on Poli Sci sometime if you don t believe me The view that morality is a strictly rational phenomenon goes back to Kant and is profoundly dehumanizing making people into dry bearers of Absolute Good devoid of either passion or joy with no use whatsoever of the idea that humanity shares some common bond But of course the filmmakers didn t think it through that far They tell us that compassion is rational because it s an easy glib way of telling us how fucked up we are The annoying thing about MAN FACING SOUTHEAST is that it is perfectly content with glibness allowing and encouraging its audience in the smugness of frustrated hope without ever considering the effort involved in making real change in the world As H L Mencken said more or less If you make people think they re thinking they ll love you If you really make them think they ll hate you
0177,Fatal Beauty,1987,I try to avoid hyperbole when I review anything and most of the time it s pretty easy to do Most of the films I go to see are fairly close to the median thumbs up thumbs down line and then a few are memorably good Most rare though are the films that are so bad that I get angry that I am sitting and watching the drek Even worse is seeing a talented script or actor wasted by bumbling direction or a stupid plot But those are very rare They happen though I HATED FATAL BEAUTY The term mindless violence is a cliche that is used far too often when reviewing action films but it is totally appropriate here A undercover narcotics agent tracks down a couple of psychotic thugs passing out quick killing cocaine Lots of people get shot A mall gets destroyed MTV music in the background Well let s see black comedi an enne cop violence rock music BEVERLY HILLS COP Gosh I love a film where the marketing strategy is almost displayed in the opening credits Of course other films have risen above pedestrian plots They have good characters They have a good script They have good actors Well FATAL BEAUTY has a very good actress but I only know that because I saw THE COLOR PURPLE and JUMPIN JACK FLASH where she showed through some pedestrian material There is not a character in this film that I could stand much less like much less care about Goldberg s fellow cops are crude cruel Neanderthal bumpkins who appear to be there so that Whoopi can one up them with similar humorless comebacks Really this is thirteen year old dirty humor The plot is transparent The criminals are crazy but their familiar psychos And people change character like an on off switch There s a Beverly Hills mother who doesn t care that her kid got arrested and works at playing an incredible bitch for the first time she s on Then her son slits his wrists and bang concerned mother Whoopi says after the mother has supplied the name of the cocaine dealer who gave her the coke she gave her kid you re beautiful Right Got that Blech Script everything was telegraphed at least an hour ahead of time Acting should be changed to over acting even Whoopi her tale of why she hunts down drug dealers with such fervor is tacked into the last third to provide her 3 minutes of acting potential but to no avail I was so numbed by that time to notice even a glimmer of talent The clumsiness of the plot dominated everything And of course the pity is that Whoopi Goldberg can play interesting characters she can keep a lame script going She is one of the few actresses who seems to be given heroic action roles Great Now could someone PLEASE give said role a script that hasn t been produced by some PR research dweeb But she has to take some of the blame herself I cannot imagine how a film this bad could look good in script form This is by far and away the WORST film I have seen this year Even worse than that Australian horse picture I saw at the festival I would have walked out but it was the first part of a double feature Oh the following film seemed to be better but FATAL BEAUTY could make GILLIGAN S ISLAND look promising in comparison It was SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME a 30 s style love thrill story that Ridley Scott has reanimated wonderfully he is perhaps the only person alive who can still make New York look glamorous Good acting solid script and characters FANTASTIC music and cinematography A simple plot with a MAJOR stumbling block of a plot element something too large to enjoy but worth 3
0178,Slamdance,1987,This is a review for a movie that came and went in the San Jose area in one week about a month ago I didn t figure it would be of any use but then you can never tell when these bombs get dropped elsewhere around the country The name of the movie is SLAM DANCE and yes it s a stupid title and yes it was a stupid movie but not in the way the title might suggest i e it was not aimed at teenagers For background SLAM DANCE is by Wayne Wang who made DIM SUM and CHAN IS MISSING both good movies It stars Tom Hulce Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Virginia Madsen Harry Dean Stanton John Doe Adam Ant and Don Opper The music is by Mitchell Froom The basic storyline is that Hulce is a cartoonist either separated or divorced from his wife or ex wife Mastrantonio A woman Madsen with whom he recently had a sex mostly affair is found strangled and he is the prime suspect Stanton and Doe are investigating the case Opper is a thug involved in the murder Ant is a friend of Hulce s For those who might care the movie is set around Hollywood What the movie tries to be is a stylish non linear mystery It certainly succeeds in being stylish in fact to a fault as an excessive amount of time is spent on very cold beautiful shots of places and things that have nothing to do with the story It also succeeds in being non linear as clues are suggested but not fleshed out until much much much later when you ve forgotten about them already and details of Hulce s history and his involvement with Madsen are strewn throughout the movie completely out of sequence and without warning as to when those details occurred the past the far past or the present What it fails at is being a mystery Things happen for about an hour with no rhyme or reason then suddenly in the last half hour the plot seems to get going Hulce does some detective work to clear himself but the biggest most important clues he gets all come to him by unbelievable circumstances For instance one of the big clues is a business card that he finds in Opper s jacket pocket How does he find it Well you see after Opper beat him up he was so kind as to wrap his jacket around Hulce s shoulders I think most of the blame must go to those who set up the mood With all the glass and steel and plastic and fluorescent lighting you get to feeling so sick that you don t really care about your own life let alone Hulce s It s all kind of depressing but not in the same way as BLADE RUNNER It s like being trapped in an LA yuppie singles bar that you can t escape from Also a lot of the acting is downright bad Not so much that people act wooden though Doe certainly does don t tell me it s part of his persona it s that they act the wrong way nearly constantly For instance Hulce acts mildly irritated when he really should be acting thoroughly frightened And Opper first acts cold and brutal and then without warning or reason changes to fumbling and incompetent Stanton doesn t seem to be acting at all I think someone forgot to tell him this wasn t a readthrough Ant acts like an asshole probably because both he and his character are he manages to ruin the surrealists fish light bulb joke Mastrantonio is pretty good actually though she should stop playing these roles in which her main job is to worry about what happens to other people Madsen is good at her rather small role playing the ice princess but then that doesn t really take a lot of talent If you re wondering why I don t give it all around worst ratings it s because for a while the style is somewhat hypnotic There are quite a few extremely well composed shots
0179,Maurice,1987,Cast James Wilby Hugh Grant Rupert Graves Denholm Elliott Simon Callow Billie Whitelaw Ben Kingsley Judy Parfitt Phoebe Nicholls Mark Tandy Helena Mitchell Kitty Aldridge Patrick Godfrey Michael Jenn and Barry Foster There has been much discussion about the film MAURICE and reviews of it May I take this opportunity to give my opinions about MAURICE I would like to address both aspects of the quality of the film as a film itself and secondly as a film dealing with the very sensitive and important issue of homosexuality As a film MAURICE is a notable accomplishment especially as a followup to the major commercial and artistic success of A ROOM WITH A VIEW The producer director team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory did not let their previous success go to their head They set out to adapt Forster s novel to the screen and that is what they have done no more and no less Although their achievement in MAURICE does not equal their success in A ROOM WITH A VIEW the film is most certainly worth seeing There are many themes common to both MAURICE and A ROOM WITH A VIEW In both films the denial of physical and sensual pleasures that characterizes Edwardian society is portrayed as a major flaw in that society Marriage is depicted as a social contract an inhibiting force against the true expression of feelings and happiness Societal pressures to conform are intense Both films resolve the conflict with a gentle yet firm repudiation of the negative pressures society can impose on its members The fact that the lovers in MAURICE are of the same sex does not lessen the strength of their endearing and true love for each other Both films end with a reaffirmation of the common human bonding that transcends nationality class and societal expectations Instead of presenting their views as a polemic the films entertain and present thoughts for further contemplation There are differences too In A ROOM WITH A VIEW Lucy and George only risk their virtue whereas in MAURICE the lovers must risk being disgraced as well as being imprisoned In the first film the two lovers are re united while society and family give their blessing there is no doubt that the two will marry and live together happily In MAURICE there is a great deal of uncertainty as to the future although the joy of the present is clear when Maurice and Alec meet in the boathouse The two men clearly cannot marry legally and their relationship will in all probability be forced to continue hidden from public view While A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a humorous comedy of manners MAURICE is somewhat darker both in cinematic style and narrative tone My complaint with MAURICE is that in 135 minutes of screen time we only get to know the two of the three main characters with any significant depth The two are of course Maurice and Clive These two are portrayed very well and we learn a great deal about them and their motivations It is Alec that we don t know as much about We learn very little about who he is what his background is and why he loves Maurice as much as he does Just exactly why Alec climbs a ladder up to Maurice s bedroom apparently on a hunch is not immediately clear Alec and Maurice had exchanged nothing more than a few glances It s this sort of ambiguity that stops us from fully understanding Alec despite however hard we try The other characters the mothers Clive s wife sisters and the man who goes to jail for his homosexual activity sorry I don t remember his name are just there We don t know much about them and therefore we don t care as much about them They just take up screen time Most of the time they are incidental to the real narrative which is about the relationship of Clive with Maurice and Maurice with Alec Of course these relationships do not exist in a vacuum and therefore Merchant Ivory like any other film makers are forced to incorporate the supporting characters into the narrative Whereas this task of incorporation was accomplished with great success in A ROOM WITH A VIEW MAURICE fails to achieve the same results Maurice and Clive are convincing in their own depth but the other characters are not nearly as compelling This is the main flaw that prevents me from ranking MAURICE with A ROOM WITH A VIEW However I should note that my complaint has nothing to do with the fact that many and perhaps most of the dullest characters are women I do not have any compulsive need to have charming and intelligent women on the screen in order to make the film s depiction of male homosexuality palatable and acceptable To its inestimable credit the film does not take that easy escape route In fact it may be possible that Merchant Ivory deliberately de emphasized the supporting characters so that viewers would be forced to concentrate on the relationship between the main characters But that purpose could have been far better accomplished in many other ways My complaint is based on the rather unsuccessful portrayal and integration of Alec and the supporting characters period Whether those characters are male or female is irrelevant to my complaint So that s how I feel about MAURICE as a film per se But the very fact that the film has been made and distributed so widely is important in of itself The film does not exist solely as a film in a bubble of its own I can judge the film as a film but I would be negating the tremendous social value and importance of the film if I were to do only that While I can debate its merits as a film critic it is impossible to deny that I am a also member of the human race and a product of Western society MAURICE forces me to make that acknowledgement and to act on it rather than focus exclusively on my skills as a film reviewer I cannot forget the muted squeals of excitement and joy an elderly man sitting in front of me uttered whenever a love scene occurred between Maurice and Alec I don t know if that man was gay or not as I consider it rude and completely inappropriate to ask a total stranger about his sexual orientation But that man s emotions were just as genuine as Maurice s love for Clive and later Alec It was clear that he was overjoyed at seeing two men engaging in sensual acts in a major film released in the United States The power of MAURICE in that regard simply cannot be denied or denigrated As Mario Prats on the net so movingly wrote the film evokes the classic dilemma of being forced to subvert one s innermost desires for societal gain and acceptance The societal and religious pressures that Clive succumbs to are tremendously strong and still in existence today The simple act of seeing a positive depiction in a mainstream film of love and joy in a homosexual relationship is a powerful negation of incessant reminders and warnings from religious fundamentalists and society at large that homosexuality is considered immoral and wrong MAURICE succeeds in negating that pernicious societal view and it is that success which delighted that kindly old man MAURICE is not a great film but it is a good one If Alec s motivations had been more fully explored perhaps the full potential of the film s power to touch viewers with its humanity and sensitivity would have been realized And perhaps that would have helped even more to increase the number of individuals sympathetic to the lesbian and gay community Some members of that community may not want the help and or sympathy of the larger and therefore dominant heterosexual group But I would submit that we do have only one world to live in and I for one feel that a world based on mutual love understanding and tolerance is far more preferable than one based on fearful isolation and bitter divisions MAURICE is not a belated or reluctant attempt to welcome unobtrusive and docile gays and lesbians to society s living room of guarded acceptance Rather it is an affirmation a celebration an intelligent presentation of the strengths hopes fears desires and problems of homosexuals in Edwardian society and by extension our own society of today MAURICE has done its part to give the homosexual community the attention it deserves That great achievement coupled with its cinematic excellence makes it a very significant film and one well worth seeing Director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant created Merchant Ivory Productions way back in 1963 and the two have been making films together since James Ivory studied under and was influenced by the great Indian director Satyjit Ray Frequently they have collaborated with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala in the preparation of their scripts Merchant Ivory s films are known for viewing English society in a particularly picturesque manner Their most successful film so far has been last year s A ROOM WITH A VIEW which won Oscars for Best Art Direction Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay
0180,Nightflyers,1987,I read the George R R Martin novella last year and was looking forward to the movie He seemed to have taken the best ideas from ALIEN and 2001 and combined them with a drawing room murder mystery not the most original science fiction but great drama Unfortunately I couldn t even recognize his novella in NIGHTFLYERS Instead of interesting and different female characters we got three women who looked so much alike I couldn t figure out who was supposed to be whom all blond beautiful cheerleader types The male characters went to the other extreme with emphasis on physical differences giant black chef diminutive blond wimp rather than character The special effects seemed decently done I admit I wasn t concentrating but the logic of what occurred was absent I was too appalled at people without spacesuits conversing in a spaceship with the hull breached above them to notice whether the underpinnings were showing But it was the ambience of the movie that proved to be the most crushingly boring part Maybe we could call it spaghetti space opera It s that dark monotonous pacing that I associate with poorly dubbed Italian s f or horror movies the kind Commander USA features I began wishing for major faux pas so I could find something to enjoy in this picture Well there was one howler when a couple of women were trying to break into the ship s computer getting garbled machine language and one of them suggested Look for a menu This is the kind of film that gives science fiction a bad name I rate it 2 5 on a scale of 10 Don t even rent the video probably due next month Kimiye ihnp4 ulysses houxm clyde cpsc6a mtune moss ablnc kimi
0181,Cry Freedom,1987,Cast Denzel Washington Kevin Kline Penelope Wilton John Hargreaves Alex McCowen Kevin McNally Zakes Mokae Ian Richardson Josette Simon John Thaw Timothy West Miles Anderson Tommy Buson Jim Findlay Julian Glover Kate Hardie Alton Kumalo Louis Mahoney Mawa Makondo Joseph Marcel John Matshikiza Sophie Mgcina Wabei Siyolwe Gwen Watford Juanita Waterman Recently a reviewer for THE BOSTON PHOENIX a local arts and news weekly called the film MATEWAN an example of liberal Pavlovian movie making This is a far more apt label for CRY FREEDOM Sir Richard Attenborough s new film about Stephen Biko played by Denzel Washington the black South African student activist leader and his friendship with Donald Woods played by Kevin Kline a white South African newspaper editor who considered his own liberal views as his contribution to the reform of Apartheid CRY FREEDOM begins by showing Woods initial contact with Biko in 1975 and ends with the Woods family s escape from South Africa after Biko s death under mysterious circumstances while in police custody in 1977 Technically the film is thoroughly conventional Sir Richard himself has said that this was the easiest of his films to make There are inspired moments however The sound montage that accompanies a series of freeze frame images of a pre dawn police raid on a shantytown is quite effective as part of the film s opening sequence Flashbacks are sparingly used and the film is blessed with good performances from the major leads as well as the large number of supporting characters The widescreen composition and stereo sound are serviceable but they break no new ground George Fenton s and Jonas Gwanga s music is notable as is Sir Richard s expertise at directing large crowd scenes with as many as 15 000 extras The film s major flaw stems not from its production qualities but from the sacrifices under which Sir Richard made this film These sacrifices become especially apparent as the film progresses from its first half to its second Within its limitations as a major Hollywood film CRY FREEDOM works quite well but the very existence of its compromises prevents the film from completely fulfilling is avowed educational purpose The first half of the 155 minute long film focuses on the power of Biko s charismatic personality as Biko leads Woods to understand for the first time the harsh realities blacks face both as third class citizens and as banned persons The depth of Biko s confidence in the humanity of himself and his fellow blacks is demonstrated time and again as Biko refuses to succumb to the authorities provocations The genius of Stephen Biko is that even as he urges Woods and others to Drink up while relaxing in a bar in a black township he is able to point out the stark contrast between Woods opulent lifestyle and the poverty of of black shantytowns It is in eloquent scenes such as these where individuals and events in South Africa are allowed to speak for themselves that the film is at its greatest Unfortunately Biko s death comes almost exactly halfway through the film In order to make the film palatable to Westerners which is to say white audiences the second half of the film concentrates on the Woods family as they flee South Africa and the personal turmoil Biko s death has created for them The family eventually settled in England where Donald Woods published his two books BIKO and ASKING FOR TROUBLE on which the film is based There is no denying that Mr Woods and his family suffered greatly during their ordeal and their story deserves to be told as well The film however trivializes and cheapens their escape from South Africa by degenerating into an inane melodrama worthy of a made for TV movie The film goes so out of its way to help audiences identify with the Woods family that it becomes self apparent and almost begins to wallow in cheap sentimentality The film s most inexcusable moment comes when Mrs Woods and her five children pause during their flight to freedom at the white line on the bridge between South Africa and Lesotho Instead of hurrying over the bridge to safety they take one slow step over the line under a torrential downpour while Donald Woods waits for them at the Lesotho end of the bridge Efforts like this one to heighten suspense and drama fall flat because the Woods family did make it out and Donald Woods did write his books When the end result is known viewers can relax because they know subconsciously that the Woods family s current predicament will be resolved in their favor Furthermore the film is factually mistaken at a point where it most needs to be accurate The finale of the film quite stirring and moving in its own right wrenches the audience back to the horrors the Woods family escaped from by recreating the 1976 massacre of several hundred black students in Soweto who were protesting mandatory teaching of the Afrikaans language in schools This incident touched off rioting and protests and is an important part of the history of black struggle in South Africa The film shows the attacking policemen to be all white whereas in actuality many of them were black Sir Richard told The New York Times that he took cinematic license here so as not to confuse Western audiences away from the film s central reminder that Apartheid is an obscenity This simplification of complex political realities demonstrates the sort of compromises Sir Richard made in order to assure box office success It is exceedingly unfortunate that Sir Richard feels he must disguise his intelligence and sensitivity in order to bring his message to American audiences When Biko first meets Woods he makes a comment that he is about to begin the education of a white liberal These words describe the film exactly Conservatives like Jesse Helms and Jerry Falwell will deride the film and attempt to discredit it by calling attention to its few but significant deviations from journalistic accuracy Those who are already sympathetic to the issue of racism yet know little or nothing about the details of South Africa pass laws and other restrictions will find this a moving and distressing film This film will challenge them to seek ways to help dismantle Apartheid in whatever small way they can Those who have kept up with current events and know more about South Africa will find little new in the film Indeed some may even consider the liberal Pavlovian second half demeaning and insulting because of its typical Hollywood oversimplifications In spite of all this Sir Richard must be commended for creating the film in the first place His commitment against Apartheid was made clear when he refused to attend South African premieres of his previous film GANDHI in 1982 and his meetings with Winnie Mandela and other black leaders in 1984 gave him the background necessary to make a film such as CRY FREEDOM It is no exaggeration to say that Sir Richard is more qualified than any other director to make this film Sir Richard s humanity and conviction is unassailable Nevertheless given his stature and his avowed purpose to help educate people about Apartheid it is somewhat frustrating that his film has not carried the debate past its state last fall when both houses of Congress voted to override President Reagan s veto of a limited economic sanctions bill against South Africa The most notable accomplishment of CRY FREEDOM is its stirring portrayal of Stephen Biko and its effort to keep the issue of South Africa s racist policies alive in the news in Western countries For now that will have to be enough Directorial Filmography of Sir Richard Attenborough Sir Richard Attenborough is an actor producer director who has been involved with film since an early age He has acted in films such as THE GREAT ESCAPE 1963 DOCTOR DOOLITTLE 1967 DAVID COPPERFIELD 1969 and LOOT 1971 His films have been critically acclaimed especially A BRIDGE TOO FAR and GANDHI He won an Oscar for Best Director in 1982 for GANDHI He was knighted in 1976 and he won India s Padma Bhushan award and the Martin Luther King Peace Prize in 1983
0182,Matewan,1987,Capsule review A great propaganda film in the best traditions of Sergei Eisenstein An engrossing account of the birth pangs of the coal miners union in Matewan West Virginia as seen purely from the union s point of view Rating 2 Disclaimer No political intention should be inferred from this article I am addressing issues of filmmaking style only I think a lot of people were very surprised when REDS came out Warren Beatty had been in some okay films but he had never shown any great talent Then he made REDS and people realized that somewhere inside him there was a serious filmmaker with something to say John Sayles s track record has been only moderately better than Beatty s His films had been mostly low budget pieces usually with a social message Included are films like RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN LIANNA and BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET MATEWAN is very much Sayles s REDS It is a detailed historical piece done on a reasonable budget and it is a very moving film MATEWAN is the story of how the union came to the mines of West Virginia It is the story of open warfare between the miners and the company who had kept the miners in virtual slavery Each side has its general Leading the miners is Joe Kenehan an idealistic young union man with visions of a worldwide union Leading the fight for the company are Hickey and Griggs mercenaries brought in to put down the insurrection of mine workers and to get the mines turning a profit again There is a lot of history in MATEWAN but it does not detract one iota from the story telling But while in some ways MATEWAN is similar to REDS in some ways it is very different REDS was sympathetic to the socialists but showed them reasonably realistically warts and all Sayles instead was trying to make a perfect propaganda film and with some borrowing from masters like Eisenstein I think he has made it MATEWAN is the American equivalent of BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN In two and a half hours of film Joe Kenehan shows absolutely no faults at all He is intelligent considerate idealistic committed self sacrificing and courageous Hickey and Griggs show not one single virtue They are mean spirited rude lecherous impious selfish and they kill people Sayles is taking no chances that you might not know who are the good guys and who are not The miners are a little more human The whites start out bigotted against the blacks and Italians brought in to break the strike but Kenehan shows them that the only real fight is the union against the company and all the workers eventually come to love each other In BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN one of a group of jubilant revolutionaries yells Down with Jews only to be shouted down by others who understand the real fight You see almost nothing of characters who favor the company side other than Hickey and Griggs Sayles wants no possibility of them being humanized in any way In the climactic Battle on the Tracks they are simply brought off a train and seen at a distance without any humanizing close ups Characters who are humanized include the callow young boy innocent yet resourceful who was always anti company but who gets to see at close range just how despicable the company men are and in an almost too perfect substory he becomes a hero of the strike We also see others uncommitted at the beginning who are won over by the justice of the strike MATEWAN in its copious cinematic quoting from Eisenstein right down to the mourning of the dead scene undercuts its own credibility It is too perfect a propaganda film to be really trusted on its facts It is however a really fine propaganda film and does everything Eisenstein would have tried for It is moving and affecting It pulls all the right strings As such it is a pleasure to watch Rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0183,Running Man The,1987,In a future somewhere between MAX HEADROOM and ROBOCOP the number one television show is a gladiator fest where the contestants read victims are convicted criminals Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a cop who refuses to gun down unarmed citizens in a food riot and winds up in a labor camp framed as The Butcher of Bakersfield After a prison break and arrest he becomes the featured player on Richard Dawson s RUNNING MAN show Ratings go up as bad guys go down One after another government gladiators go after Arnie in the large game area and one after another he dispatches them So far I ve told you nothing you couldn t learn from the trailer and that s the problem with the movie THE RUNNING MAN is a film with motion picture ideas and television sensibilities Director Paul Michael Glaser formerly of Starsky and Hutch fame delivers numbingly endless action sequences and no direction for Arnold I ve maintained for a few years that Schwarzenegger is underrated as an actor To continue making that argument I m afraid I ll have to ignore this particular data point The man does have talent but he needs a decent script and a little help from the director or he comes off as a muscled mannequin I can t totally pan the movie because it does have its moments For a while I thought it would approach ROBOCOP s humor Soon though the formula of setup action wisecrack wears real thin The most redeeming feature aside from some deftly handled visual effects by SFX is the treatment of editing for TV news I can only hope that after seeing THE RUNNING MAN the audience approaches everything they hear and see from the news media with renewed suspicion I just suspect that the audience will be rather small and more interested in the action than the story But so was the director
0184,Someone to Watch Over Me,1987,I m sorry I waited this long to see SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME It s still in first run in some cities so it s not too late for you When Ridley Scott makes a movie you know that it s going to look good The man is simply magic with a camera I could go on and on about the rich atmosphere and stunning low key cinematography After ALIEN BLADE RUNNER and LEGEND he was worried about being type cast as a fantasy film maker With SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME he tells the story of a New York detective assigned to protect a socialite murder witness The story of the killer and his attempts to silence the rich woman is just a foundation for the real story It is a story about consequences The cop is happily married and in love with his wife He and the socialite fatigued and frightened fall for each other The movie deals with what happens to them and to the detective s wife and family skillfully interwoven with the thriller material The combination yields a rich film that like BLADE RUNNER I like better the more I think about it A few years ago I saw another movie with adultery as a central element UNTIL SEPTEMBER It s the only film I ve ever seen that made me angry I was furious with the story because worse than ignoring consequences it perverted them A truth about the human condition is that our decisions and actions have effects In UNTIL SEPTEMBER only the innocent were hurt and the adulterous couple breezed through the film making French toast and sniffing each other s armpits A refreshing contrast SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME not only illustrates how it could happen but documents the anguish and heartache of all the participants It is truly what I call an adult film See it while you can enjoy it on the big screen
0185,House of Games,1987,David Mamet is becoming a name to conjure with I first noticed him about a decade ago when he had a play on Broadway called THE WATER ENGINE That play set in 1939 wove together chain letters the World s Fair and the great American paranoia myth that the auto companies have an engine that runs on water but they ve hushed it up Much more recently Mamet wrote THE UNTOUCHABLES an enjoyable screenplay unencumbered by concern for historical accuracy HOUSE OF GAMES has a Mamet screenplay and Mamet also debuts as director Lindsay Crouse plays Margaret Ford a successful psychiatrist Dr Ford has doubts that she really can help any of her patients Against the cautious rules of psychiatry she gets involved in the personal life of one of her patients and in doing so meets Mike played by Joe Mantegna That is not saying much about the plot and my personal recommendation is to stay away from any reviewer who is going to tell you any more about the plot than that If you really want to know more about the plot to know if you will like the film take my word for it you will probably like HOUSE OF GAMES It has humor it has suspense and it had the audience spellbound My biggest complaint with HOUSE OF GAMES is that even when the final credits roll the audience is still waiting for the other shoe to fall No matter how many shoes fall in a film like this you still expect that there will be another one and another one And what further creates that feeling is that HOUSE OF GAMES is so entertaining it seems like a much shorter film than it really is Perhaps a plot twist or two predictable Lindsay Crouse s acting is a little wooden But Joe Mantegna is mesmerizing on the screen His is apiece of nearly perfect casting Siskel and Ebert both admitted to talking to the screen when they saw this film I m glad I didn t see it with them but I do remember grinning at the screen a few times I rate HOUSE OF GAMES a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0186,Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing,1987,I went to see I VE HEARD THE MERMAIDS SINGING partly because the trailer was amusing and partly because the reviews I d seen made it sound like a real feminist classic Unfortunately every amusing line in the movie is in the trailer and the only feminism exhibited is a demonstration that women can treat other women as badly as men do The movie is focused around Polly a Girl Friday Actually she s now a Person Friday which not only doesn t change the job doesn t make her any better at it Her life is neatly divided into work and her hobby of photography which she also isn t much good at One day the agency sends her to a new job at an art gallery and Polly falls in love with the gallery s curator Gabrielle There s some fine potential for mocking the pretensions of the arty crowd but most of the mockery is so heavy handed that it falls flat Gabrielle also has a lover Marie which should provide an opportunity for Polly to show some human emotions like jealousy But her adolescent hero worship she even spies on Gabrielle s private conversations with the help of the gallery security system is too shallow to permit her to do more than dream and fantasize Marie for her part rightly doesn t see Polly as much of a threat Unfortunately one gets no idea whatsoever of what Marie does think as she mostly follows Gabrielle around virtually silently Overall this is a dull movie about nasty manipulative people who are incapable of thinking about anyone other than themselves There s no reason to care about any of the characters least of all Polly in fact I spent much of the movie wanting to grab Polly by the shoulders and shake some common sense into her One star see the trailer and skip the movie
0187,Tampopo,1986,Imagine what would happen if Bill Forsyth and Julia Child had a son who lived in Japan The result might be something like TAMPOPO The basic story of this movie involves a truck driver who is determined to make the title heroine into a first rate noodle cook Interwoven with the plot are a series of sketches that involve food in various ways Most are funny like a very proper lady trying to teach a bunch of young women how to eat spaghetti without making noise while a man in the restaurant loudly slurps his pasta Some are erotic as the one in which a man and woman pass an egg yolk back and forth between their mouths Some are just weird at least to a Westerner but none fall flat The main plot is also quirky with lots of laughs In the pursuit of the perfect bowl of noodles Tampopo encounters a band of vagabond gourmets helps a choking victim by using a vacuum cleaner and cons a rival chef into revealing how long to leave the dough sitting The unexpected is constantly happening which is an all too neglected element in many recent comedies At a more serious level I also learned a lot about Japanese cultural values only in part associated with food The attention to detail associated with the preparation and eating of noodles is also a reflection of the attention to societal roles and this is lightly touched on in a few of the sketches Overall I can think of few better ways to spend an evening than going out for a sushi dinner followed by seeing this movie Four stars
0188,Sicilian The,1987,The King of Bad Movie Reviews returns with his fourth entry following A PRAYER FOR THE DYING SLAM DANCE and PRINCE OF DARKNESS I should have known to avoid THE SICILIAN since it was made by Michael Cimino of HEAVEN S GATE and YEAR OF THE DRAGON fame The story is about Salvatore Giuliano an Italian bandit in the 1930s who worked against the Church the Mafia and the ruling class to bring about land reform The only familiar face I can name is Christopher Lambert of SUBWAY HIGHLANDER and GREYSTOKE THE LEGEND OF TARZAN LORD OF THE APES fame The two biggest problems with the movie are the disjointed story telling and the wooden acting of Christopher Lambert in the lead role The events portrayed are very small and uninteresting and even together hardly serve to explain the motivations of the various characters And Mr Lambert s line reading is so machine like that the hero never comes across as a person When Giuliano is killed off no spoiler the movie opens and closes with this scene the only emotional reaction from the audience was the ecstatic realization that it was okay to go take a pee On top of this the music is unbelievably overwrought and the beautiful landscaping is completely wasted And there s not even anything unintentionally funny to laugh at
0189,Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,1987,Cross posted from soc culture indian SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID is the new movie from Hanif Kaureshi the maker of MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE Like that movie it is a social commentary on present day London seen through the eyes of Pakistani immigrants Sammy played by Ayub Khan Din and Rosie played by Claire Bloom are a somewhat unhappily married couple who are nevertheless very much in love with each other They are visited by Arif Sashi Kapoor now about 60 pounds overweight who has been powerful in the Pakistani government but is now running away from enemies The movie without giving the story away is about the time he spends in London The movie is powerful fast moving and disturbing The somewhat dramatised pictures of adultery poverty and social upheaval leave the viewer constantly off balance The contrasts between Arif s self righteousness and Rosie s ultra liberalism and their interplay with Sammy s philandering indifference to politics are interesting The movie does not stereotype though The other characters are just as interesting the sophisticated slum dweller Danny the pair of lesbian women one presumably Pakistani and the other black and Alice the proper Englishwoman who has waited for Arif for several decades The movie s title is controversial and misleading It is far more serious than it sounds and in fact at several points I thought the audience chuckled unnecessarily due to false expectations of a somewhat more humorous screenplay It is much more expensively produced than MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE and I thought somewhat less effective perhaps because it attempted more It is less a picture of the life of Pakistani immigrants in London than of the English underclass It is perhaps too gimmicky and too full of action I wished I had more time to think about what the movie was saying during the movie However Kaureshi has succeeded in making the viewpoint of the Indian subcontinent hip and interesting and must surely be counted as belonging to an important genre of 80 s film makers
0190,Sign o the Times,1987,SIGN O THE TIMES the new concert film from Prince has so much energy that I m surprised it can be screened in California without violating Nuclear Free Zone ordinances I m not a Prince fan per se I liked PURPLE RAIN but avoided UNDER THE CHERRY MOON and I don t often like what he s saying but I have to admit the kid knows how to put on a show His story instincts are good enough to have provided the barest thread of a story line to hold the film together and prevent it from being just a random collection of songs The Revolution has regrouped and recouped since Wendy and Lisa left and the new band is at least as good as it ever was Whatever they did to keep up the pace I hope it was legal The production values of the film are very high It was mildly disappointing that U Got The Look was printed up from video I guess they did the post production for that one on tape Everything else is well photographed in 35mm and tightly edited Prince has to be one of the most inconsistent song writers in the business His lyrics range from the near brilliant Sign O The Times to sheer dreck U Got The Look But I ve been somewhat fascinated for a while with Prince s aesthetic Look at the members of his band individually and you see a motley collection of Halloween dropouts Look at his band as a group and somehow it all fits together Maybe it s because they all wear more attitude than clothing I don t get it but I kinda like it I also kinda like his taste in women Okay okay I m only human Don t ask me why but I get a kick out of Cat Yes Cat At least Prince is out of V names for his protegees and her high frequency gyrations The big drum solo by Sheila E may well be worth the price of admission Her rap lick near the end of the film is an impressive demonstration of her near perfect sense of rhythm All of her stickwork proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the lady knows her way around a drum set Not bad as the icon laden minstrel himself says for a girl SIGN O THE TIMES is as I m about to say not bad for a concert film If you don t enjoy yourself it s probably because Prince is just plain not your cup of tea And congrats from the moderator of r a m r to Craig for having his name in the credits of two of the films in the 20TH INTERNATIONAL TOURNEE OF ANIMATION ecl
0191,Hope and Glory,1987,Capsule review John Boorman s reminiscences of childhood during the London Blitz form the basis of this unconventional but believable comedy This film is filled with memorable characters and a child s sense of wonder at the War Rating 2 There are lots of films made about World War II Some are idealized and just about any English language film made during the War was and some are more realistic There are at least some films made about the British home front but very very rare is the film that does not idealize You get this vision of a dedicated British people suffering bombs and bullets with an idealized British stiff upper lip Many seem inspired by MRS MINIVER John Boorman whose films usually are abstract and in the fantasy genre has turned out a realistic reminiscence of the WWII British home front which probably has more than a little autobiography HOPE AND GLORY is a child s eye view of the home front though we see what is happening with the understanding of an adult Very simply HOPE AND GLORY is the comedy drama of the Rohan family of five when Daddy enlists in the army and goes off to war The first scene of the film sums up the best of the film We see a weekend movie matinee audience at a theatre On the screen a somber newsreel talks about a worsening international situation that we know will soon lead to hostilities In the audience however war seems to have broken out already as screaming kids run around throw things at each other and generally have the high old time that kids always have if given half a chance Well the war does come but it still leaves the children that necessary half a chance This is was with a sense of wonder After each bombing the children joyfully run around to pick up souvenirs like shrapnel and shells Even the adults stare with childlike wonder as an errant barrage balloon almost as big as a house floats solemnly through the neighborhood capriciously damaging a chimney here or a roof there And in this world of the inanimate balloon seeming like a mischievous floating monster we see some of what could have inspired Boorman s love of fantasy Unfortunately partway through the film seems to lose some of its vision The story of the children gives way to to soap operish story of Young Bill s teenage sister The subplot of the sister drags the film down a bit but the mother s character is every bit as well drawn as young Bill s And in one sequence a prayer voiced under the mother s breath focuses the film and elevates her part from a portrayal of a hysterical mother to a tragic hero The film is at its best when it is about the mother or son in London When the film shifts away from London as it eventually does it loses its uniqueness But until that point it is nearly perfect Rate HOPE AND GLORY a high 2
0192,Nuts,1987,This is not an adolescent action film It is an adult courtroom drama Films about sanity have been popular topics from THE KING OF HEARTS to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST Streisand and Dreyfus star in this one with a cast of other well known actors and actresses and one unexpected appearance Karl Malden has an interesting role playing Streisand s step father Look for caricature drawings the Nose and American Express His character is pivotal but almost predictable in the film The drama centers around Streisand who is accused of manslaughter womanslaughter in her terms a la the ads This is not her felony trial but a hearing to determine sanity and competence to stand on such a trial Dreyfus is her count appointed lawyer after Streisand breaks the nose of her parent appointed lawyer Every character fears from this event that she just may be Nuts NUTS is about conduct and how individuals are expected to behave in our confusing society It is an appropriate film in an age considering drug testing and questions of sanity Two interesting scenes are 1 a scene between Streisand and Dreyfus regarding privacy and a need to know and 2 the cross examination of Streisand The film s real weaknesses are in the forms of flashbacks used to fill the audience in This is a performance film not so much a story There are elements of this film which remind the reviewer of Nicholson s ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST performance If this film had been made in the early 70s it might have had a different conclusion If you think you are the slightest bit crazy go see this film otherwise skip it B movie 90 minutes before I checked a watch I found it personally enjoyable
0194,Last Emperor The,1987,Capsule review Impressive biographical historical epic gives an emotionally uninvolving account of the life of Pu Yi the last emperor of China Bertolucci tells us about historical events he should show us and shows us sex scenes he should probably only tell us about But the sweep of history is certainly present and a great deal of change in China is obvious Rating 2 We in the United States feel we have grown used to change Change seems to come quickly and to virtually all aspects of life But in fact change does not come very fast to the United States and we do not take to change well The country that has seen the most change this century is in all probability China For millennia it had retained a feudal structure under the emperors China held firmly to its past as the rest of the world moved forward When it finally did let go of that past it snapped violently forward into the 20th Century In the span of a single lifetime it has gone from dynasties to the electronic age Even a shorter lifetime could have seen five very different forms of government And such a lifetime was the one lived by Pu Yi the last emperor of China THE LAST EMPEROR chronicles Pu Yi s life from the days the emperor ruled to the Republic to the days when the Japanese invaded and ruled Manchuria to the Communist revolutionary government and finally to the Cultural Revolution And each government uses Pu Yi without ever giving him any power He is always a puppet and each succeeding government merely seizes the strings from the previous one Each regime is portrayed in a bad light and each resurrects aspects of the days when the emperor ruled THE LAST EMPEROR is a big film an epic with a great deal of historical scope As such it is quite a good film but it is in some ways very flawed Bernardo Bertolucci somehow fails to breathe any life at all into his characters They are strangely uninvolving one is always displaced from them The characters are more ciphers than humans Just when we might be ready to empathize with Pu Yi he does something immature and nasty and suddenly we find ourselves not caring for him again THE LAST EMPEROR also panders a little taking more opportunities than necessary to shock us with scenes of breast feeding feces sniffing multi partner sex opium use and lesbianism Bertolucci underestimates his audience or at least me if he thinks that this sort of thing is what would interest them even if he finds historical documentation for it which I doubt
0195,Nuts,1987,Capsule review Courtroom drama asks the searching question should a downtrodden and wronged woman have to face the inevitable consequences of acting like a complete jerk Martin Ritt has made cogent films for great causes but if there is a great cause here somewhere someone will have to point it out to me Rating 0 Claudia Draper played by Barbra Streisand is fighting for her chance to be tried for manslaughter She believes herself to be competent to stand trial but two court appointed psychiatrists disagree They think that she is mentally unbalanced and when she breaks her attorney s nose in the court of law the judge is inclined to agree with the psychiatrists The court appoints Aaron Levinsky played by Richard Dreyfuss to defend Draper when her first attorney the one with the broken nose chooses for some reason to withdraw from the case Levinsky also finds that it is tough to deal with a woman who carries on her shoulder a chip the size of the Grand Cooley Dam Levinsky must prove at the pre trial hearing that this ravening enraged animal who is as likely to break his jaw as confer with him is actually a rational and mentally competent human NUTS was produced by Streisand herself She packed the film with more familiar stars than the film really needed Besides herself and Dreyfuss the film also features Maureen Stapleton Karl Malden Eli Wallach Robert Webber James Whitmore and Leslie Neilsen Ritt does his best to give each a chance to act but the film is too short to do that effectively But if Streisand s character has appeal in NUTS it is because we remember Streisand from other roles Though at the end of NUTS we may have some idea albeit trite of what went wrong in Claudia Draper s life we still don t know if she is crazy or stupid it has to be one or the other What is disappointing about NUTS is that after almost two hours of film I am not sure what this film was trying to say Director Martin Ritt s previous films have been really clear and cogent arguments His films include EDGE OF THE CITY HUD THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD THE GREAT WHITE HOPE SOUNDER CONRACK THE FRONT and NORMA RAE Most of those films have had something to say and they said it NUTS seems to be trying to say something but I have no idea what it is I cannot associate Claudia Draper with any cause I can put a name to other than the right to act stupidly and then escape the consequences On the other hand Eli Wallach plays one of the villains of the piece The audience certainly seemed to think he was a villain I can think of nothing he did wrong but oppose the sympathetic lead Other Ritt films have been manipulative but at least they have been so in good cause NUTS is manipulative and no place so obviously as in the postscript to this fiction film but not for any cause Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0196,Mitt liv som hund,1985,This is one of those statements that get me into trouble but I think that Bergman has given a sort of image to Swedish film that Swedish film might be better off without When people think of Swedish film what comes to mind is dry intellectual exercises with a lot of symbolism that if you could understand would only give you a multitude of reasons why the characters are depressed This may not be fair in general even of just Bergman films but it is the impression much of the public has gotten Friends of mine have to be coerced to go see even a subtitled film Well MY LIFE AS A DOG is subtitled but it is worth the effort to see and then some The main character a young boy is not having a very good childhood He is fatherless his mother is dying of tuberculosis and he gets into a lot of trouble mostly due to the coercion of other children But everybody knows he is a bad boy He doesn t fit in with other children or his family Finally he gets packed off to live with an uncle Suddenly everything clicks into place His uncle s family loves life and accepts people for what they are They are eccentric but likably so The eccentricity is done believably not exaggerated as the family was in Capra s YOU CAN T TAKE IT WITH YOU MY LIFE AS A DOG is not just a fine portrait of childhood and how children react to life s problems it is a comparison of philosophies of life The main character s mother wants to change him to make him a more convenient child to deal with The closer he is to the ideal of being seen and not heard the better The uncle s family accepts him as a human instead of a machine tooled component They revel in human diversity Under their influence he blooms as a human being rather than dwelling on morbid thoughts As a portrait of the world from a child s eyes a sort of child s testament MY LIFE AS A DOG is a better film than Bergman s FANNY AND ALEXANDER but is a cut below Boorman s HOPE AND GLORY Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0197,Planes Trains & Automobiles,1987,I saw PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES last night and left with mixed feelings about it On the surface it is one thing in reality something else and the dichotomy is not handled as well as it could be I think writer director John Hughes has made another attempt at a comedy with a serious underside but this time the two goals do not mesh as well as in past films Basically the plot concerns marketing exec Neil Page Steve Martin and his attempts to return home from a business trip just before Thanksgiving The trip starts awful and gets worse due to a combination of incredibly bad luck and the presence of Del Griffith John Candy Del is a sales rep and one of the single most boorish people on the face of the earth For the purpose of this trip he also seems to be an instrument of fate sent to accompany Neil through his trials and to have him examine his life and his relations with other people This is noble stuff but the movie doesn t always reach the level Hughes attempts The comedy side is quite good Hughes can direct a farce as well as anybody as he has shown in SIXTEEN CANDLES and FERRIS BUELLER S DAY OFF This time with Martin and Candy he has the additional benefit of two of the best comedic actors around Watching Martin go through surprise despair anger and resignation is like watching a master musician play his instrument And John Candy doing a character he has done variations of for years shows how an overbearing lout should be played The two form a comedy team that deserve more movies together But the drama Hughes strives for sometimes seems forced We are made to see the human side of Candy s cartoon character and the shift in perception is jarring Candy carries it off as well as I think that any actor could and in fact is the best that I have seen him But the script doesn t handle the transition in a natural way and the audience is left feeling manipulated Martin s character being less extreme is not subject to as many shifts but it is not always clear from where the attitude changes he does show come The whole idea of a farce is somewhat foreign to this type of introspection so maybe Hughes just tried something beyond him Still his teen comedies did a good job of making us laugh and think so maybe he just didn t do as good a job with this film Despite its problems I liked PLANES TRAINS and AUTOMOBILES I felt empathy with the characters and even if I didn t know where much of the characters emotion came from I responded to it I also laughed a lot It s tough to complain about a film which does that I d give it a 1 on the 4 4 scale
0198,Cry Freedom,1987,The latest in a cycle of social conscience films from director Richard Attenborough CRY FREEDOM succeeds well in translating and interpreting a foreign land a foreign culture and a struggle for redemption in a system which offers little hope for nine tenths of its population Depicting the fight against the repressive Apartheid system in South Africa CRY FREEDOM slowly informs its audience just as activist Steve Biko gradually educates liberal white editor Donald Woods to the reality of the system which supports him Woods in odious luxury This is a powerful film of contrasts of black and white of luxury and grinding poverty of brilliant sunshine and dank chambers of torture Attenborough s direction is evident but never overwhelming He lets the characters and events tell their own story Woods and his wife were consultants to the film so we are assured of veracity Contemporary press accounts of Biko s murder by the South African security forces in 1977 and the subsequent callousness and cover up made much of his unique qualities as a leader of black consciousness his physical strength his charisma his maturity Not all of this came across clearly in Denzel Washington s portrayal of a challenging role In a sense this doesn t detract from the film at all The fight against racism against repression against hatred must take place in all lands and societies In South Africa in particular this struggle is much bigger than one man alone This is one of the very few films I have seen in which the audience did not stampede for the exits just as soon as the closing credits began to roll rather they remained seated stunned by the enormity of what had just been witnessed What permits such wickedness to continue in the twentieth century was the unasked question on every lip The answer of course lies in our own hearts If you view the cinema primarily as a medium of light entertainment then this film is not for you If you also appreciate the wider context of education of politics of brutal reality and of artistry in film making then you simply should not miss this tour de force
0199,Street Trash,1987,First I have to mention a disclaimer The budget of this gem is low The acting is poor The characters are unsympathetic to put it mildly The script is mediocre All in all the technical quality is uniformly poor Fortunately this is not why one would go see this movie The basic premiss of this movie is that there is a case of tainted liquor going around which is killing bums who buy or steal the stuff Tainted in the sense that syphilis is mildly unpleasant The effect of this potent drink is that it causes people to melt in a multi colored and truly spectacular way But since there is only a limited supply of the stuff the writers have the bums mutilate each other to fill time The violence is so explicit and thorough that it was personally surprising that it was not released with an X rating I guess it was a small release and slipped through Despite the violence I found myself laughing loudly quite a lot Only once in a while does a flick of this magnitude wander along Other comparable titles are ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE I indeed feel fortunate for having seen it before it slipped away I m sorry I have no more information other than the title and it will be gone before long so seek it out

Editor Ron Davis Original Music Composed Arranged and Conducted by Peter Martin Art Director Don Dossett John Boorman The name brings back some of his great thrillers from the past POINT BLANK DELIVERANCE EXCALIBUR The last thing one would expect from a director of such grand mythic adventures would be a cheerful humorous and quirky recreation of childhood memories of London during World War II And yet that s exactly what John Boorman has done with HOPE AND GLORY It s a delightful film that is thoroughly entertaining because it draws richly and quite paradoxically from its seemingly serious subject matter The question that underlies most of HOPE AND GLORY is how to respond to periods of great despair and tribulation One can take refuge in the banalities of housecleaning like Tevye s wife in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF one can retreat behind a self created emotional wall like Pink in PINK FLOYD THE WALL or one can respond in any of a multitude of other ways War is perhaps the worse creator of misery and it directly invokes the question of how the human spirit survives its pressures Many films have depicted the horror of war as well as grand myths of heroic efforts and noble sacrifices of soldiers who fought them War has also been examined from a child s perspective in great films such as FORBIDDEN GAMES and THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS Boorman s film transcends all of them through its casual debunking of the sentimental myths surrounding war torn England in its darkest hour But while all the other films focused on the tragedy of war Boorman shows the comedy of it The beauty of HOPE AND GLORY is that its satire is so deeply submerged beneath the film s truly funny and nostalgic story that it is unapparent on casual viewing That sort of subtlety is rare in current cinema and is what makes HOPE AND GLORY a true classic The film is about 7 year old Billy Rohan Sebastian Rice Edwards in his acting debut and his family as they weather nightly bomb runs of the Luftwaffe The very first night of the bombing Billy and his 16 year old sister Dawn Sammi Davis rush out surprisingly enough to dance in their front yard under the bomb flashes The next day Billy begins his prized shrapnel collection as he makes his way to school At school he and his younger sister Sue Geraldine Muir are bombarded with patriotic songs and speeches from the schoolteachers who are every bit as nasty as the teachers in PINK FLOYD THE WALL and indeed portions of Billy s neighborhood resemble the Alien Landscape in which young Pink wanders But the overpowering tyranny that Pink succumbs to in that film simply bounces off the youthful resiliency of Billy and Sue even when they are forced to recite multiplication tables while wearing gas masks in a shelter during an air raid Their response to the war in general is very much like that of many MIT students last year when Hurricane Gloria brushed Boston If it causes damage I can t do anything about it so let s have fun Billy joins a new gang he s initiated into it by learning new swear words which rummages inside the ruins of bombed houses smashing already broken windows and furniture When Dawn hears Neville Chamberlain s announcement of war on the radio she exclaims that the war isn t her fault and that she still needs her stockings that she s looking for Their attitude is not one of crass materialistic infatuation but one of focus on the immediate relevancy of the here and now The war simply gives Billy and the other kids new games and toys to play with as they go on living life their own way Danger is present everywhere around them yet they recognize it and absorb it in a uniquely childlike manner which few if any of the adults possess Nonetheless the characterizations of the adults is just as rich as that of the children The entire film is a three dimensional portrait of Billy s family and each character s screentime is used to the fullest Billy s mother Grace his father Clive his three aunts his Grandma and grandfather George are all fully developed human characters and there is not a single bad performance among the actors who portray them More importantly they all are seen through Billy s eyes as he remembers them which means that he sees individual eccentricities that he and therefore the audience finds most interesting It s difficult to forget Billy s expression of disgust at being repeatedly kissed on the cheek by his mother and aunts or his toothy grin as he playfully tells his grandfather who had just completely missed shooting a field rat that the rat was limping as it walked away It is because the characters and plot develop through seemingly banal scenes as these that the film is so disarming Savage insults worthy of Luis Bunuel or Jonathan Swift are completely absent In their place is a much more gentle and smooth story that depends as much on what is not shown as well as the scenes that are The nonstop comedic moments tend to make even that sub satire virtually unnoticeable and yet it is there for those who wish to see it One particularly good example of that sub satire occurs early in the first half of the film which concentrates on Billy and his family s reactions to the initial declaration of war Billy s father Clive David Hayman interrupts his horsing around with Billy to reveal that he has joined the military After his announcement he motions for Billy to lean towards him so he can convey an important message At this moment the audience inwardly groans because it expects a tiresome speech from Clive about how Billy is now going to be the man in the house how Billy must now grow up and shoulder more responsibility But no that s not what Clive does at all He instead teaches Billy how to throw a googly to confuse the batter in a game of cricket and he conveys it as a family secret Although this is one of the more obvious moments the film is rife with similar instances where Boorman twists conventional expectations such that the comedic results can be interpreted to whatever depth the viewer chooses The deeper levels of anti heroism are there but the shallower strata of simple action and humor provide more than sufficient satisfaction Billy s grandfather George Ian Bannen dominates the film s second half and rightly so because he becomes the most influential person in Billy s life after an ordinary fire of all things burns down Billy s house forcing the Rohans to move to George s riverside country home far from the turmoil of London Although he continually comes across as a cantankerous semi senile old man he is first seen early in the film drunkenly toasting all the women he s ever slept with his humanity shines through after Billy s old school is destroyed by a stray bomb George and Billy laugh all the way back to the countryside gleeful at Billy s respite from school George begins to spend a great deal of time with Billy teaching him how to row playing cricket with him and telling stories Billy is far more endeared to his grandfather s piqued muttering and mean jokes than his aunts romanticizing or his sister s tears when her newly found Canadian lover is stationed elsewhere Although the film s sharp division between the males and the females would be considered sexist today the film doesn t harp on that because it s not a political film Boorman simply portrays idyllic country life as he remembers it complete with beautiful and lushly green scenery that belies the urgency and tension usually associated with war Ian Bannen s performance as George is so magnificent that George s personality overpowers and disarms whatever notions the audience takes with it inside the theater Much like the crusty old men in TRAVELLING NORTH Leo McKern and A MIDSUMMER S NIGHT SEX COMEDY Max Von Sydow George and his saucy ways are forgivable especially since the film portrays him not from any current context but as Billy sees him with his childlike perspective of 1940s England That perspective is well depicted through superb technical production values In one of many similar strokes of genius the film s editing by Ian Crafford conveys Billy s feelings to the audience by depicting the Rohan s burning house for what seems an eternity yet only showing the bombed school building for a few fleeting seconds The creation of the Rohans residence and street by Production Designer Anthony Pratt and Art Director Don Dossett is thoroughly convincing and Phillippe Rousselot s camerawork demonstrates a perceptive and guiding intelligence especially when the camera pans in very tightly on the small toy soldiers Billy plays with on his front lawn making the green grass seem almost like a jungle and the figurines somehow mythically alive And later in the film when a barrage balloon breaks free the camera lovingly makes it seem a joyful and wonderous event rather than the accidental mishap it actually is With the exception of some extremely sappy music by Peter Martin each individual technical detail the costumes lighting hair styles etc coalesce together so well that the crew s work seems completely natural and at ease with themselves the actors and the audience And in that fusion one must not forget the unifying hand of John Boorman Children have an uncanny ability to see events unhindered by social and cultural baggage to see their immediate importance and Boorman s film captures that beautifully from the wonder and the pity to the tears and humor The children are not cute little tykes completely oblivious to their surroundings like the small children in Juzo Itami s THE FUNERAL Billy and the other children in HOPE AND GLORY are perceptive enough to see the effects of the war but they are go happy enough not to be too bothered by it The depth of Boorman s portrayal of these children as well as the other characters is one that can only come from cherished and heartfelt personal memories HOPE AND GLORY is Boorman s second film that he has written produced and directed the first was ZARDOZ This time the results of his efforts represent the maturation of his filmmaking abilities the extension and completion of John Boorman as film director and auteur HOPE AND GLORY is his personal masterpiece and film historians will no doubt add it to the list of films that achieve near artistic perfection through their subtlety insight and multi layered depth films like ANNIE HALL THE SEVEN SAMURAI RULES OF THE GAME and THE GENERAL For filmgoers now however it is a sheer joy to see Boorman s work on the screen with all its humor and intelligence
0202,Anna,1987,Cast Sally Kirkland Robert Fields Paulina Porizkova Gibby Brand John Robert Tillotson Julianne Gilliam Joe Aufiery Lance Davis Deirdre O Connell Ruth Maleczech Holly Villaire Shirl Bernheim Rene Coleman Gabriella Farrar Jordana Levine Rosalia Traina Maggie Wagner Charles Randall Mimi Wedell Larry Pine Lola Pashalinkski Stefan Schnabel Steven Gilborn Rand Stone Geena Goodwin David Ellis Brian Kohn Caroline Aaron Vasek Simek Paul Leski Larry Attile and Sofia Coppola Credits Director Yurek Bogayevicz Producers Zanne Devine and Yurek Bogayevicz Executive Producers Julianne Gilliam and Deirdre Gainor Screenplay by Agnieszka Holland Story by Yurek Bogayevicz and Agnieszka Holland Original score composed and performed by Greg Hawkes Production Manager Associate Producer Brenda Goodman Costume Designer Hali Breindel Production Designer Lester Cohen Editor Julie Sloane Director of Photography Bobby Bukowski Art Director Daniel Talpers Sound William Sarokin From Polish director Yurek Bogayevicz and writer Agnieszka Holland comes this film featuring a powerhouse performance by actress Sally Kirkland in several scenes of deep psychological intensity Although the plot which resembles the story of Joseph L Mankiewicz s 1950 classic ALL ABOUT EVE leaves much to be desired Sally Kirkland certainly deserves recognition for her superb acting in what is perhaps the best female lead role so far this year Anna played by Sally Kirkland used to be a well known and successful actress in her native Czechoslovakia before she was permanently exiled for her outspokenness against the 1968 Soviet invasion The loss of her family homeland youthful beauty and career in rapid succession took its emotional toll leaving Anna ill prepared to cope with her fall from great stardom to relative obscurity as another unknown hopeful actress in New York The only bright spot in her life comes from the persona of Krystyna played by the beautiful fashion model Paulina Porizkova a young Czechoslovakian woman who immigrates to the US to meet Anna her star and idol Touched by Krystyna s innocence and naivete Anna takes Krystyna under her wing and helps Krystyna adjust to life in America both as a foreigner and struggling actress It is when the film concentrates on Anna and Krystyna that it is at its best One scene in particular where Anna movingly recounts the loss of her baby due to harsh prison conditions in Czechoslovakia stands out as being extremely effective As Anna and Krystyna lie on their bed late at night the camera slowly pans in one smooth movement from the bedroom door to focus on their faces No sound except Anna s emotion laden whisper is heard as she relates her life story The lighting is unobtrusively low key Anna and Krystyna lie almost motionless throughout the scene with the reverie finally being broken as Krystyna stirs This scene integrates the power of the spoken word with the language of cinema so well that it achieves an Ingmar Bergmanesque quality rarely seen in recent films The initial relationship between Anna and Krystyna is the highlight of the film That period of deep friendship lasts until Krystyna borrows her most intimate sorrows during a talk show interview Anna feeling betrayed and outraged throws out Krystyna and her belongings from her apartment Krystyna continues to advance in her acting career while Anna falls deeper into a mental morass losing her job as an understudy for an Off Off Broadway production as well as her occasional lover Daniel played by Robert Fields who leaves her for Krystyna s glamorous beauty Anna s mind snaps under the strain leading to the climax of the film The full potential of the narrative premise outlined above is undermined however by heavy handed efforts to explain Anna s mental collapse In the course of 100 minutes the film encompasses issues of divorce betrayal attempted murder a stillborn birth cutoff from childhood roots failure in one s lifetime dreams and aspirations and a few others thrown in for good measure Each one is individually believable and treated well but as each one is introduced the narrative increasingly resembles the histrionic plotline common to soap operas Every single character in this film is so laden with problems that initial sympathy for them simply withers away as the film progresses despite the autobiographical elements of Holland s script see below The best that can be said for the ending is that at least it avoids an easy or happy resolution which would have made the film downright ludicrous To make matters worse director Bogayevicz employs well worn cliches such as sudden rainfalls and the melt down of film celluloid with Anna s picture being burned no less as well as visual punctuation to drive home Anna s psychological despair At one point even an elevator Anna is using is shown from above as it descends into the darkness far below The striking intensity of the film s opening moments dissipates as the film progresses leaving a feeling of squandered opportunity Bogayevicz s prior experience with theater shows through but it is mostly out of place in this film The scenes that take place on a theater stage are directed well but Bogayevicz s overall visual style exacerbates an already overbearing script rather than smoothing over the film s rougher moments And Paulina Porizkova is disappointing as well Her role itself basically is one of standing prettily while the camera focuses on her much like her previous job as fashion model Even the film she is shown making as Krystyna near the end of ANNA is one where she walks around on a beach in a bikini Instead of solidly presenting her acting talents her film debut prevents judgement either way as to whether or not she will fail as an actress like so many fashion models before her Better roles than this one must come in order to demonstrate whatever abilities she may possess ANNA is the first film by Bogayevicz and Holland together and it shows promise for their efforts in the future as the film does have occasional moments of vision that shine through For now Sally Kirkland s performance is the most notable attraction in this film especially in a scene near the beginning when the anguish in her face at having to prove herself yet once again to another casting director s assistant is palpable and unmistakable The strength of Sally Kirkland s performance apparent in this and many other scenes never falters throughout the course of the film Her work over the past 25 years has failed to gain public recognition despite roles opposite Robert Redford in THE STING Gene Hackman in BITE THE BULLET and Barbra Streisand in THE WAY WE WERE and A STAR IS BORN as well as theater work with Andy Warhol Tom O Horgan and Robert DeNiro Her lead performance in ANNA would be one of the few truly deserved Best Actress nominations in recent years Previous work of Yurek Bogayevicz and Agnieszka Holland As noted above this is Bogayevicz s debut as film director Having enrolled at the acclaimed Academy of Theatre Arts in Warsaw he worked in Polish theater for many years Upon moving to the United States and eventually settling in Los Angeles his work as producer and director of Bertold Brecht s The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui won many major Los Angeles theater critics awards including being named Director of the Year by The Los Angeles Times and Dramalogue Agnieszka Holland was also born in Poland She studied film in Prague with Milos Forman and Ivan Passer Returning to Poland in 1972 after being imprisoned by Czech authorities in 1970 during the aftermath of the Soviet invasion she directed many films including STORY OF A BOMB winner of the 1981 Gdansk Film Festival A LONLEY WOMAN and ANGRY HARVEST which was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1985 She has also collaborated with noted director Andrzej Wadja on numerous screenplays She is currently directing TO KILL A PRIEST starring Ed Harris as the Reverend Jerzy Popieluszko a popular pro Solidarity priest who was murdered in Poland in 1984 It will be released by Columbia Pictures next year
0203,Running Man The,1987,One of the cuter bits on the new SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE is the movie reviewer who always gets the kind of movie she was at mixed up I saw OUT OF AFRICA and just didn t find it funny Where was the slapstick that I expected and stuff like that I bring this up to point out that when I go to a movie my expectations are usually pretty realistic I don t go to a musical expecting a well constructed plot I don t go to John Hughes teenage movies expecting reality and I don t go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies expecting to see great acting although it is a sad state of affairs that Richard Burton dead acts better then Mr Schwarzenegger does alive So as you go through this review bear in mind that yes Your Honor I knew what I was getting into and it is on that level that I didn t like the movie THE RUNNING MAN fails because it takes itself too seriously It is set in the future An evil government has taken over the United States and indeed most of the world They control the masses via their television and other mind control and propaganda methods Mr Schwarzenegger is a poor schnook policeman actually who refuses to gun down some civilians who are rioting and is then framed for their murder anyway He is sentenced to a prison camp why they don t kill him if he is such an enemy of the people I don t know and attracts the attention of the emcee of the most popular TV show on the air a drum roll please THE RUNNING MAN where convicts get to run for friends pursued by crack trackers The emcee is played by Richard Dawson who has the time of his life and was a delight to watch Dawson s character is the only one in the movie that seems to be well thought out and consistent Mr Schwarzenegger ends up on the show and well you can take it from there easily My complaints are major lapses in logic our hero refuses to kill one man because I can t kill an unarmed man and then the next time he disarms one of his stalkers seems to change his mind a strange cast and poor writing There are women and children in the crowd I refuse to shoot them George S Kaufman it s not Even Mr Schwarzenegger s famous one liners fell flat for me When I was a kid M A N Y moons ago my father had the Tom Lehrer album That was the Year that Was and he would play it all the time I listened to the album and saw where the grownups laughed and liked to use the lines A 7 year old saying Base 8 is like base 10 really If you re missing two fingers got a laugh but not as big a one as Tom Lehrer got because I didn t know what I was talking about There are those that are kind enough to point out that they feel I still don t But I digress The same is true of Mr Schwarzenegger and his one liners They are cute but seem wrong coming from him They are not said with humor feeling or conviction They sounded a hell of a lot better when we talked about them than when I saw it Anyway on the monetary scale of rating movies I rate this a see it on HBO since it would be for free anyway one of my lowest rankings If you want to see an action movie which is fun because it doesn t take itself too seriously and is therefore enjoyable catch LETHAL WEAPON now available on videotape or EXTREME PREJUDICE both excellent movies of this type As for Mr S I ve got a lot of respect for you as a body builder and a businessman but don t give up the day job
0204,Planes Trains & Automobiles,1987,Capsule review Pleasant compilation of all the holiday travel horror stories that fit into a short 93 minutes Two very opposite travelers played by Steve Martin and John Candy are repeatedly thrown together by fate and finally by choice John Hughes can handle comedy about adults almost as well as comedy about teens Rating 1 Mention John Hughes s name and most people think of films about teenagers Most are light comedies that hide perceptive character studies SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB are among his better efforts FERRIS BUELLER S DAY OFF was fair and WEIRD SCIENCE well even Frank Capra made occasional duds PLANES TRAINS AUTOMOBILES is about people who are at least technically adults But for that fact it bears all the hallmarks of Hughes s earlier work Neal Page played by a somewhat subdued Steve Martin wants to do something very simple he wants to go from New York City to Chicago He is leaving the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and he expects in hours to be with his family in Chicago It will be hours and hours and hours Page is about to discover everything that can possibly go wrong when you travel and a few things that probably can t One of the things that goes wrong is that he gets as a traveling partner Del Griffith played by John Candy who may well be the personification of every personality trait that Page does not want in someone to whom he will be in close proximity Griffith is a boisterous obnoxious shower curtain ring salesman Page is prim fastidious intolerant and uptight Fate and coincidence have bound the two of them together on a circuitous and frustrating route to Chicago Their trip is just one Murphy s Law incident after another with just about anything going wrong that Hughes s sadistic mind can arrange The basic plot if fairly predictable the two will find every possible pitfall of traveling by air rail or road Martin has some funny bits on his own but he is repeatedly upstaged by Candy who plays his part far more broadly but at the same time winningly Neither seems the kind of companion anyone would really want to go across the country with though eventually we find ourselves inexplicably liking each PLANES TRAINS AUTOMOBILES is pleasant holiday fare and worth a viewing Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0205,Empire of the Sun,1987,EMPIRE OF THE SUN is J G Ballard s semi autobiographical novel recounting his experiences as a boy in China during the Japanese occupation in World War II Tom Stoppard has adapted it for the screen and Steven Spielberg proves to have the talent of a Kubrick in directing the film Spielberg does things nearly impossible in film He has combined a spectacular with a highly personal film even mixing them in the same scene The scene in which Jim gets separated from his parents in a veritable ocean of fleeing humanity is both emotionally moving and immense This is a film filled with one strange and vivid incident after another one memorable scene after another yet one never feels there is too much frosting and not enough cake This film proves that somewhere underneath the highly commercial director is a man of great artistic talents that all too rarely get used It is incomprehensible that the director of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM also directed a film of the sensitivity of EMPIRE OF THE SUN Jim played by Christian Bale is a boy with a very believable obsession flight and airplanes It is easy for me to believe this obsession with flying would strike a responsive chord in Spielberg I know it does in me His father became wealthy in the textile industry in Shanghai in a European community incongruously identical to one that one might find in Britain Jim has led a sheltered life His big concern is building airplane models and studying aircraft His ambition is to join the Japanese military not for political reasons but because they have planes Jim s simple existence is about to come to an end The Japanese Imperial forces are about to seize Shanghai and Jim will have to fight to stay alive This story could have been told prosaically but there is little prosaic about EMPIRE OF THE SUN With Ballard s Stoppard s and Spielberg s imaginations creating images there is nothing stereotypic about this film It is amazing that such a story could be told of conflict and suffering and yet there is not a single villain and every character who speaks is fresh and new There is a sense of wonder observation of the Japanese bringers of planes to China and of the Americans who build the huge Cadillacs of the sky Just as HOPE AND GLORY a comparable but less fully realized autobiographical film gave us insights into the roots of John Boorman s love of fantasy EMPIRE OF THE SUN more than explains why Ballard writes science fictional mega disaster novels in which we see how titanic world crushing events affect common people s lives Perhaps the only thing that cuts against the credibility is that it is difficult to believe so many beautiful and enigmatic incidents could have happened to one boy EMPIRE OF THE SUN also demonstrates that Spielberg is an intelligent businessman Apparently he had only three weeks to film in China But he took much better advantage of that time than Bertolucci took of a much longer time in filming THE LAST EMPEROR In China the price of an extra is something like a dollar a day Bertolucci uses this advantage in perhaps one or two scenes notably Pu Yi s coronation as seen from above But Spielberg puts us in the middle of an ocean of panicking humanity as Shanghai is evacuated Bertolucci tells us about history Spielberg makes it happen to us Bertolucci distances us from his characters Spielberg puts us inside his This is the best film I have seen this year Perhaps the best in several years
0206,Hello Again,1987,Capsule review Director Frank Perry is best at making odd thought provoking dramas His attempt at making a light comedy in the Touchstone tradition is less than a roaring success Shelley Long plays a woman magically brought back from the dead who has to get back into life Nobody s reactions are believable Rating 0 A few months ago when OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE was released I wrote about what I expected would be fondly remembered as the Touchstone comedies They were a set of formula comedies but each was fairly enjoyable Well the formula is already starting to wear a little thin HELLO AGAIN has a below par script some spotty acting and very little in the way of humor For the first eighty minutes or so the story seems aimless but amiable then suddenly things do start to happen but nothing very good Lucy Chadman one of a number of nearly identical characters Shelley Long has played has a bland existence as the wife of a Long Island plastic surgeon About the only thing really unusual in her life is the year she was dead before her occult loving sister brought her back to life The repercussions are not unlike those in MY FAVORITE YEAR and MOVE OVER DARLING in which supposedly dead wives prove to be alive Chadman finds her husband has married her mercenary best friend played by Sela Ward who is nowhere nearly as striking as she was in NOTHING IN COMMON People react in different ways to Chadman s return and each reaction rings false This could have been a very emotional comedy but Susan Isaacs s script keeps sabotaging itself Long s character is supposed to be incredibly clumsy for no other reason than to throw in a little gratuitous slapstick It may work with some slapstick actors but Long is incredibly inept at acting inept Her pratfalls all seem mechanical and staged In fact the film has the feel of having been written for Chevy Chase and then modified for a female lead What makes the film even more disappointing is the track record of its director and writer Frank Perry and Susan Isaacs who were also responsible for COMPROMISING POSITIONS Perry s earlier works incidentally include films stranger and more memorable than HELLO AGAIN including DAVID AND LISA LADYBUG LADYBUG THE SWIMMER MAN ON A SWING and RANCHO DELUXE In such company HELLO AGAIN will be quickly forgotten Rate it a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0207,Hope and Glory,1987,HOPE AND GLORY offers a unique startling and funny child s eye view of life duing the Blitz The destruction of the oppressive row house suburb transforms it into an amusement park for the young But beyond this vision there is little in the way of plot and despite fine acting and a deft economic staging the movie must be carried by the characters whom ultimately I found stilted and unconvincing On one level the movie is a comic slice of what life was really like during the Blitz full of petty frustrations antics and concerns mocking the glory of fighting the good fight And it is the presumably autobiographical account of hope the rescue of young Bill from the clutches of suburban squalor The comic bits are crisp often brilliant be they the discussion of whether the can of German jam is really poisoned the adventure of a runaway barrage balloon or the capture by a motley crew of nervous neighbors of a downed German pilot who reeks of confidence and sexuality But for me the latter incident is the only moment the rampant randiness really works in the movie And randy it is Bill s elder sister is sexually active at 15 and pregnant by 16 the neighbor s wife boasts about her affairs and runs away with a Polish flyer his mother s affair with the neighbor may be purely Platonic his grandfather gets drunk every Christmas and toasts all the women he has bedded the neighborhood boys line up to look in the panties of a girl who exchanges the favor for looted jewelry but when his younger sister perhaps 6 offers a sage comparison of the copulatory expertise of her elder sister and lover versus her parents my patience ran out Nor do the others emerge unscathed The schoolmaster is a bastard the teacher a bitch the neighbor boys sweet innocent insensitive and headed for loutishness His dad and the neighbor are both ineffectual even impotent the aunts all stuck in bad marriages at least according to the grandfather who is a raging uninhibited spirit full of crankiness and nastiness as well as love In the second half of the movie the family moves into the grandfather s house on the river and young Bill is granted a Tom Saywer like escape from the gray suburbs with the guidance of his grandfather But like the war the ugly side of this patriarch is truly never shown and his competition for Bill s and our affection is so lightweight that the whole thing feels contrived Besides he constantly wears a white suit that made me think he was Italian Looking back the movie has a number of merits I was not prepared to concede as I left the theater But the constant sexuality was so integral to the texture of the story and stuck out like a sore thumb that I almost feel betrayed by a number of reviewers who failed to mention it at all For me Boorman is an almost director He has wonderful vision here in EXCALIBUR and in THE EMERALD FOREST but he has trouble tying up plots In THE EMERALD FOREST after weaving a wonderful modern fable of conflict between man and nature the whole thing runs out of yarn and he substitutes M 16s at 20 paces between natives in white hats and black hats And here again he has almost made a superior movie
0208,Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,1987,Note a previous review of SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID had a few errors Hanif Kureishi was the scriptwriter not the director and note the corrected spelling Rosie was played by Frances Barber not Claire Bloom The father s name was Rafi not Arif ecl Stephen Frears has directed a film that made it as a solid directorial success to his credit He directed MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE for British television It was picked up for international release and became one of the more successful art house releases of the year in spite of minor protests from the Pakistani community The film shows Pakistanis in Britain and the portrayal included positive and negative characterizations Frears s second international release is SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID As might be imagined there was something of a stir over the title The MPAA refused to register the film under that title Finally SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID was released without an MPAA rating Well was SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID worth the bruhaha Not as far as I am concerned Rafi played by Shashi Kapoor was a high official in the Pakistani government who has come to London to live with his son and daughter in law Sammy and Rosie Their marriage is falling apart each is taking other lovers as often as possible All of the couple s friends seem to be interested in sex and little else Rafi is shocked to see open lesbian relations among the friends But then what right does Rafi have to be shocked While he was in office in Pakistan he ordered brutal tortures vividly described in detail There is a race riot going on outside Claire Bloom has a small part as Rafi s once and current lover Her part is however important in that she is the only person in the film who demonstrates any value as a human being This was not my cup of bile Rate it a 1 taking into account its artistic pretensions For entertainment value it is not up to the stag films its title is reminiscent of
0209,Leonard Part 6,1987,Back in the mid to late 1960s NBC TV had the highest rated television show The show was I SPY starring Robert Culp and Bill Cosby These were still the early days of color television for many people and I SPY had enjoyable plots and was filmed in interesting locations like Hong Kong or Mexico The stories were good at least for American commercial television and the locations were great and Cosby was terrific as Alexander Scott the Rhodes scholar turned wise cracking secret agent He was the number two man to Culp s Kelly Robinson Well in those days you were more interested in the second man anyway The first guy was dull as white bread Think of THE MAN FROM UNCLE STAR TREK Martin and Lewis Abbott and Costello Rowan and Martin The top banana is there to give the audience someone to identify with and the second guy is the one with the real personality Cosby was great as an irreverent spy He was what you would get if you took the Beverly Hills Cop and injected him with 60 more IQ points and about a gallon of class The idea of an Alexander Scott like character as Cosby knows how to play him in a spy adventure is a pretty good idea Well Cosby has returned to the spy business in a film called LEONARD PART 6 Neither the title nor the poster really encourages me that this is the film I could have hoped for The credits do list Tom Courtenay who played the title character in LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER and the powerful Strelnikov in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO The film also stars Joe Don Baker and Moses Green who has real dramatic abilities So what kind of a film has Cosby who also starred and provided the story put together He has put together a film that shows exactly what he thinks will sell He has put together a film aimed at a seven year old s mind He has wasted Gunn and spit on Courtenay Anyone who has any respect for Cosby should be forced to watch this film to see what Cosby thinks of his audience Cosby plays a super super secret agent who has saved his country five times before in five stories that mercifully have never been told He has now been retired for seven years doing little but be rich The film is filled with lots of rich lifestyle jokes that were boring in ARTHUR and are worse in LEONARD And in the rich jokes is where Courtenay gets used as Leonard s butler An evil force is controlling small animals like squirrels and frogs and getting them to kill people The CIA asks for Leonard s help but he is too busy trying to win back his ex wife He is also having trouble with small animals but with him it is the shrimp his ex wife is throwing at his face Hey if you get the giggles seeing people pour food on Cosby this is the film for you Well eventually Leonard gets his act together enough that he is ready to go after the baddies That s when the film starts to go downhill And talk about product placements There is a certain brand of flavored sugar water that Cosby hawks when he isn t movie making so why should he stop when he is But of course he does it realistically and artistically In one action scene he opens a refrigerator in a fancy restaurant s kitchen and it is full of cans of the stuff more than the restaurant would use in two years In another scene he is in his fantastically well appointed exercise room in his mansion and there is a vending machine for the stuff Why he d put a vending machine in his own exercise room is never explained But the best placement is where he is having a conversation with someone and is holding a bottle of the stuff where he finds it in glass bottles anymore I have no idea placed so it is the part of the scene nearest the camera He is holding the bottle so that the name is centered for the viewer And he is holding it at the bottom third of the bottle in a way nobody holds a bottle but he has to hold it that way so his hand does not cover up the name Oh yes another scene is backstage at a theater and there piled up are literally hundreds of bars of soap of an easily readable brand Just why an acting company needs several hundred bars of soap is unclear particularly since this particular soap is recommended for hands only Being fair this film does have a few funny gags I am going to be generous and give it a low 1 After all it is the holiday season and also Cosby has done good work a couple of decades back
0210,Idolmaker The,1980,THE IDOLMAKER is a film about a songwriter who takes nobodies and turns them into singing idols during the late 1950s early 1960s Supposedly it s a fictionalized biography of Bob Marcucci who presented us with Frankie Avalon and Fabian Ray Sharkey plays Vinnie the songwriter a driven man who has been struggling for years to get his songs heard But he knows he doesn t have the look that sells so he finds someone who does and grooms him to become the next teen idol His first attempt is a wild success but he soon loses control of his prodigy and goes off to find another Vinnie spends half his time wheeling and dealing to create an image and promote his new star and the other half trying to teach the kid how to sing how to move how to support that image when he finally goes public Will Vinnie be able to do it again Will his new star rebel too And what about all the personal relationships that Vinnie s using and breaking in his drive to make it big Check it out and see OK this isn t a great film but it is well made and entertaining The settings all worked from the fish market where Vinnie gets some lessons in business from his high rolling father to the restaurant where he hangs out And there s a charming sequence in a tiny apartment where he negotiates with an old woman for permission to take her 16 year old grandson under his wing to make him idol 2 And the characterizations are all good Sharkey s will be familiar to fans of CBS s WISEGUY I don t know if this tough but vulnerable charming yet driven character is all he can do but he certainly does it to perfection Oh yes and he sings pretty well too My major beef is a minor quibble with the scenes of the singing idols doing their acts While some of the performances felt like 1959 most definitely did not and I found it a bit annoying Still overall I d recommend the film

Design and Costumes Tony Walton Director of Photography Michael Ballhaus Produced by Burtt Harris Directed by Paul Newman Sound Nat Boxer Art Director John Kasarda Set Decorator Susan Bode In 1945 Tennessee Williams created a sensation when THE GLASS MENAGERIE his first play appeared on Broadway Since then the play has been made into film on occasions in the past with Irving Rapper s 1950 version being the worst In 1986 Paul Newman saw Joanne Woodward and Karen Allen act in the play on stage at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and decided that it would be shameful not to have a permanent record of their performance Well aware of the respect accorded to William s most autobiographical and poetic play Paul Newman set out to give it a definitive treatment on film He even went so far as to declare that he wouldn t have to hire a screenwriter because I would be faithful to Tennessee While his version does respect William s intentions it unfortunately isn t the permanent reproduction Newman wants it to be Paul Newman s experience as an actor aids him considerably in eliciting good performances but it is in his camerawork that he falters ever the bane of translating stage plays to film Joanne Woodward stars in the pivotal role of Amanda the mother who tries to make her crippled and plain daughter Laura into the dream figure she desired for herself Woodward s acting is excellent and quite convincing throughout the film Her best scene is perhaps near the end of the film as Jim Laura s Gentleman Caller prepares to leave the apartment Seeing all her efforts wither away Woodward evokes a mournful sadness that resonates tremendously without degenerating to melodramatic excess In other scenes as well such as the Deception speech and the magazine subscription telephone monologues Woodward s performance comes closest to reaching the full potential of Williams lines Karen Allen proves in her performance as Laura that she can indeed handle film roles more demanding than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Serious acting is called for in this film and serious acting is what she provides Laura is a very intimate and shy woman handicapped mentally by her physical ailment Allen effectively plays Laura as an intimate and shy woman who s handicapped mentally by her physical ailment The way her eyes sparkle and come alive while talking about her prized collection of glass animal figurines round out Allen s evocative performance meeting the complexity Williams wrote into Laura s character The two men in the film do not fare nearly as well James Noughton gives a solid but uninteresting performance as the Gentleman Caller Noughton depicts Jim s past glory adequately but he fails to shine while trying to coax Laura out of her shell As idiotic as the 1950 version was Kirk Douglas was much more inspiring than Noughton is here However the source material may be the cause of this as much has been made by critics over the years of Williams typically uninteresting male characters Given his character s limitations Noughton succeeds with his performance especially when Jim realizes he has gone too far with Laura John Malkovich does not deserve any such benefit of the doubt He replaces John Sayles work on stage as Laura s brother Tom and his newcomer status shows He virtually reads out loud the famous opening monologue rendering it a dull and listless speech without much conviction He sparks little chemistry between himself and the other three actors and even his expressions of love for Karen a central and important theme of the play seem almost forced and unconvincing After lagging for most of the film his best moment undoubtedly comes as he pours forth his anguish in the closing monologue at leaving his sister where he improves dramatically no pun intended to meet Williams powerful poetic demands It is surprising that Malkovich would give such an uninspired performance because his acting has usually been quite good especially in THE KILLING FIELDS and the current EMPIRE OF THE SUN It is unfortunate that John Sayles was not available for the role Similarly it is unfortunate that Newman s camerawork calls too much attention to itself For example he badly misuses close ups by rapidly cutting from Karen to Jim when they first are left alone after dinner This kinetic editing was probably introduced to spice up the somewhat slow dialogue but it actually results in unnecessary and disorienting complications that detract from the content being conveyed Newman partially redeems this scene by emphasizing psychological distance by placing his individual characters on the extreme edges of the 1 85 frame but using the wider shape of the 2 35 CinemaScope frame would have been one possible way to accomplish the same result without resorting to choppy editing between facial closeups In other scenes Newman excessively moves his camera around characters and even behind irrelevant objects such as a lamp Tom is given his own bedroom for what seems no other reason than to give Newman another room to shoot in In one sequence the camera voyeuristically peers into the living room through the crack between two partially closed curtains but then moves through the crack pans around some characters and objects and then shows the crack again from inside the living room It s almost as if the camera were congratulating itself for having flawlessly executed such difficult movement in one continuous take And on at least one occasion the camera suddenly lurches forward for a split second before resuming a smoother and even pan Such devices uniquely belong to film and bold new applications of older techniques is one of many major avenues to advance the state of any art form Given that perhaps it could have been possible for cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and Newman to successfully integrate stylistic elements of AFTER HOURS or some of Ranier Werner Fassbinder s films many of which Ballhaus shot but unfortunately that is not the case here as their efforts distract rather than present Williams play in a new and interesting way Newman s deliberate emphasis on the filmic nature of his version comes at the expense of his sincere intention to remain faithful to Williams Worse yet continuity between shots is at times surprisingly shoddy especially for such a high class production as this one In one scene Karen s arms are folded akimbo in front of her whereas they are crossed behind her back in the very next shot when her reflection is seen in a mirror Then she is again shown with arms folded in front as the next shot s point of view shifts back to her directly Similarly a changeover from one reel to another brings on an instantaneous brightening of the apartment s lighting with no explanation or indication of why Karen and Jim s intimate candlelight conversation suddenly finds itself illuminated by a floor level spotlight The change is much too drastic to be explained by laboratory processing errors or other such possibilities These discrepancies arise from either a serious misunderstanding of filmic fundamentals or from an inattention to detail unworthy of Williams brilliance These are most certainly small and nitpicky details yet one would expect that a filmmaker who intended to create a definitive filmic recreation of such a famous play would take the necessary care to avoid such blatantly distracting maneuvers especially when previous attempts to bring the play to the screen have failed miserably The film s other technical aspects do work well however and do in fact display the careful attention to detail worthy of a labor of love missing in the camerawork and continuity The mood of the film established by its set design and lighting is properly somber with embellishments like fancy costumes and occasional lively music by Henry Mancini creating the aura of contrived yet entirely appropriate elegance Each wall has been designed separately and much thought has obviously gone into the decorations and furnishings And surprisingly enough Newman does display one brilliant inspiration in his camerawork It comes as Tom laments to himself while leaving the living room that no one had ever escaped from his neighborhood s economic and psychological doldrums The vacuum in the cinematic frame created by Tom s exit is then smoothly filled by the well lit portrait of Tom s father hung on the mantlepiece that just comes into view on the right edge of the screen The point of course is that Tom s father was the only one who did make it out although at great cost to himself and his family Contrasted to Rapper s 1950 version where Tom drunkenly bellows Except you while glaring at the portrait Newman conveys the scene s essence by using cinematic techniques with supreme subtlety and grace If only Newman had done the same in the remainder of the film his version could have been the masterpiece he so wanted it to be THE GLASS MENAGERIE is a brilliant play from a brilliant playwright and that is something difficult to disguise no matter how poorly translated or mutilated There is no doubt that Paul Newman s intentions and sincerity were true and sound and he is to be commended for bringing the fine acting of three actors of the Williamstown stage to the world Modern audiences will enjoy the pleasures that do exist in the film which are considerable indeed But those pleasures stem mainly from Tennessee Williams words and the actors who bring those words to life It seems clear that Paul Newman s technical direction is the weakest element in the film Directorial Filmography of Paul Newman Paul Newman has been acting in films like THE HUSTLER THE TORN CURTAIN BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID THE STING ABSENCE OF MALICE and THE VERDICT for over 25 years and he won the Best Actor Oscar last year for THE COLOR OF MONEY He is active in many social and political causes and manages to find time to engage in his favorite hobby race car driving He has been married to Joanne Woodward since 1958
0212,Hanoi Hilton The,1987,The film industry seems unsure how to show the Vietnam War in film They want so desperately to please but they are not sure what the buying public thinks of the war When they think the public wants to see films that say the war was terrible they make films like APOCALYPSE NOW On the other hand the audience that is into beefcake stars wants to feel we could have smeared the enemy so they get films of macho stars either breaking out of POW camps or back in to rescue Americans still there The poor film industry is aiming at a fragmented target of public opinion But they sure know that it is public opinion they have to match If they don t show the war exactly the way the public thinks of the war it will cost them big bucks at the boxoffice Hey if you want to deliver a message send a telegram That s the old adage of the film industry No film about the war has shot so far wide of the public opinion mark as HANOI HILTON You may remember it it may have played a week at a theater near you HANOI HILTON is the story of the men interred in a POW camp in Hanoi Most of the men believed in what they were doing Perhaps they did not believe in the war but they did believe in not being broken by their captors The films paints the POWs as heroic the captors as cruel and the news and movie media as being dupes used by the Vietcong None of that is too great a leap of imagination There is nothing particularly hard to believe in the entire film My understanding is that POWs endorse the film as being fairly realistic The plot is not unusual or particularly new It just shows how prisoners found ways to communicate with each other and support each other under interrogations that sometimes included torture Again nothing new for the cinema there were similar films about World War II but then POW camps probably have not changed that much either There has been some comment about how unfairly a visiting celebrity obviously intended to be Jane Fonda is treated by the film My personal belief is that Ms Fonda was at this point a woman very committed to her ideals who had already been shown some of the destruction that air bombing had done in North Vietnam That would have meant she had reason to be unsympathetic to the downed airmen and unsympathetic is all the film accuses her of being A journalist earlier in the film is portrayed as much worse HANOI HILTON certainly appears to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of one aspect of the Vietnam War In spite of a lot of unfavorable comment by other reviewers I think it deserves a 2
0213,Empire of the Sun,1987,Steven Spielberg s EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a masterful movie The attention to details in the composition of each scene is a joy to watch From a cliche d opening view of water in Shanghai harbor that is suddenly rudely interrupted by floating coffins that are in turn shoved aside by a Japanese patrol boat to some of the most frantic and eerie crowd scenes the film doesn t settle for casual ways to portray an event The effect is a masterpiece The main character in EMPIRE OF THE SUN is an airplane obsessed British schoolboy growing up in the British sector of Shanghai just as World War II is becoming fierce His experiences as he loses his family and is forced to fend for himself in a Japanese prison camp are wondrously textured Although I liked HOPE AND GLORY a film with a somewhat similar theme EMPIRE OF THE SUN seems vastly superior HOPE AND GLORY has to rely on distracting subplots involving such trivialities as affairs between characters that have little do with the main point of the film In EMPIRE OF THE SUN such useless filler is avoided Each scene does its bit to influence Jim s character and to add enlightening detail to the mood of the film Perhaps the full three hours of film is not justified for the plot and some extra cutting could have been made but the rich texture would have suffered Among the more moving scenes in the film one involving Japanese kamikaze pilots absolutely astounded me The scene arises unexpectedly and is masterfully handled to bring across the full tragedy and glory of the event without trivializing the emotion I was wishing that it would be further dragged out but the scene that follows arises perfectly and is itself wondrous as well The final scene in the film although well done is of a more typical style that most directors could have thought of and handled almost as well The difficulty in bringing about the proper feelings in the kamikaze scene is shown even more sharply when contrasted with the more conventional kind of scene that ends the movie Details omitted to avoid spoilers The minute attention to detail that fills each scene was impressive as was the historical accuracy Such small items as a British silver half crown with George VI or the insignia on Jim s school uniform as well as larger ones such as each character speaking a believable language adds an admirable layer of accuracy and a very fine texture to scenes that are already wonderfully composed The film at times reaches a dreamlike quality such as in a scene near the beginning of the film when the British residents are all being chauffeured to a costume party through mobs of terrified Chinese fleeing the Japanese or another beautiful yet eerie scene of a stadium filled with looted furniture statues and valuables Such scenes are not inordinately or pretentiously dwelt upon or worse recalled through flashbacks and after the film is over are among the more vivid and lasting images Despite its theme the film comes across neither as brutally depressing nor mindlessly uplifting The characters are all portrayed believably Some of the Japanese guards are at times brutal yet none are strictly seen as villains and the film could never be seen as an anti Japanese film The Americans who send in tremendous amounts of raw materials either in the form of B 29 bombers the Cadillacs of the sky or oversized canisters of food complete with Lucky Strikes and Hershey bars where do they find Hershey bars that big these days are portrayed somewhat tongue in cheek and are neither slandered nor unfairly glorified Although I saw it three days ago I m still moved by EMPIRE OF THE SUN I consider it one of the best films I ve seen The plot is lightly sketched but this in no way detracts from the simple joy of watching an amazingly crafted work I admit that I failed to understand much of the hoopla associated with Spielberg on account of THE COLOR PURPLE but EMPIRE OF THE SUN can only be a work of true genius
0214,Throw Momma from the Train,1987,It appears that here is a movie that is either embraced and loved or condemned and despised There is no in between The critics have loved it And most people I have talked to have despised it Someone posted a review here saying how much he hated it Two women in the theater restroom after the movie couldn t say enough bad things about it It would be silly of me to recommend a movie that generates such varying responses I liked it a lot and my husband liked it even more But it is a strange movie I have to admit that It s funny but not like BEVERLY HILLS COP so there isn t mass appeal We have Owen Danny DeVito who hates his mother and who is a little crazy And we have Larry Billy Crystal who is a writer who hates his ex wife because she stole his novel Owen wants his mother dead Larry wants his wife dead or so Owen believes Strange things start happening and Larry gets caught up in a plot that totally throws him off balance The story is about Larry and the direction helps to throw the audience off balance the way that Larry is thrown off balance There are interesting segues that confuse You don t know where you are sometimes or how you got there or how you ll get out There are funny lines scattered throughout the film but you can t depend on these for the laughs You have to be able to laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation and the lunacy of the characters particularly Owen who is really off the wall Anne Ramsey as Momma is totally despicable and hilarious I can t universally recommend this film because it depends too much on personal taste This movie doesn t have mass appeal in my mind because it is so strange But I liked it all the same
0215,Broadcast News,1987,Let me blurt it right out BROADCAST NEWS is one of the best films of the year It s common for the studios to hold their Oscar hopefuls for Christmas We should be hearing about this film again in February The cast is fabulous Albert Brooks gets most of the film s many funny lines and delivers a poignant performance as the well educated reporter who just can t make it on camera William Hurt shows yet another facet of his talent by playing the well meaning but shallow sportscaster who is hurtled toward the anchor desk by sheer dint of good looks He s not really an airhead but he is as we say in the trade just a little behind the audience My favorite discovery was Holly Hunter if she isn t nominated then the Academy has less soul than even I suspect As the obsessive compulsive news producer she dominates the film while she tries to dominate her job There is also what amounts to a wonderful cameo by a well known actor but I don t want to spoil it for you You ll know what I mean when you see the film The intelligent script is fairly littered with gems I heard so many good lines many of them in background conversation that I can t begin to remember them all It makes me want to rent it on video and sit down with a note pad and a remote control As the story is told of the developing love triangle all three characters are brought out as sympathetic breathing human beings We wind up liking them each so much that we don t want any of them to be hurt But the bittersweet nature of the comedy starts to appear near the end when we realize that in a triangle somebody has to lose The ending surprised me and may disappoint some but rings very true BROADCAST NEWS is refreshingly well researched Everything about the frenetic neurotic nature of television is right on the money Most people will probably think that it was all exaggerated for the movie I hope at least that they learn something about what goes on behind the little glass screen But don t go just to get educated Go to enjoy yourself
0216,Broadcast News,1987,Capsule review A winning romantic comedy also takes some reasonably good shots at the television network news business James L Brooks TERMS OF ENDEARMENT has made an adult film with solid characters Rating 2 In fairly short order Twentieth Century Fox has brought out two what goes on behind the scenes films each by a director of a film that won an Oscar for Best Picture Each is a glossy high budget production and that is where the similarity ends Oliver Stone s WALL STREET is unoriginal and predictable and has poorly developed characters What WALL STREET has to say about the world of high finance you already know You probably already know everything about network news you will learn from BROADCAST NEWS but along with the social statement you will get three interesting characters in one of the best love triangle films since PHILADELPHIA STORY Nobody is reduced to being the other man or the woman Instead you have three well defined characters who do not grow tiresome BROADCAST NEWS is 131 minutes long but characters like these could have carried a film twice as long Holly Hunter every bit as energetic as she was in another great comedy RAISING ARIZONA plays Jane Craig a high tension news producer who usually works with reporter Aaron Altman played by Albert Brooks high IQ low charisma Along comes the network s new anchorman Tom Grunick sincere hard working and good looking but he doesn t always understand the news he s reading Any bets who Jane ends up with Don t bet This is not a pat predictable comedy of the type we get so many of these days The characters are three dimensional and have minds of their own James L Brooks wrote produced and directed the film undoubtedly getting backing on the strength of his TERMS OF ENDEARMENT I personally did not respond well to the characters in that film but BROADCAST NEWS offers a much better choice Two of the three leads are supposed to be highly intelligent and Brooks manages to write them so they really seem to be as well as all three being just quirky enough to be real BROADCAST NEWS is a sign that the film industry is starting to recover from the post STAR WARS decade and is starting to go back to making films as adult audience can appreciate I would hope it would be nominated for Best Picture at least though it would not be my choice to win Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0217,*batteries not included,1987,I haven t written many reviews lately mostly because the movies seem to get to other cities before ours and because they pretty much summed up what I would say anyway In the case of BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED however I want to be the first to warn everyone Stay Away From This Movie Siskel and Ebert split on BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED Ebert was in a good mood and recommended it for the special effects and the cute models Siskel thought it just didn t work What neither mentioned however is that this film is just plain depressing when it isn t stupid and badly written Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy star as a couple living in a tenement building in New York and running a diner in the commercial space on the first floor The rest of the neighborhood has been bought up and flattened by a Donald Trump style developer who now wants to demolish the one remaining brownstone theirs so that he can build a lavish commercial development To this end he alternately bribes the residents of the building with envelopes of cash and threatens them with attacks by the local Hispanic gang whose leader is basically good but just Never Had a Dad Big Brothers of America where are you Cronyn has it tough Tandy is senile and believes that Eisenhower is still alive and the Hispanic tough is her long lost son Bobby Of course things are bad all over the building The sweet pregnant thing upstairs abandoned by her musician boyfriend is scared for the health of her baby so she won t go to a doctor Her neighbor the artist has just been jilted by his girlfriend The building super is a simple but sweet ex boxer who spends his days watching TV and trying to repair the tile in the foyer This one building contains more Need than any other place in the universe as a result of which it attracts these mechanical elf things from outer space who want to use the electrical outlets and fix the place up Do things get better No Everything stays rotten although the appliances now work All the needy people stay unhappy hopeless and forgotten for the most part The air of unremitting sadness and gloom never dissipates for a moment The least the stupid machines could do is fix Tandy s head so she ll stop talking about Bobby and Cronyn will stop scowling Don t take your children to see this movie Don t take your loved ones to see this movie Send someone you hate it will make them suicidal Do I sound too negative Then the machines were really cute I just loved the little buggers If you think cute mute flying robots are worth 90 minutes of pointless pathos this is a film for you P S If for some reason you are forced at gunpoint to see BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED watch for the scene where the developer is fiddling with a model of the development Look between the two towers for the wee model of the tenement Very sloppy Moderator s note There seems to be no consensus on whether the title includes the leading asterisk or not Since the ads show it as part of the title I will presume that the makers of the film intended it to be that way and include it here ecl
0218,Wall Street,1987,Capsule review Oliver Stone s film about his father s profession It does the difficult task of making the world of finance interesting In the final analysis it is just a reworking of Rod Serling s teleplay and film PATTERNS The coming attraction was put together with more skill than the film was Rating 0 There s an old television ad for a business magazine that shows a sword fight in a board room The idea was to show that business is exciting stuff that companies fight it out like Robin Hood and the Sheriff Some ad agency just came to the realization that while a lot that is exciting happens it is tough to show that on film Most of the excitement comes from numbers on a board That is what killed ROLLOVER a few years back At least initially you had to get interested enough in numbers The last half hour made ROLLOVER a lot better if not downright worth seeing It is tough to get people really into a movie about finance Oliver Stone actually manages to keep the audience interested He also tells a pretty good story or at least retells a pretty good story The original assuming it was original even then is Rod Serling s PATTERNS Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox an ambitious young stockbroker who really wants to make it to the top The top is Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas Gekko deals in billions of dollars every year He buys and sells companies but he needs information and promises to make Fox rich along the way if Fox will get him information Fox knows a lot of what he is being asked to do illegal but necessary to get to the top You can pretty much figure out the film from that On hand as Fox s father Carl is Martin Sheen of all people Carl is not like Bud He is a hard working union man who does not understand his son s career This part is not borrowed from the Serling but enough working class fathers not understanding non working class sons is a well worn cliche Like Oliver Stone s PLATOON WALL STREET was inspired by Stone s personal history Stone s father was a stockbroker so Stone grew up knowing about the tensions and pressures of stock trading perhaps the swashbuckling aspect of it It is a pity his father didn t tell him a more interesting and original story he could adapt into a film Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0219,Suspect,1987,Detective novels tend to have the detective who goes out on his own to solve a crime That works find in books because the author can say in text what the detective is thinking And what the detective is thinking is important to the plot In film you usually are told what the detective is thinking in one of two ways Voice over first person narration was popular in the 1940s detective films It may even have become cliche A comedy currently running on cable called EAT AND RUN would be the final coffin nail for the voice over if it was any better known The other approach is to send someone around with the detective who may or may not be a detective also Holmes had Watson Smith had Petrie Chan had Number One Son Nick had Nora The more interesting the relationship the better SUSPECT is a mystery courtroom drama worthy of the old PERRY MASON show but the gimmick is that the detective pair cannot be seen together Kathleen Riley played by Cher is a public defender appointed to the case of a derelict accused of murder Eddie Sanger played by Dennis Quaid is a juror with a quick and logical mind who finds he is better at defending the derelict that Riley is Sanger has sufficient has sufficient reason to disqualify himself as a juror and have a substitute replace him just as would happen if he had appendicitis That would free him to help defend the charged man which is clearly where his heart is But that would mean there would be no story here Instead he and Riley sneak around and she agonizes over the ethics of the situation The narrative line of SUSPECT is a little unusual It begins with four widely separated plot strands that take a little while to wind together So the opening is perhaps confusing or intriguing depending on your point of view There is a completely extraneous subplot of Sanger lobbying for dairy price supports on Capitol Hill which broadens his character a little but could easily have been trimmed from this unusually long film The final scene of the film intended to lighten the proceedings is miscalculated and is out of character for the serious lawyer Cher plays Cher is supposed to be a competent lawyer in an unusual role for her She does better by the role than does the scriptwriter who has her overlook some very basic aspects of the evidence leaving Sanger to point them out to her Along those lines this is the third film I have seen in about a month in which a defense lawyer unexpectedly tosses an object to a defendant to establish left or right handedness Quaid adds another boyish enthusiasm role to a filmography already stocked with them Joseph Mantegna who did such a superb job in HOUSE OF GAMES is on hand in a less noticeable role as the prosecuting attorney SUSPECT has a reasonably good plot and some acceptable acting but some minor script problems Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0220,Empire of the Sun,1987,Much has been said in this newsgroup about Steven Spielberg and EMPIRE OF THE SUN the film his admirers point to as his masterpiece I was not a Spielberg hater before I saw EMPIRE OF THE SUN but then I had not seen a Spielberg movie since E T when I was a much more naive movie watcher I came out of EMPIRE OF THE SUN really detesting Spielberg s idiosyncracies and excesses I ll only touch on the essentials As usual I ll try to steer clear of politics It s a travesty of the word ideologue to call Spielberg one John R I won t make any comparisons with the book as I have not read it though I m familiar with Ballard s earlier work which I ve been told is quite different from EMPIRE OF THE SUN There are several scenes in EMPIRE OF THE SUN that I really liked The crowd scenes in the beginning were very effective The scene in the junk yard with the furniture and piano was brilliant But as a whole EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a small minded blatantly manipulative movie It drips with sentimentality and stock Spielberg Hollywood images and situations and clumsily tramples over its interesting moments with contrived histrionics Several scenes have effective sound devices but the movie drowns under a sea of saccharine strings and transcendental female choral music The beginning of the scene with the kamikaze pilots was handled skillfully but Spielberg the arch audience manipulator takes over when the kid Jim salutes them and starts singing Not only does he sing but the song echoes through the POW camp and by the time it becomes a female vocalist I suppose we re all supposed to be crying And of course Jim has to look like an E T kid and have a Vienna Boys Choir type voice But that s a matter of taste Spielberg even sabotages his own clumsy attempt at structure near the end Jim is riding his bicycle in the abandoned camp obvious reflection of an earlier scene where he was riding his bicycle in an abandoned house Of course Spielberg cannot resist another typically Spielberg esque miracle when a canister of food falls through the roof and we are treated to the typical Hollywood radiant sense of wonder shot of Jim s face Finally there is no excuse for this movie to last 2 1 2 hours Much of what happened in the last hour were non essential action sequences or overlong rapt contemplations of not very interesting images Obviously Spielberg is not an inept film maker Some scenes in EMPIRE OF THE SUN are really effective recall for example the scene where Jim tries to stop his former servants from plundering his house and one of them nonchalantly walks over and slaps him But it seems Spielberg will never pass up on the smallest opportunity to tweak at the collective heartstrings of his audience And he doesn t seem willing to break free of the Hollywood vocabulary of stock images and characters some of which he has created it is true Only the memory of several well executed scenes kept me from walking out on this movie
0221,Brazil,1985,I know it s out of the ordinary to have a book review in this newsgroup THE BATTLE OF BRAZIL Jack Mathews s book about Terry Gilliam s struggle with Hollywood to release his film is an extraordinary book It chronicles in frightening detail what it is like to deal with the big studio system and how just this once the Director won Life imitated art when Gilliam s masterpiece of fantasy and dehumanizing bureaucracy fell into the fell clutches of a lawyer cum studio exec Sid Sheinberg Hint It was Sheinberg s idea to replace the symphonic Jerry Goldsmith score for LEGEND with syntho pop Tangerine Dream music There it sat at Universal perhaps the most Orwellian overgrown Big Hollywood Studio of them all and they didn t know what to do with it What they tried and almost succeeded to do with it was turn BRAZIL into a confused bland happy ending romantic comedy One of the best features of the book is a complete annotated script Many of the notes explain what changes were made for the Universal version Chilling Absolutely chilling Illustrative are a few of the alternate titles sent by Universal to Gilliam who figured they must have a drawer of unused movie titles somewhere I m not making these up and they re all at least this bad This constitutes the best evidence I ve ever seen for rampant drug abuse in Hollywood Film buffs and people who appreciate Gilliam s brilliant vision will devour THE BATTLE OF BRAZIL with a passion And it even has a happy ending
0222,Throw Momma from the Train,1987,Capsule review Danny DeVito s directing debut seems to indicate he is not yet ready to direct The characters are neither believable nor likable and the comedy is not funny DeVito needs and deserves a better director than DeVito Rating 1 I think most successful comic actors should learn from Harry Langdon s career Langdon made a number of successful comedies back in the silent era He had a funny face that just worked well with screen comedy He was also ambitious and wanted to direct his own films He spread a rumor that his director Frank Capra really was an incompetent and that he himself did most of the direction on his films So the studio let Frank Capra go Fear not it was a while but Capra DID eventually get work directing films again Langdon directed his own comedies for two or three flops then he let other directors misuse him and his career just sort of petered out Not everyone who is good in comedy acting knows how to direct him or herself Gene Wilder is another example A third is probably Danny DeVito DeVito needs a director who wants to and knows how to show him off I have been surprised by how many fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT do not even remember that DeVito was in those films DeVito has been funny only when he has had really talented directors His first attempt to direct himself just proves he does not yet have that talent THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN is a patchwork of comedy styles that never gels into a real film The plot is a sendup of Hitchcock s STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Larry played by Billy Crystal is a writing instructor who teaches his class that a writer always writes He himself however has a writing block connected with his hatred of his ex wife a hatred he makes no secret Owen played by Danny DeVito is a student in his class hatching murder plots in fiction and for real equally incompetently Owen s mother is about as revolting as a woman can appear on screen and Owen quite justifiably wants to do her in Through misunderstanding Owen thinks Larry has suggested an exchange of murders to throw off the police
0223,Personal Services,1987,It is tough to say exactly where this film went wrong This is a sad parable of a boy with rat like features For years he has lived in a junkyard thought by everyone to be just one more legend Then he is kidnapped and falls into the hands of Sondra Locke who wants to exploit him to make a fortune In retrospect a lot of the film was probably intended to be funny but just wasn t The film s view of humanity as being entirely selfish and callous just is too familiar Like HAROLD AND MAUDE this film was probably not intended to be a first run hit but to become a cult film Unfortunately it never has the right touch RATBOY is a production of Clint Eastwood s company Malpaso These days usually Eastwood directs Malpaso films this time he has allowed his frequent co star to direct Rating 0 All films will be rated on the 4 to 4 scale This film came as something of a surprise not because it was unusual but because after a few good reviews it turned out to be remarkably and unexpectedly usual In spite of pretensions to be something more PERSONAL SERVICES is little different from a lot of English sex comedies that get picked up to run on cable after midnight Julie Waters who was so good in EDUCATING RITA plays a character the film claims was inspired by but not based on Cynthia Payne a notorious London madam Due to unfortunate financial pressures Cynthia is forced to become first a prostitute and then a madam For a hard hitting realistic view of the world of prostitution PERSONAL SERVICES is right up there with THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS There is no attempt at impartiality and eventually the film degenerates to pure sex farce Rating 0 Spend a couple of hours safety pinned to a punk rocker See Sid Vicious slam his head against a brick wall to get a reaction from his girl friend Watch him for two hours doing the same thing figuratively to get a recation from anyone who will give it This is an uncompromising film that never asks you to care for punk rocker Sid or his girlfriend Nancy just as they never seem to first we see Sid among the London punk culture They do likeable things like spray paint graffiti on borrowed apartments or kick in windshields of Rolls Royces In the second part of the film we see them among bewildered non punkers They go to the United States as part of a tour and among other activities visit Nancy s grandparents who quickly tire of the little parasites The title characters lead pointless useless lives that are cut mercifully short by early deaths Rating 1
0224,House of Games,1987,This film reminds me of SLEUTH THE CONVERSATION and BLOW UP That makes two pluses and a minus but not in that order It has an undercurrent of violence and as the movie progresses insanity a current that eddies in your subconscious and only surfaces later In one sentence it is the story of a woman who sick of her life takes a walk on the wild side In two it is an elaborate con gone awry It is clever but flawed She is not quite believable the plot is not quite believable it is one of those plots where everything too neatly fits And it relies too much on misdirection for its effect I could see what was coming next not always but too often So I keep thinking that it is too witty too slick to be that good In fact there is a time in the movie after which they were in such a hurry to wrap it all up that it is plainly forced Perhaps it is the suspicion that it is merely an understated piece of feminist propaganda delving into real persona purely by accident that leaves me feeling so ambiguous about this film Certainly both women in the film are strong successful professionals and all the men are conniving and criminally deceitful albeit there is a certain necessity for this there are no loose strings no gratuitous anything Certainly the men prey on the women well on the woman And certainly she gets even So it could be femiganda but the rhetoric is missing and she is subtly demented always and she is unusually dense We figure out what is going on long long long before she does So if it is femiganda it s an ambivalent strain and I like it anyway This one gets 4 out of 5 on my 1 to 5 point order of magnitude scale
0225,Eddie Murphy Raw,1987,Capsule review Ultimately a very downbeat and bitter stand up comic concert film The problem is not that the humor is tasteless but that it is not particularly clever RAW is a short film that has occasional laugh out loud jokes but not enough to make it worthwhile Rating 0 I am not sure you can measure a concert film by the same standards by which you measure other films Certainly a lot of the criteria you would apply to the quality of a dramatic film just do not apply to a concert film considerations like Did the plot make sense But then if one says a concert film is not a dramatic film can you really say that MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is It is somewhere in the gray area between drama and concert film Well one thing that seems to be called a concert film is a filmed comedy act by a stand up comic If you look at Webster a single person cannot give a concert it has to be a concerted effort Eddie Murphy s RAW just barely squeaks by on a technicality And if RAW does just squeak by that is just about the only place it does squeak Generally it tends to roar in language that will never make it to commercial television In fact part of Murphy s appeal seems to be in the creative ways he finds to use profanity And his appeal is undeniable and amazing He has a line of anti feminist and anti homosexual patter that would do a Grand Wizard proud and yet it is considered unobjectionable because it is embedded in profanity like almonds in a Hershey bar and hence is funny It can be a strange world RAW begs comparison to other black stand up comic concert films particularly those of Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby Even more than of dramatic films comparisons of stand up comics will be a matter of taste but for my money Murphy comes in a distinct third Of the three comics Cosby is the funniest There is nothing I have ever seen Murphy do that has had me laughing like Cosby s dentist routine From Cosby to Pryor to Murphy the jokes become more bitter less creative more profane and generally less funny Murphy does a good impression of Cosby telling him to clean up his act but the profanity that is Murphy s trademark is the least of his faults Murphy s humor is at bottom very downbeat and often as when he describes his bowel movements just not all that interesting Rate RAW a flat 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0226,Music of the Spheres,1984,Capsule review Rock bottom budget science fiction film has little or nothing to offer but some really intriguing science fiction ideas If you disliked films like LIFEFORCE and PRINCE OF DARKNESS you re going to really hate this one and I suggest you watch THE TERMINATOR again instead Rating 2 One of the oddest science fiction films of the 1960s is CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS It was an incredible combination of the very good and the very bad It was made on a lemonade stand budget The sets were cheap the acting incompetent But the script had interesting ideas mostly based on Jack Williamson s Humanoids stories There was some decent drama that led one to believe this might have made a decent stage play It has remained a cult film and a curiosity It was quite unique until now I think I have just seen my choice for the Creation of the Humanoids of the 1980s It has a classy title MUSIC OF THE SPHERES it has some pretty heavy ideas going for it But the budget is bargain basement some of the acting and all of the special effects are terrible Watch it carefully for ten minutes if you are not intrigued by the film in that time shut it off The film is set in a future perhaps a century from now The superpowers have fallen apart of their own weight and after the chaos came an order controlled by huge biological computers the largest of which is called the Beast The computers have minds of their own and the only way they can be controlled or even communicated with is by having a specially selected human mind meld with them And it is important to have a human mind meld with the Beast because the computer is being used to implement a project to turn three asteroids into solar cells that will beam a constant supply of energy via microwaves to Earth But the Beast seems to be trying to prevent the project from going ahead Do you think I am telling you too much This much all comes out in the first five minutes or so and the ideas keep coming This is a Canadian film done in English and French with subtitles The cost of the film was reportedly C110 000 in 1983 That is almost certainly less than 1 of what a film like THE TERMINATOR cost and that s low budget Of course the production values are dirt cheap and the film needed a stronger ending But ideas are cheap so this film has more than you can take in on one viewing Where did this thing turn up Cable television s USA station ran it on a late night counter culture program called NIGHT FLIGHT I doubt that one in a hundred science fiction fans will even like the film be warned But for the few who are willing to put up with its rough edges I d rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0227,Good Morning Vietnam,1987,There is a spate of films coming out about the Vietnam experience Most seem to focus on large aspects of the war FULL METAL JACKET was spread between Marine training and the Tet Offensive HANOI HILTON was about the POW experience PLATOON put us into the boots of American ground troops GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is an exception It is mostly about what would be a minor footnote to the war a disc jockey Adrian Cronauer played by Robin Williams brought in to keep the troops morale up Cronauer has to fight a separate war not against the enemy but against his own immediate superiors who want him to play music fit for elevators and to keep his humor toned down Often in this sort of film it is the brass that does not understand the rebel and people on his own level defend him One of the interesting reversals in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is that here the top brass want to keep the disc jockey Far from the usual cliche of dehumanized generals making unfeeling decisions this an anti military film in which the highest ranking officer is one of the heroes of the film There is another interesting reversal Many war films have two plot lines the main character s personal life and his professional life But the personal plot line will have little to do with the war only the professional life plot line will really have the war as an important element THE CAINE MUTINY is a good example the superfluous love story could easily have been moved to a non war setting GOOD MORNING VIETNAM does just the reverse The main plot line could have been moved to WNBC in New York without much change It is the love story that really requires the Vietnam War setting Part of what bothers me about GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is that it feels like it is rearing back to make some sort of powerful statement but if the punch ever hit I missed it There is some talk about Americans seeing Vietnamese as animals but much of the film makes the point that there are caring Americans and we see really only two who are not There is a dab of horrors of war scenes but not much to emphasize the point Director Barry Levison is used to making gentle human dramas like DINER and TIN MEN His most biting film to date was AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and his heart just did not seem to be into making a bitter anti American statement GOOD MORNING VIETNAM leaves ample places for Robin Williams to do his thing He does wild improvisational comedy at the microphone some quite good It has the feel of being spontaneous and if it is he must be some sort of genius GOOD MORNING VIETNAM is not the film it could have been but deserves a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0228,Good Morning Vietnam,1987,This new film is a fabulous stream of consiousness riff by Robin Williams surrounded by a remarkably dull war story It is supposed to be based on a real life 60s army radio MC but it does no good to know that Perhaps the war story is something on which he insisted I saw the movie a week ago and now I believe the purpose of the silly story is to give the audience time to relax their mouths and cheeks and catch some breath as breathing is hard when you re laughing as much as you do while Mr Williams is working A couple of years ago Mr Williams rented the Metropolitan Opera House which seats 3 718 people and performed an intimate monologue there During that show he occasionally became less funny But breathing was an obstacle Both for him he speaks so fast I have doubts as to how he inhales at all and for the audience we were rolling in the aisles I believe it was filmed for TV That might be the best way to see him with the less funny material edited out and a remote control so one can stop it every once in a while and respire But this film has enough of Mr Williams being funny to make it worth the 7 I think I paid 30 for the Met and enough fluff to leave time to breath
0229,September,1987,We are told this disappointing film takes place in Vermont Mia Farrow returns to Peyton Place but we never really know that as not one shot is filmed out of doors Action takes place within the claustrophobic environs of a country house with six characters pairing off into conversations that others intrude upon regularly Even the choreography of this film is boring The conversations that do occur when the characters relate have to do with tales of unrequited love passion fulfilled pseudo step patricide friendship betrayed and other matters of depth With drinks in hand I don t remember a movie with so much liquid refreshment Never a light moment Or a refreshing one Or a humorous one Or And all of this angst is relayed to us in what may be cartoon voices Mia Farrow whines Dianne Wiest sulks Elaine Stritch has gravel on her tonsils Eli Wallach whispers Even Sam Waterston normally a fine actor kvetches I believe that sometimes we learn through other people s art Sitting through this movie was an excruciating experience I am hoping that in the future I will be able to use some of the pain to better my life Else there would have been no point at all to the 7 ticket price
0231,Sid and Nancy,1986,When I heard that a film was being made about Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen I figured Well I guess it was inevitable that someone would wind up doing a Sex Pistols retrospective Let s go see how badly they messed it up I was amazed that Alex Cox managed to make a movie that was both true to the characters and comercially viable SID AND NANCY is a very slick movie about a very dirty grimy subject The slickness of the photography and the choreography of the scenes manages to balance out the coarseness of the subject matter Gary Oldman plays Sid More to the point Gary Oldman is Sid Vicious or the closest we can hope to see since Sid s death He even looks like Sid It s almost scary Give the man a cookie He s earned it Chloe Webb is made to look a whole lot like Nancy The most uncannily accurate aspect of her portrayal is the voice she sounds 99 like Nancy The only real failure I saw was that Chloe didn t affect a British accent every thirtieth word Nancy Spungen lived a long time in London and her heavy Bronx accent would give way to an altered British pronunciation every once in a while The characters of Sid and Nancy are so faithfully portrayed that it s almost scary However some of the lesser characters are not quite to faithfully portrayed John Lydon s character seems to have been cast for the singing voice alone The actor whose name escapes me doesn t quite manage to capture Johnny Rotten except for the singing voice His mannerisms are not right his composure is far off base but the overall impression is right on target The same holds true for the characterization of Malcolm McLaren the character in the movie is an exaggeration of Malcolm not a realistic portrayal In both characters we do not see a realistic portrayal Neither actor looks or acts like the person he portrays Instead we are given an impressionistic view both characters represent the effects that the people had on Sid and Nancy not the actual people they are based on And don t forget this is SID AND NANCY not SID AND NANCY AND JOHN AND MALCOLM Apart from these portrayals Mr Cox has gone to some pains to set his scenes in a world controlled subtly by the characters For example the first view we have of Sid and John is of them as they demolish a Rolls Royce A bit later we see Sid and friends walking along the street On the surface you hear a fairly mundane conversation However if you pay attention to the background you will see a bunch of school kids in uniform running up the street and making a ruckus They are beating cars with their lacrosse sticks Shades of Sid and John s influence on the kids Maybe Pay closer attention The kids are beating only on the old beat up cars They don t touch the Rolls Royces or BMW s This is actually a much better image of how the mainstream kids of England took the Sex Pistols and their anarchy As a whole I give extreme kudos to Alex Cox for making SID AND NANCY In this movie he has given much more information about Sid Vicious the Sex Pistols Nancy Spungen and the whole musical social revolution in the UK than anyone else has dared to try before The movie is far more impressionistic and at times surrealistic than anyone tends to give it credit for I also would like to suggest D O A as a companion piece for SID AND NANCY D O A chronicles the Sex Pistols American tour during which they disbanded pardon the pun D O A is a documentary including interviews with Sid and Nancy SID AND NANCY is a grand piece of impressionistic fictionalization Watch them both Turn the sound up REALLY LOUD Bang your head Slam dance with whoever is closest to you even if you ve never slammed before Spit at the TV Find the punk that you didn t think resided in you The last time that D O A played at UNC the audience did several hundred dollars worth of damage to the Student Union No real point I d just thought I d say that Moderator s note Do not confuse the D O A that Green describes with the 1949 Edmond O Brien film that shows up all the time on television because it s in the public domain not the remake with Dennis Quaid soon to be released They re interesting in their own way of course but if you re expecting the Sex Pistols and get Edmond O Brien instead you ll probably be disappointed
0232,Siesta,1987,I just love it when this happens I went to see SIESTA mostly because I didn t know a thing about it other than what the poster said which wasn t much I soon realized that I had either seen a review of it on the telly or a trailer but I had forgotten anything said about it So there I am watching the opening titles and names start to roll by Martin Sheen Ellen Barkin Grace Jones Isabella Rosellini Jody Foster Jody Foster Yup A name I didn t recognize was Mary Lambert the director Starting with a strange stunning opening sequence she starts telling a story by inter cutting with flashbacks Barkin wakes up outdoors wearing nothing but a red dress She finds somebody s blood all over it and then realizes that she s lying at the foot of a runway Things get rolling when she finds that she s in another country with no money passport nor idea how she got there She gradually starts to remember things via flashbacks which parallel what s happening to her She meets some very strange people and has some very strange things happen to her None of them seem as strange as the stunt she was planning to free fall from an airplane into a burning net You see she s the strangest character in the film Barkin who didn t do that much for me somehow in THE BIG EASY plays wonderfully all the way from An Eyeful down to a wretched mess as her character gets deeper and deeper into the nightmare Steamy sardonic slightly disorienting SIESTA is almost impossible to pigeonhole That s my favorite thing about it It belongs in the slightly off center bin with films such as TROUBLE IN MIND and AFTER HOURS except toward the side of the bin with THE STUNTMAN in it The slightly over the top dialogue seems strained at the beginning of the film but perfectly natural by the end Some of the scene transitions are really brilliant Lambert leaves no doubt that she knows how to direct I love stumbling across a find like this SIESTA is a horse of a different color It may not achieve a great commercial success but if you like off the wall well crafted movies as well as I do you should check it out
0234,Moonstruck,1987,The children of the post war baby boom are edging their way up around forty and it has been a while since filmmakers have targeted the forty and up crowd Then the final months of 1987 saw two good comedies that did not taste of bubble gum One was BROADCAST NEWS and the other only now getting a wide release is MOONSTRUCK Norman Jewison who is still on a career long roll directed this delightful and endearing comedy about many kinds of love MOONSTRUCK is set in a never never land where the moon stays completely full three days in a row and everyone is Italian American and good at heart Loretta played by Cher is engaged to Johnny played by Danny Aiello But Johnny wants to hold off on the marriage for a month until his ailing mother in Sicily dies He is going to Sicily to be by his mother but leaves a request that Loretta invite his brother Ronny played by Nicholas Cage If you can t figure out what kind of problems that can cause you ought to hang it up But the plot is not as important as the beautiful yet economical characterizations Jewison has a talent like Louis Malle for creating a feeling that the viewer knows a character after just moments of screen time In one scene a woman is telling Loretta about the fickleness of men The woman tells her husband she sees a wolf in him He responds that he can still see the girl he married in her He has spoken one sentence on the screen and already he has won over the audience Jewison can charm magical performances from his actors He did it in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF and he does it here I personally have never been fond of Cher as an actress but if this were the only film I had ever seen her in I would anxiously be awaiting her next performance Vincent Gardenia on the other hand is a good actor and he too turns in one of his best performances And one more touch adding to the effect Like THE KILLING FIELDS A ROOM WITH A VIEW FATAL ATTRACTION and several other recent films MOONSTRUCK makes good use of the transcendentally beautiful opera music of Giacomo Puccini In this case the film is filled with the music of LA BOHEME
0235,Return of the Living Dead Part II,1988,Capsule review Entertaining but unimaginative retelling of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD with younger protagonists An occasional clever joke but in general a degradation of this branch of the series Rating 0 1 And now let us speak of the generations of the Living Dead Now Richard Matheson was mindful of the popularity of vampires that stretcheth back to Dracula and yes even unto Varney And he said I shall make me a modern vampire story And he took unto himself a typewriter and there was born a writing called I AM LEGEND And the fans looked upon I AM LEGEND and they dubbed it pretty good 2 Now I AM LEGEND begat three films in degrees that varieth And their names are INVISIBLE INVADERS THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN The two younger admitted their parentage but not the oldest The two older were meager of budget but not the youngest But it was the middle one THE LAST MAN ON EARTH than became the father of generations It starred Vincent Price and was made in the distant land of Italy 3 And it came to pass that in the land of Pittsburgh there dwelt a lowly maker of television commercials And his name was George Romero And Romero looked upon THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and sayeth unto himself Now there is how to make a horror movie for few pieces of silver And he spake unto John Russo saying Write me a script And in the fullness of time there was NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 4 But NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was poor of prospect and none had heard of it and fewer cared And it played only at theaters with big screens and no walls 5 And Roger Ebert looked upon it and his eye was offended And he took unto himself a typewriter and spake unto legions of his anger a very grievous error And the READERS DIGEST was among the legions who heard his lamentations and repeated his words unto hosts And the hosts repeated the words unto multitudes 6 And NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD prospered And John Russo took unto himself a typewriter and wrote the novel of the film 7 And in the fullness of time George Romero saw that there were multitudes who were mindful of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and he made DAWN OF THE DEAD And in the land of Italy DAWN OF THE DEAD was known by the name of ZOMBIE and multitudes had audience with it 8 And Lucio Fulci said Here is how to make a film for not many pieces of silver but which will call forth legions And he made ZOMBIE II And in the land of America there had been no ZOMBIE I so there ZOMBIE II was called ZOMBIE And in the lands of Italy and America there were legions of filmmakers who looked upon the prosperity And they had envy of audiences of multitudes and of the smallness of the investment And many made films like unto what they had seen 9 And John Russo looked upon the storm and lo he was wonderly wroth Had he not written the writing of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD And the courts said yes he did And lo did this not mean he could also make sequels But Romero said no he knew whereof he wanted the series to go But the courts spake unto Romero saying Give unto Russo equal right And he did 10 And John Russo took unto himself a typewriter and wrote a book called RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD And in the fullness of time he made him a film called RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD though it were not in the likeness of the book 11 And George Romero made a third Living Dead film DAY OF THE DEAD And it was released in a short span of days from RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD And audiences looked upon RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and many were well pleased But when audiences looked upon George Romero s DAY OF THE DEAD many said that his day was done 12 And John Russo was well used to writing novels from Living Dead films And yea it came to pass that he wrote a novel of the film RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and called it RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD And some fans and librarians were wonderly wroth and spake in anger saying One author cannot write two entirely different novels and give them but one title For lo many libraries are geared to the principle that if two novels have but one author they will have different titles And if two novels have but one title they will have different authors But John Russo turned his face from these people And in truth few libraries had either book 13 And it came to pass that RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD was popular unto its generation and it begat RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II 14 Let us speak now of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II and so that the ear of the mind not become weary let us lapse into modern English RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II is a bit like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD JUNIOR EDITION The story has been scaled sown so that two teens and one pre teen can be the heroes Jesse Wilson played by Michael Kenworthy is bullied by the older kids in the neighborhood Chased by two big kids he runs across a lost hermetically sealed canister containing a living dead corpse It is assumed you know from the previous film that the military has packed corpses from a nerve gas accident in these canisters and opening them will lead to a new plague of zombies Now Jesse knows there are some things boy was not meant to tamper with He is willing to leave the corpses alone but his two tormentors of course have all the sense that adults have in this film namely none Soon the cat s out of the bag the corpse s out of the canister and a bunch more from a nearby graveyard are climbing for higher ground The remaining story provides jolts but no surprises The horror content of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II is overly familiar the graveyard humor occasionally hits paydirt but not often enough To further confuse matters James Karen and Thom Mathews who died in the previous film but didn t realize it until hours later reprise almost identical roles with different character names and die again in just the same way The best way to make a sequel to a popular horror film is either to tell a different story or to tell the same story but tell it more creatively as EVIL DEAD II and to a lesser extent NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET III did RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II does neither but does succeed in putting its tongue further in its cheek than its predecessor did For the few good gags and it spite of gross out effects that give another sort of gags rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0236,Good Morning Vietnam,1987,Adrian Cronauer is a USAF DJ transferred from Crete to an early Vietnam police action 1965 This film is about his adjustment to Nam and Nam s adjustment to Cronauer The other characters include the General who brought him there his CO and NCO and his fellow DJs Cronauer also takes an off duty stint teaching English to get close to a Vietnamese girl Crete apparently lacking women There are run ins with terrorist bombs mines in the jungle new foods smiles from helping people in a different culture all the things which people join the Armed forces for Note since realism is being discussed there really is an Adrian Cronauer see the TIME review on this In some ways the film is kind of a downer mimic Robin Williams surfer voice There many amusing moments with Williams but these are short lived The problem is there are no good complementary antagonistic characters for Robin to bounce his lines off M A S H had the Frank Burns and Hot Lips characters to a minor degree Unlike M A S H Cronauer does not completely spoof the bureaucracy He s constantly put down by it My favorite scene in the film you have to see it no real spoiler is when Adrian being driven to the radio station gets caught in a traffic jam as troops are heading to the front This is Robin as his best GOOD MORNING VIETNAM appears like Bill Murray s attempt to cover some serious material as in THE RAZOR S EDGE This film will do well initially because of Robin William s following Too much is made of his comedy Perhaps he should have had a better hand with his writing I really like Robin Williams and have seen him live many times What s great about him isn t so much his comedy but his observations of the human condition I don t own any of his comedy albums because his visual coordination is important to his delivery This is also a problem in this film Williams has noted the problem himself between trained actor versus comic By far and away his best material is what s shown on HBO

0238,Serpent and the Rainbow The,1988,Capsule review American anthropologist is pulled into the world of voodoo and politics in Haiti during the fall of Duvalier Only in Haiti could a zombie story and a political thriller fit so well together The storyline gets muddled at times and cliched at others but this could have been a very good and a powerful film and just barely missed it Surprisingly solid effort from Wes Craven Rating 1 It has been a while since we have seen a real zombie film being made I do not mean the various imitations of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD The creatures in those films are usually called zombies or ghouls though they certainly are not zombies and they are just the opposite of ghouls But films about the voodoo reanimated dead have not been around much since the 1950s Now Wes Craven whose stock and trade used to be low budget films with weak stories and more recently has struck paydirt with the Elm Street films has made a true zombie film with the genuine gloss of a big budget production Big budget in this cases means actually filming in Haiti and the Dominican Republic and filling in at least the supporting roles with some impressive names names like Cathy Tyson of MONA LISA Broadway actor Zakes Mokae of MASTER HAROLD AND THE BOYS Paul Winfield and like a blast from the past Michael Gough A much less familiar Bill Pullman plays Dennis Alan a Harvard bred anthropologist who goes to Haiti to try and find a mysterious drug that makes people appear dead enough to be buried but leaves them alive Okay so maybe these are not true zombies either but the idea of a zombie fying drug has been around since the classic zombie film WHITE ZOMBIE perhaps even back to ROMEO AND JULIET In Haiti during the fall of Baby Doc Duvalier Alan finds himself enmeshed in a web of politics as well as voodoo In fact one of the points made by the script is that in Haiti religion politics and voodoo are inextricably intertwined As psychiatrist Marielle played by Tyson tells Alan Haiti is 80 Catholic and 110 voodoo As well as being a horror film THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW is in no small part a political thriller also Haiti is portrayed as being a sort of voodocracy in which most public officials practice the arts While the story is ultimately simplistic and disappointing it does paint a powerful portrait of a society in which public officials can threaten not only the body but also the soul Mixing church and state is bad enough when the mixture also includes a potent dose of destructive magic you have real trouble While this is a fantasy in which magic works the film s most frightening sequences depend only on people believing the voodoo not on the actual efficacy of the art And because voodoo really is believed in in Haiti these scenes may not be far from true For confused narrative and for the letdown of the cliched last five minutes I rate this film only a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale but I think somewhere deep down these really is some of the film that actors like Tyson and Mokae must have thought they were making
0239,Ironweed,1987,Well it s here I finally saw IRONWEED last night in a sneak preview in Albany for cast and extras It opens nationwide today 12 February First a warning Film reviews are subjective by definition This one will be worse than usual as I have a personal interest in the film It s the biggest thing to happen to Albany in years However I will do my best to be as objective as possible I saw the film with three other people two of whom were in the movie just as I was and I tried to listen carefully to their comments and integrate them with my thoughts IRONWEED is a good film It s not great but I think it s better than the general reviews indicate I found it to be well written brilliantly acted and powerfully moving The general story flow was surprisingly smooth The biggest problem is with editing The movie is too long 2 hours 16 minutes and there are obvious segments that should have been deleted However other scenes show signs of excess editing causing some confusion in the story line and many dangling subplots We finished filming in early summer and the film was released in mid December To me that seemed like not enough time to do a careful editing job Perhaps it was rushed to completion in time to be eligible for the 1987 Academy Awards IRONWEED is the story of Francis Phelan s return to Albany New York In 1901 Phelan was a trolley car worker for the Albany Traction Company During a strike Phelan throws a rock and kills a scab conductor To escape prosecution he leaves Albany for a year After he returns he attempts to build a life with his wife and children But he drops his 13 day old son Gerald on the floor killing him Phelan splits for good For the next several years Phelan wanders all over the US and Canada playing minor league baseball his rock throwing at the trolley strike was a preview of his throwing skills But the Great Depression hits and Phelan becomes just another of the millions of hungry boozing bums During these dreary years he takes up with Helen Archer a sickly but lovable homeless woman with a musical background Finally in 1938 Phelan returns to Albany to confront his past his family and the ghosts that populate his memories I think IRONWEED the movie is considerably superior to IRONWEED the book Although I m a big fan of William Kennedy s books I was quite disappointed with IRONWEED as a novel To me it was self indulgent overly experimental and difficult to wade through Most Albany readers seemed to enjoy it probably due to all the local references but a lot of non Albanians I ve talk to hate it I even know two people who took it back to bookstores and demanded their money back But Kennedy has done an excellent job with the screenplay The movie doesn t deserve the nickname Ironweird like the novel does Excising all the bizarreness of the novel Kennedy has managed to concentrate focus upon the main character Francis Phelan Despite numerous flashbacks Francis story flows from scene to scene with sparkling logic His character is strong and understandable Jack Nicholson s superb acting lifts Francis into a memorable film character Kennedy s handling of the ghosts from the past subplot is extremely clear in the film unlike Kennedy s rhetoric in his novel Hector Babenco s direction shows considerable understanding of this subject as well as it is not difficult to share the feelings of this powerful theme I originally felt that this subject should probably be dropped from the film but Kennedy showed how it can be done with clarity and conciseness Too bad he didn t take the same approach with his novel The best part of the novel was Phelan s confrontation with his family and the same can be said for the film In the novel s emotional climax Phelan accepts his wife s offer to move back home This is not as clearly or powerfully handled in the film but it is replaced with a scene of equal intensity Phelan reads a letter he received many years ago from his loving nine year old daughter who is now a grown woman filled with bitterness at Phelan s desertion of his family Phelan has kept the letter all these years and the quiet strength in Nicholson s voice as he reads the letter is an awesome performance that brought up the tears for me Kennedy has also lifted Helen Archer Francis girlfriend into a major character role I was concerned about this as Archer plays only a minor role in the novel But again Kennedy has changed the novel into the screenplay with amazing skill and taste And Meryl Streep as Archer shows the stuff that pros are made of You won t forget her performance for a long time When she belts out a tune in The Gilded Cage nightclub the audience on the screen and in the theater are both moved A couple of other outstanding performances were displayed by Tom Waits as Phelan s friend Rudy the Kraut and Carol Baker as Phelan s wife Both showed unusual skills in wide ranging roles and after the film I heard some comments that they d stolen the show A galaxy of other minor but colorful characters keeps flowing through IRONWEED making it a fun movie as well as a skillful look at life I think this is what makes the movie flow well despite its length IRONWEED doesn t seem long and doesn t really drag Still several subplots should have been removed Others needed to be expanded or better explained Parts of the story seem to have been nearly removed anyway and are left dangling such as the near seduction of Phelan as a teenager Throughout IRONWEED we see three ghosts but only two of them are ever explained I had no trouble following the story but I suspect that people unfamiliar with the novel might have difficulty due to the sometimes choppy editing Some audience members expressed confusion with several scenes and subplots Another subplot that begged for expansion was the one I was in Seriously Local residents and American Legion members the Raiders attack and burn down the shantytown where Phelan and Rudy are visiting friends In the six nights I worked on the film we produced an enormous number of spectacular and fascinating scenes Unfortunately they all seem to have been left on the cutting room floor As portrayed in the film the attack is confusing While working on the movie I watched a powerful Nicholson performance of Phelan s loyalty to his fellow bum Rudy That does not appear in the IRONWEED final product On screen the whole thing lasts about 60 seconds and is over before you can figure out what it is Some audience members asked me afterward what the heck was going on there The motivation for the Raiders attack simply was not there Incidentally I think I saw myself in one or two quick shots but I couldn t be sure since it went by so fast I ll have to watch it again a few more times and study it frame by frame when it comes out on video I can certainly see how movies go way over budget Babenco spent tremendous amounts of money on scenes that were barely used or cut out entirely A dead steam locomotive was shipped up from Mexico and altered at great expense yet appears only in a couple of non vital quick shots And of course I personally made several hundred dollars working on this movie yet my efforts ended up in the waste can along with that of hundreds of other Albany residents This film does an exceptional job with set decoration Albany area folks will have lots of fun spotting area localities as well as many Albany inside jokes in props signs and such It can get a little confusing for us at times though In one scene Phelan and Archer are examining a friend s body in Albany s South End They take a few steps and are suddenly in Troy about five miles away and across the Hudson River Phelan points back to Albany and mutters something about the body over there as if it s still a few steps away Troy Hudson and other local cities served as substitutions for various Albany neighborhoods in IRONWEED For now I ll give IRONWEED three stars I must admit that while watching the movie I spent too much energy trying to spot myself my friends and Albany landmarks After I see the film a few more times I may change my opinion but I suspect I may like IRONWEED even more Michael Trout miket brspyr1 UUCP brspyr1 miket BRS Information Technologies 1200 Rt 7 Latham N Y 12110 518 783 1161
0240,Throw Momma from the Train,1987,Sheesh I haven t written a movie review in four months and the Seattle Film Festival is coming up in three months Time to leap back in the middle of things and get a few comments out Decided to take a look at what s playing in the Friday paper and give you a quick run down on some of the stuff that s still playing BROADCAST NEWS To paraphrase Monty Python Witty James very very witty There are several awards I d like to see this film win come Academy Award time not that I hold out any hope that The Academy could pick a good film on its merits but best screenplay should really be reserved in advance I m one of those curmudgeons who found TERMS OF ENDEARMENT sloppy and over sentimental but Brooks seems to have learned his lesson in BROADCAST NEWS This film avoids making any of its characters stereotypes no Uncle Ben s off the shelf easily identifiable people icons here And of course the three main characters Hurt Brooks and Hunter take the entire film to even delineate I gave up trying to second guess anyone in this movie after the first fifteen minutes Do you have any idea how refreshing it is not to know what s going to happen next The actors are fine Brooks and Hunter come off a bit better because they have these amazing lines coming out of their mouth all the time as soon as things calm down I m going to go see BROADCAST NEWS a second time armed with a night light and a pen to write down quotes with Hurt comes off a bit cold but that is part of his character he seems to have sunk into his part which is about par for the course with him All in all I m wondering if Brooks can make another one like this if he does he might just find himself with a reputation as the current Lubitsch of Hollywood EMPIRE OF THE SUN Fantastic cinematography Skillful acting Beautiful music best thing John Williams has done and I love his SUPERMAN and COWBOYS type music Marvelous direction But ladies and gentleman children in the audience where the hell is the story This thing is about two and a half hours long and there is just not enough meat on the plot to feed one of those starving prisoners of war the film features Yes everyone is totally convincing but the characters are so underplayed that you never become intrigued with anyone in this film which leaves you as nothing more than a disinterested observer Hey that s probably how people react to being in a POW camp it may well be the most accurate unromantic view of how people live under this type of imprisonment But it leaves the audience to its own devices through much of the running length and you walk out with a surrealistic taste in your mouth A great movie for those of you who study the mechanics of film anyone looking for entertainment should search elsewhere HOUSE OF GAMES Let s face it no one actually talks like a real person in a David Mamet film or play I could argue THE UNTOUCHABLES either way Nobody talks like a real Dane in HAMLET either but you re not attending it to catch regional dialogue tips are you This film is built to fuck with your head and it does it beautifully you re never sure who s who in this film sometimes much like SLEUTH or DEATHTRAP but not nearly so contrived or if it is the contrivances are masked by the wonderful dialogue Joe Mantegna just walks away with the scenes he s in Lindsay Crouse while playing the victim turns out to be as much a mystery as Mantegna s character by the end of the film And that s as much of a tip as you re getting from me about the ending of the film You won t be disappointed believe me Tres entertaining tres engrossing One of my 10 best for 1987 THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN Not to start the back and forth Suck Rocks Tastes Great arguments that the net had about THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN but I saw it with great trepidation and was surprised to find myself really enjoying it It starts very slowly and the ending was never much of a surprise but there is some very inventive slapstick here and DeVito steals the show with a completely against type character a genuinely simple man who literally grows on one Everyone else is up to snuff if not exceptional and the script is fine THREE MEN AND A BABY Please I just ate I admit that it s better than the French version but that s like saying Lyndon LaRouche is a more palatable fascist than Adolph Hitler GOOD MORNING VIETNAM Frankly if you re going to watch Robin Williams rent the Live at the Met HBO tape While they let his character go here it s still a watered down version of his comedy act Other than the classroom scenes though none of the non comedy stuff held together very well or had any spice One or two great lines though and I did laugh like a crazy man through much of it Robin Williams is about the most immediately funny man I ve ever seen MOONSTRUCK Now these these are nice people They may bicker a little rub each other the wrong way ahhh but they re not the sitcom sludge that gets tracked into nice clean living rooms all across America These people got life feelings and they re sweet people You get caught up in this family immediately and if you re laughing at some of the circumstances that befall them you re hoping for a good outcome at the end too Have you gotten the point that I LIKE THIS MOVIE Good cause I did and if I d seen it in 1987 it would have been on the top 10 list no question Every frame in this film is made to let some very fine character actors and actresses have a ball and they take you along for the ride every step of the way Along with SUSPECT Cher seems to be picking films very well these days and even if THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK stunk it was still a prestige film prestige film any film with Jack Nicholson or Robert Duvall in it RAISING ARIZONA seems to have been the starting gun for Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter Hunter s work in BROADCAST NEWS is terrific and Cage is just as good in MOONSTRUCK Olympia Dukakis Danny Aiello and others are a pleasure to watch and Vincent Gardinia puts in his best performance in years he also has the film s best line which is saying something here and he delivers it with an absolutely perfect comic buildup Okay I hope he wins a best supporting actor nomination for that line Well that s taken care of What s on for this week Vat ist dis Action Jackson
0241,Whales of August The,1987,Cast Bette Davis Lillian Gish Vincent Price Ann Sothern Harry Carey Jr Frank Grimes Frank Pitkin Mike Bush Margaret Ladd Tisha Sterling and Mary Steenburgen Credits Directed by Lindsay Anderson Produced by Carolyn Pfeiffer and Mike Kaplan Written by David Berry based on his play Executive Producer Shep Gordon Director of Photography Mike Fash B S C Production Designer Jocelyn Herbert Music by Alan Price Editor Nicolas Gaster Art Directors K C Fox and Bob Fox Costume Designer Rudy Dillon When two screen legends like Lillian Gish and Bette Davis appear in a film together in a film like THE WHALES OF AUGUST it is virtually impossible not to take notice Between the two of them they have made over 200 films over more than 100 years of combined acting experience Ms Gish who is now 88 according to her started making films way back in 1912 when she and her sister Dorothy were introduced to D W Griffith who hired them immediately Ms Davis currently 79 years old has had no less a legendary career spanning more than 55 years in the film world The problem when stars of this caliber collaborate together at any age or point in their respective careers is of course that respect and admiration can easily degenerate into heroine worship While it is necessary to retain a healthy awareness and appreciation for the past each individual performance and film should be evaluated on its own merits Even accepting that premise however it is difficult to criticize THE WHALES OF AUGUST without appearing heartless or insensitive Given all the odds and barriers against such a film being made in the first place the fact that THE WHALES OF AUGUST was completed is a minor miracle in its own right And yet it has to be acknowledged that such a feat by itself isn t necessarily enough This film is more of a coda or a recapitualization of the careers of Gish and Davis rather than a crowning artistic triumph of the skills of two remarkable actresses While it is a sheer joy to see Gish and Davis back on the screen their return is less than satisfactory due to the failures of the narrative vehicle During the course of its 90 minutes the film continuously develops its premise and introduces its characters with dramatic conflict arising only in its final third The script adapted by David Berry from his own stage play concerns Sarah Ms Gish and Libby Ms Davis two elderly sisters who have spent the past 60 summers together without fail in the same house on an island near the coast of Maine Their favorite pasttime since childhood has been to watch for whales that appear each year late in the summer Their husbands have both died and their children have grown and established themselves elsewhere leaving Sarah and Libby to themselves Libby has become blind and her health is rapidly failing forcing her to rely on Sarah s attention Interestingly the character of the two sisters parallels to a striking degree the respective personality of Ms Gish and Ms Davis Just as Ms Davis has fought tooth and nail much of her way through Hollywood and Ms Gish has always been outwardly soothing and forgiving so too is the appropriately named Libby Strong an acerbic independent and abrasive companion to the the kindly Sarah Webber whose happy spirits are rarely perturbed After Sarah and Libby are first seen the supporting characters are introduced and developed one by one Vincent Price plays a Russian expatriate gentleman who is searching for a place to live since his landlady just recently died Ann Sothern plays Tisha Doughty a good friend of Sarah and Libby who used to watch for whales with them in their childhood Harry Carey Jr plays an oafish and clumsy carpenter friend who just can t avoid making noise every time he moves a limb With a plethora of scenes to describe their day to day activities fishing conversing and taking afternoon tea seem to be few delights left to them the filmmakers s introduction of the supporting cast into the flow of the film creates an intelligent and three dimensional depiction of the relatively isolated lives Sarah and Libby lead together on the island Ms Gish and Ms Davis both shine in their roles during these parts and although Ms Gish has considerably more screentime than Ms Davis their contrasting personalities complement each other quite well Their chemistry with the other actors is somewhat staid at a few points in the film but it is always believable and in several moments quite touching When Sarah cautiously leans over to pick up an item that has fallen on the floor it is almost heartbreaking to realize just how old and frail she really is and the toll caring for her sister must have taken Similarly when Libby is first seen she almost looks like a ghost with her long flowing white hair and dark blank eyes But instead of appearing frightening or startling Ms Davis makes Libby endearing and strangely sympathetic even as she macabrely brushes her cheek with a lock of her long deceased husband s hair However instead of simply letting this sensitive portrayal speak for itself the filmmakers decide to uproot the most fascinating aspects of their character study They make the all too typical mistake of trying to inject drama and plot into the course of events Libby keeps insisting to Sarah that their lives are over although ironically the very vehemence with which she makes this proclamation belies her fatalism and shows the life remaining behind those unseeing eyes Sarah to the other hand must decide whether she will reaffirm her commitment to care for her sister or whether she will leave Libby in the unwilling care of her rich daughter This conflict is however a wholly transparent one because both the filmmakers and the audience know that Sarah realizes what the only acceptable choice is Thus efforts to create suspense and drama simply unravel and fall flat The failure of the filmmakers approach is all the more striking since they completely separate the essential question facing Sarah and Libby from the other characters It is Libby and not Sarah or any other character who allows the conflict to be smoothly resolved The only event of substance influenced by a member of the supporting cast comes when Tisha assumes that Sarah wants to sell her house and asks a real estate agent to appraise the house This virtual irrelevance of the supporting characters to the drama reduces the conflict to a hackneyed obligatory and insulting level especially considering how roundly all of the characters are portrayed Director Lindsay Anderson and David Berry would have accomplished a great deal more if they had submerged the film s conflict into the character portrayal rather than bringing it to the forefront so clumsily On a technical level the film has a few minor errors For instance the lighting scheme during a nighttime scene is inconsistent from one shot to the next and in at least two instances the technical trickery used to overcome visual defects is apparent The first comes immediately after Sarah puts down a photograph viewer her head seems to lose its posture in slow motion as the camera cuts away The second comes in the form of what appears to be a few missing frames in the photographic negative not the positive print during a shot of Sarah lighting a candle for a dinner party The seam is slight but it is quite noticeable These are however relatively minor errors and the joy of seeing Ms Gish and Ms Davis back at work overcomes blemishes like these that do appear More worthy of comment is the filmic style of the director Mr Anderson is aware that the emphasis of this film is properly on the actors and he accordingly tones down the cinematic devices The result is quite conventional but surprisingly effective Particularly representative of this is the film s pre credit sequence in black and white It depicts Sarah Libby and Tisha in their childhood waiting and watching for whales on the same island The film then dissolves from a black and white image of a bell ringing buoy in the harbor to a full color image of the same bell more than half a century later This is a rather obvious technique but it manages to convey at once both the passage of time as well as the stability and calm of the island s unchanging features The rest of the film is photographed in the same restrained yet skillful style Even when the camera follows at the heels of Sarah as she walks across her front porch it does so only briefly Mr Anderson deserves credit for maintaining his sensitivity here something that could have easily been overlooked by another director Also noteworthy in the face of the creeping influence of video is his use of the entire 1 85 frame to full effect especially during the conversations in Sarah s living room What Mr Anderson deserves the most credit for however is for reuniting audiences with Ms Gish and Ms Davis Directing is hardly ever an easy task and Mr Anderson s courage at agreeing to direct a film fraught with so many possibilities for mishap must be recognized His film does offer many memorable pleasures which fans of these two legendary stars will no doubt appreciate Ms Gish and Ms Davis are two of the few remaining actors or actresses who warrant enough respect to enable audiences to indulge the glaring narrative faults of the film s script Still it is unfortunate that these two luminaries of the silver screen are forced to rely on their capital already deposited with audiences rather than demonstrating their considerable talents to a new generation of viewers It is only fair that Mr Anderson and Mr Berry bear the bulk of the responsibility for that failure as well as the lion s share of accolades for returning Ms Gish and Ms Davis to their fans Lindsay Anderson was born in India and educated at Oxford He advocated radical departures from traditional British filmmaking attitudes as co editor of the influential film magazine SEQUENCE Although he started making films completely by accident his documentaries and shorts have won awards and critical acclaim and his film IF won the Palm D Or at Cannes His previous films have dealt with violent upheavals and drastic changes in almost complete opposition to the stately and restrained style of THE WHALES OF AUGUST He greatly admires John Ford saying that In Ford there are tensions between tradition and independence which I recognize in myself
0242,Housekeeping,1987,Here in Seattle HOUSEKEEPING is being advertised first and foremost as a Bill Forsythe film images of his past works GREGORY S GIRL LOCAL HERO and COMFORT AND JOY are promoted in the trailers and you might well think that HOUSEKEEPING will be more of the same a slightly spacey gentle comedy It is spacey at times and there are prevalent elements of humor more of them towards the beginning but it is more of character study than anything Two young sisters are left with their grandmother before their mother commits suicide The two girls grow up in very small lumber town near Spokane until their grandmother dies when they are entering high school Then their aunt played with distracted charm by Christine Lahti moves into the house to take care of the girls However her casual undisciplined manner fails to provide much of a structure for the girls and the older sister begins to rebel against her Aunt s eccentricities she wants a more normal lifestyle The shyer younger sister Ruthie who is the narrator of the film finds her aunt more appealing and a friendship begins to develop after a time thus causing friction between the sisters who have only had each other to depend on before this As I said there is humor here Lahti s odd antics often bring out a smile But there is a lot of sadness here too and something of pain Ruthie s ostracization from her sister is particularly resonant And Forsythe tries to get in all sides of each of the characters one understands even accepts as valid the position of the elder sister and the townspeople while narrow minded are shown as primarily kindly which makes their final persecution more distressing In short I enjoyed this film greatly but would not recommend it to everyone I know those who are looking for a standard Forsythe comedy should look elsewhere If you don t mind a slow pace and can enjoy carefully crafted characters coming of age in a remote setting then I think you ll find it a rewarding film A question to those who read the book does it end so abruptly in the novel Please send E mail to me or put a SPOILER warning in the subject line so as not to spoil the ending for others Thank you
0243,Shoot to Kill,1988,If I were writing a syndicated column for THE NEW YORKER or FILM COMMENT I imagine I could have titled this review and that of HOUSEKEEPING printed elsewhere ecl two from the Pacific NorthWest since the majority of both films take place in the timberlines of west Washington state Warning Warning Will Robinson linking analogy approaching However since Pauline Kael has not suffered a massive stroke as of yet her review of THREE MEN AND A BABY left me with the impression that she had at least left the theater with huge throbbing veins sticking out of her neck and hence no vacancy at the NY I ll just admit that I saw the two films last week separated by a couple of days Frankly I ve had a bad time with TV and movie cops Growing up Under Mass Media almost all of them seemed to be inappropriate for the heroic policeman role most boys have somewhere in the back of their head Jack Webb was too dull and later too conservative Why do you think they call it dope son DUM DA DUMM DUMM along with the boys on ADAM 12 Steve Jack Lord McGarret appeared almost immediately pompous to me Gosh Steve you re always one step ahead of these guys That s why I ve got the big office Danno Columbo was great but can you imagine the good Lt protecting someone against several Mafia hit men And Dirty Harry was just a detective with a good aim and a bad attitude enjoying him was based on really disliking his opponents However there was one guy whose several appearances as a policeman impressed me as a young un an actor who played the type of detective that seemed in the best tradition of Holmes someone with great intelligence resolution and deductive abilities and the ability to pull the fat out of the fire in a tense situation While some of Sidney Poitier s appearances in detective films were more concerned with racial issues than crime thrillers i e his Mr Tibbs series IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT THEY CALL ME MR TIBBS THE ORGANIZATION he always portrayed a detective who was really dangerous he had brains Instead of twitching an eyebrow and muttering vengeance he d read the clues outsmart the villain and then blow him away in a perfectly legitimate shoot out Under control planning every move you could just hear his mind clicking away in the background Well he s back but not as Tibbs in SHOOT TO KILL and clicking away like crazy In the fine tradition of Waste His Ass movies everywhere Brief Definition A Waste His Ass movie is a film that shows a villain performing such heinous crimes during the first reel that the audience is heavily rooting for the hero to cream the villain i e Waste His Ass we have a really dangerous brutal criminal who gets FBI agent Poitier involved in a hostage situation and escapes Poitier tracks him down to I m required by state law to say this Beautiful northern Washington where he has joined a hiking fishing trip led by Kirstie Alley Alley s boyfriend Tom Beringer a mountain man sets out after them with Poitier in tow You can probably guess the rest Poitier does a good job as the FBI agent he justifies the hero role by deducing what s going on Beringer is fine as a foil to Poitier especially in the woods Alley s character though is lucky she s not dead after the second reel considering how she treats the killer I kept wanting to shout Use the Vulcan Neck Pinch Kirstie There are some other good elements the photography is inventive especially at the beginning of the film and the short mystery about which of the five fisherman on the trip is really the killer is pretty good I guessed wrong though if I d given it a little thought I would have come up with the correct answer And it s the first movie since MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL to have a Moose Trainer in the credits But it s overlong by the end of the film the manhunt has gotten tedious and the humor from Poitier s wilderness struggles are gone There are some real gapes in logic though not as many as the standard action pic is heir to and the soundtrack is annoying at time the scene with Poitier and Beringer climbing over the snow just cried for a narrator saying something like On and on further and further they trudged to their DESTINY because THE MOUNTIES ALWAYS GET THEIR MAN Conclusion overlong but redeemable with concessions However if you ever meet a grizzly bear in the woods do not attempt Mr Poitier s method of protection Talk about the magic of movies
0244,Switching Channels,1988,Although it was not highly publicized the new comedy SWITCHING CHANNELS had a not so sneak preview last night It stars Burt Reynolds Christopher Reeves and Kathleen Turner I went really expecting to be disappointed by a star vehicle and found myself enjoying it immensely This is not sophisticated comedy and I found myself comparing it more or less to a modern version of the 50s 60s love comedy movies All the characters are rather broad if not blatant caricatures but the actors did a good enough job that the characters worked The main story is a love triangle Why is it that everyone in a movie is involved in a love triangle and I have never known anyone in real life who was in a love triangle Don t I hang out with the right kind of people Kathleen Turner is a TV anchorperson She is concerned intense and very involved with her job Christopher Reeves is rich easy going and just a little self centered although this isn t immediately obvious Turner meets Reeves on vacation and decides to marry him and move to NYC where Reeves has gotten her a job as a morning talk show host the assumption in the film is that a talk show host is a real WIMP of a job for a hard hitting newsperson Her ex husband Burt Reynolds is her boss He plays one of his stock characters which he does very well He is the good old boy lovable scalliwag He does outrageous things in a way that let me ignore the fact that they were totally silly such as rushing to one of his gofers and shouting Call the Airlines Book every seat between here and New York for the next 24 hours Reynolds keeps trying to do things to separate Reeves and win Turner back for himself The badinage between Reeves and Reynolds especially when they first meet was very good As a backdrop and parallel plot Artie Johnson is about to be electrocuted for shooting a cop who sold his son drugs This is part of the comedy Really A race for Governor is going on in Illinois and the crooked politician is on the LAW and ORDER platform trying to win the race by getting the man electrocuted All the political characters are charicatures whether it is the Chicago machine politician the upscale rich and cannot think for himself Governor or the prison warden who is guilty of so many crimes that he is jerked backwards and forwards by practically everyone Along the way they do a send up of everyone in the news business from the brainless blond announcer to the vulture reporters who would just LOVE to film an electrocution live to the accuracy of their reporting Anyway if you are willing to suspend your disbelief over the impossibilities this should prove to be an excellent movie This is not HIGH ART but it has good characters and a lot of humor They even throw in some tension and a few chases for your 5 Go see this one if you like basic comedies
0245,Hairspray,1988,Film director John Waters has always pioneered his own distinctive brand of American cinema verite but his latest work HAIRSPRAY marks a radical departure from his earlier style Any film which is directed by John Waters has to be interpreted in its wider context without such a perspective the imagery can appear unusually frank HAIRSPRAY represents a big and I think unfortunate step towards mainstream Hollywood Ostensibly about a 1960 s teenage dance TV show HAIRSPRAY is based around a formative period in Waters own teen years As his recent book explains Waters has always felt vaguely alienated from society and he values every opportunity in his films to confront society with itself Waters films have always centered some would say obsessively on aspects of the human condition which polite people usually do not discuss in public HAIRSPRAY is different shunning overtness for commercial appeal it can be loosely characterized as a GREASE remake The plot is elemental concerning the triumph of good over evil of substance over style of character over the superficial The casting is excellent placing such untalented no hopers as Debbie Harry Pia Zadora and Sonny Bono in undemanding roles well suited to their abilities Longtime Waters fans will be treated to a double appearance of Divine in the normal housewife role and most surprisingly dressed as a man realistically depicting a 300 pound redneck TV station manager And look out for Waters own cameo appearance as a manic psychiatrist wielding such essential aids to modern medical diagnosis as the spinning disk and the cattle prod Directors often become boring or mawkish when they film autobiographically For example consider the last half dozen Woody Allen films It s because they wrongly assume that the audience will love the subject as much as they do Waters veers near to committing this error here and it is unlikely that HAIRSPRAY will be well received by the same people who revered his earlier works such as PINK FLAMINGOS or FEMALE TROUBLE It just doesn t have the inventiveness of POLYESTER Lacking the ferocity of Fassbinder or the triteness of Andy Warhol but sharing the sexual ambivalence of both John Waters has for the past 20 years been an enfant terrible within the American film industry With this latest film he is declaring his future direction to be unashamedly Hollywood bound But it s a long way from Baltimore to Sunset Boulevard and unless Waters is careful he s liable to end up where he s headed
0247,Frantic,1988,Richard Walker played by Harrison Ford is in Paris for a medical convention He banters with his wife on the way to the hotel checks in and takes a shower When he comes out of the shower his wife seems to have stepped out Room service brings in an ordered breakfast and Walker eats it and takes a nap When he wakes up still no wife He goes to the lobby to look for her One by one he checks out possibilities of what could have happened to her Soon his worst fears are confirmed He learns that she has been kidnapped The police are surly the American authorities can do nothing Walker has to take matters into his own hands This is not too original a plot and in truth much of FRANTIC has a ring of familiarity In some ways it follows the classic style of a Hitchcock thriller The one word title the innocent bystander hero a genuine McGuffin even rooftop struggles Where it strays from being Hitchcockian is in its nearly humorless approach and its cold fish hero Harrison Ford is nowhere near a personable one as a Cary Grant or a James Stewart That makes the acting a few steps closer to reality but the viewer is left to guess what the character must be feeling rather than feeling with the character We are drawn to Harrison Ford but at arm s length With Hitchcock and the right actor we would actually be living the adventure with the character On the other hand with most Hitchcock films it would be easier to pick holes in the plot Even a VERTIGO has a plot that entirely hinges on a man recognizing a specific Spanish villa from a description from somebody s dream Following the initial events that set the action of FRANTIC in motion events follow a suspenseful but logical course The major unexplained point of the film is how an action that was not intended to be a kidnapping and seemingly could easily have avoided being turned into one was so botched Ford s search for his missing wife takes him to if not Paris s underbelly at least somewhere below Paris s waist His best clue leads him to Michelle a sinuous drugged punker played by Emmanuelle Seigner who provides a somewhat less innocent bystander to the plot and provides the attractive female lead required in any Roman Polanski directed film As a cliche buster however Walker reacts with total disinterest to Michelle s attempts at seduction First last and always he is in this to get back his wife played by Betty Buckley who played a sympathetic teacher in CARRIE a sympathetic mother in EIGHT IS ENOUGH and an unsympathetic singer in TENDER MERCIES FRANTIC is a surprisingly straightforward thriller from director and co scripter Roman Polanski who is usually known for for more convoluted and psychological storylines Rate it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0248,Vice Versa,1988,Capsule review Father and son trade bodies in what seems an unpromising comedy fantasy but which breathes new life into into an old concept VICE VERSA compares favorably with the Thorne Smith fantasy comedies of the 1940s Judge Reinhold s and Fred Savage s acting is very much on target Rating 2 Thorne Smith was the master of the sophisticated supernatural comedy Back in the 1920s and 1930s he wrote a series of sophisticated comic novels including THE PASSIONATE WITCH and NIGHT LIFE OF THE GODS though his best known series were the Topper books Hollywood 1940s comedy fantasies including TURNABOUT I MARRIED A WITCH and the Topper series were based on his novels TURNABOUT involved the comic effects of a man and a woman who somehow trade minds The same idea of variations has been tried in films with uneven results Not too long ago there was a reputedly terrible film on this theme called LIKE FATHER LIKE SON in which a father and son change places Dudley Moore played first the father then the son It appeared to be one more step down in Moore s career which has been spotty since the hilarious BEDAZZLED Now perhaps too soon afterwards another film has come out on the same theme and this one I must say is worthy of the Thorne Smith tradition Seymour Marshall played by Judge Reinhold in one of his first adult roles is an executive for a large department store who through a smuggling slip up has come into possession of a magical skull from Tibet While caring for his son while his ex wife is on vacation he whimsically wishes to trade places with his son Charlie played by Fred Savage For once whimsey does make it so Now such a plot can be and has been done well or poorly VICE VERSA does it about as well as it can be done Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais who produced the script the film as well as wrote the script have really creative imaginations for comic situations The result is a story that is not just cute but genuinely very funny The film s only real false step is to mix in a cliched subplot with criminals and chases but it remains a small part of the plot and even it is resolved in a novel manner The acting is surprisingly good by both Reinhold and Savage who play the father and son or VICE VERSA under the direction of Brian Gilbert Each has a feel for the mannerisms of the other Savage is staid and dignified with a dominant edge Reinhold s eleven year old boy is sloppy and explosive with a great feel for physical comedy Savage as the father pretending to be the son finds seventh grade a breeze but dealing with seventh grade bullies takes more than just an enlightened mature approach Reinhold s little boy as department store executive dealing with what he calls yin yangs and what the credits call the backstabbers has a winning ingenuous quality VICE VERSA was a very pleasant surprise Rate it a low 2 on the 2 to 4 scale
0249,Good Morning Babylon,1987,Capsule review At last the untold story that film historians have been waiting for the mammoth epic story of how the elephants were sculpted for the Babylon set of INTOLERANCE and the tragic story of the men who devoted their lives so that you and I might have better elephants A slightly overdone Italian film about the early days of Hollywood Rate it a slightly bemused 2 Right now you are probably asking yourself why it is that it was the United States and not Italy that for so many years dominated the international film market even after that great Italian masterpiece of 1913 CABIRIA directed by Giovanni Pastione Well Italian directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani have brought the whole sordid story of how two poor brothers from Italy saved Hollywood by sculpting the elephants for the Babylon set of D W Griffith s INTOLERANCE Ah yes What a gripping tale it is as two young architect sculptors find themselves out of work in Italy and come to the United States only to find that they can be employed only as pig herders But talents like theirs cannot remain hidden long and soon they become plasterers for the great San Francisco Exposition Meanwhile D W Griffith sees CABIRIA and is stunned It is greater than anything he ever did How can an American hope to compete with the great Italian film industry And what impressed D W the most The great stone elephant D W cancels his current film He must make a film with stone elephants But where can he find someone with talent enough to sculpt truly great elephants In the nick of time he sees the Italian architecture at the San Francisco Exposition and asks to get the same geniuses But the boys troubles are not over yet They still must overcome genuine intolerance before they can achieve their destiny and sculpt the elephants for the Babylon set of the film INTOLERANCE Their troubles aren t even over when on the premiere night of INTOLERANCE D W Griffith cannot accept the applause of the audience He defers the credit to where it is really due to the two Italian boys who sculpted the elephants for the Babylon set Then destiny separates the brothers only to bring them together once again on a World War I Italian battlefield where dying together too weak to struggle to get help they find strength enough to film each other dying Their last effort is to leave a lasting momento for the kids at home and all those legions of fans of the stone elephants in the Babylon set of INTOLERANCE Believe it or not GOOD MORNING BABYLON was not a comedy And the same directors did the very fine NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS Harlan Ellison can rest easy Somebody finally made a sappier film about Hollywood than his film THE OSCAR Rate this one a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Oh an historical note CABIRIA did make something of a splash at the time and had one indelible effect on the Italian film industry This 1913 film introduced the character Machiste who has returned in countless Italian strongman films Many times his name shows up as Atlas or Samson or Goliath in the English translation but in Italian it was Machiste

Editor Emmanuelle Castro Production Manager Gerald Molto Music Schubert Moment Musical No 2 Saint Saens Rondo Capricioso Violin Ami Flammer Piano J F Heisser Every detail of the events on January 15 1944 has become etched into Louis Malle s memory On that tragic day an 11 year old Louis Malle and his fellow students in a Catholic school fifty miles south of Paris watched as the local Gestapo chieftain arrested three of their Jewish classmates along with Father Jacques the school s headmaster who had hidden the Jewish boys for over a year Now more than forty years later after the Nazis sent the four to their deaths Louis Malle shares this most intimate and troubling memory of his childhood in his newest film AU REVOIR LES ENFANTES GOODBYE CHILDREN which he wrote produced and directed No other filmmaker in recent memory has bared his or her soul to the bone more movingly and more convincingly than Louis Malle has done in this film By focusing his film only on the specific events he witnessed that led up to that fateful day Louis Malle s film becomes the rarest of rarities a film that is intensely personal and deeply moving yet does not degenerate into vacuous melodrama or political polemic The simple and unrelenting honesty of his film transforms Louis Malle s personal catharsis into an experience of universal and profoundly human dimensions Literally the title refers to the farewell that Father Jacques renamed Father Jean in the film utters to the students as he s being led away by the Germans but metaphorically it heralds the end of Louis Malle s own childhood innocence Through the eyes of Julien Quentin Gaspard Manesse Louis Malle depicts his introduction to the harsh realities from which his upper middle class background had sheltered him The loss of innocence begins in the very first scene as Julien prepares to board the train that will take him to the school He can t stand the thought of leaving Paris and he tells his mother that he hates her for making him go Her response is to hug and kiss him It is a poignant moment but Julien s outburst points to the tensions that have already been created within him by the war tensions that will develop and express themselves later From there the film shifts to the school itself where Julien forgets about the outside world and goes about being a studious and playful seventh grader He reads novels after hours with a flashlight plays pranks on other children and cavorts on stilts in the schoolyard during recess During these scenes Louis Malle creates an almost perfect aura of boarding school life complete with the children s token adherence to religious rituals and gripes about the food being good only when parents come to visit By relying on the natural responses of his young actors Malle captures youthful bravados and mannerisms with the same astounding resonance of Francois Truffaut s THE 400 BLOWS and indeed a scene of the schoolchildren marching through the streets creates a powerful sense of deja vu What primarily distinguishes Louis Malle s depiction from the spate of recent coming of age films however is that Julien is neither a child claiming to be an adult nor an adult pretending to be a child When the three young boys arrive at the school one of them Jean Bonnet Raphael Fejto is assigned the bed next to Julien s Julien acts just as a typical tough kid would he introduces himself by saying I m Julien Don t mess with me But while he joins in the boys pranks and teasing Julien also finds himself intrigued by the quiet reserved manner in which Jean bears all the abuse Little by little a shaky friendship with numerous ups and downs develops between them Their friendship becomes cemented when the two find themselves lost in the woods as they search for a treasure during a scouting game Frightened and cold they are found on a highway by three soldiers on patrol in a jeep who return them to the school What Julien can t understand is why Jean tried to run when he realized that the soldiers were German After Julien discovers that Jean s real last name is Kippelstein he eventually realizes that Jean is Jewish but even then has to ask his brother what it means to be Jewish Julien is now at a seminal point in his maturity where he cradles an already emerging adult awareness with his yet potent youthful exuberance Louis Malle s heartfelt construction of this child adult balance is at the core of the film s success By the end of the film the viewer does not merely sympathize with the two boys as the Gestapo make their arrests at the school Rather the audience empathizes so thoroughly with the two boys experience that their ordeal becomes the viewer s as well The film s final shots convey the full emotional weight of the bond between Julien and Jean that has been so sharply cut but those shots do not degenerate into tearjerker sentiment because the audience feels the hurt caused by the arbitrariness and extent of the Nazi s evil as though it had been aimed personally against the viewer Few films manage to link its characters with the audience so closely as Malle s convincing and even handed portrayal of the array of human weaknesses and strengths And Malle gives the film a tremendous thematic scope to the film as well as depth which contributes further to Julien s loss of innocence Joseph Francois Negret an orphan who works in the school s kitchen runs a black market where the children can trade their food from home for cigarettes and dirty books When the scam is discovered Joseph is fired while the students who collaborated with him are merely reprimanded due to their family prestige Joseph repays this acknowledged injustice by the same act that Louis Malle explored in his 1974 film LACOMBE LUCIEN and it is just as inexplicable and appropriate here as it was in that film Julien cannot believe his eyes when he discovers what his friend has done In another scene Jean Bonnet joins Julien and his family for a Sunday lunch outing While they are eating two French militiamen enter and begin to harass an elderly distinguished gentleman who is in the restaurant illegally While most of the patrons grumble some support for the gentleman it is none other than a Nazi officer who seizes the initiative and throws the militiamen out The enormous moral implications about the acquiescence to evil begin to dawn on Julien and the audience when a surprised diner s exclamation that not all Germans are bad is immediately followed by a cynical comment that the Nazi officer was really just grandstanding in front of Julien s attractive mother Jean meanwhile remains still as a mouse he s seen it all before and he displays virtually no sign of how quietly desperate his life has become It is through repeated scenes such as these that Louis Malle establishes unique and moral complexities within which Julien comes of age Watching Julien explore these contradictions is never tiresome even though the audience knows in advance the inevitable outcome because of the natural and believable ensemble performances Louis Malle likes to work with inexperienced young actors and in this film he draws upon their natural inclinations and reactions so masterfully that the distinction between actor and character is erased Louis Malle s film creates not a flat stage for the actors to work on but rather a fully articulated and three dimensional world for the characters to inhabit and live in The balance between the narrative and its context is impeccable It is quite fortunate that Louis Malle waited all these years to make this film because the perspective gained from that experience enabled him to crystallize all his humanity and all his filmmaking skills into a solid film that defies trivialization or dismissal And because he has fictionalized certain scenes and details while remaining thoroughly true to what he calls the most tragic memory of my childhood his film involves the audience in a manner that no documentary or polemic could hope to equal Louis Malle has shown that despite the staggering amount that has been written already there yet remains much to say and remember about the horrors of the Nazi era One has to return to THE GRAND ILLUSION THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the films of Ingmar Bergman and Satyajit Ray to find similarly moving portraits of the human condition A film like AU REVOIR LES ENFANTES arrives only rarely a precious event that will be remembered for years to come by those who witness its birth
0252,Hairspray,1988,The death of Divine was made all the more untimely by his two err de farce performances as both the bad guy and the heroine s hefty mother in HAIRSPRAY While the young actress who plays his daughter is frighteningly good in her role Divine dominates and sets the tone for one of the most enjoyably silly movies I ve seen in ages Director John Waters serves up what may be the best 1962 movie ever made This is what I call Hang Ten filmmaking many of the scenes are right out on the edge without tripping over themselves The soundtrack is easily the finest of its genre it s impossible to tell which idiotic novelty numbers were written for the film and which were genuine Sixties issue The art direction repleat with 65 536 colors not found in nature compliments the bright saturated photography Some Some Try most of the wardrobe in this film will have you simultaneously laughing and reaching for the Dramamine If you manage to retain your higher brain functions while slapping your knee you just may notice a surprising amount of depth I mean in the film not the hairdos While many movies shoot themselves in the foot trying to deliver The Message ignoring Sam Goldwyn s advice about Western Union HAIRSPRAY deftly pokes fun at The Message and still manages to deliver it Of course there isn t a moment of doubt about where the film s sympathies lay It just doesn t go overboard in that department The greatest strength of the film is the casting It s perfect I mean there isn t a character out of place anywhere Besides the formidable presence of the late Divine we have Jerry Stiller as his husband Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry as the White parents of The Spoiled Brat and Pia Zadora in her best performance ever with Rick Ocasek in a cameo Even Waters himself shows up as the technically up to date psychiatrist He has described this group as a dream cast and explained that you don t ask for a Sonny Bono type you ask for Sonny Bono The budget for HAIRSPRAY may be high for John Waters but he clearly knows his craft well enough to deliver a lot of bang and hairspray for the buck If you have any memory at all of beehives cars with fins or line dances then by all means check this out If you choose not to see HAIRSPRAY the Council will see it as a character flaw and not let you in the club
0253,Wizard of Speed and Time The,1988,Those of us cursed with the occasional desire to go to science fiction conventions have had the opportunity over the past ten years to see filmmaker Mike Jittlov s work usually in one and a half hour blowouts that leave one staggering To my mind Mike Jittlov is the greatest stop motion animator who ever lived Harryhausen notwithstanding His only problem is that he insists on complete control over every aspect of what he does to the point of learning to sing in stop motion so that his sound track could not be replaced since the lip motion couldn t be edited out He s also next door to certifiable but in Hollywood this is not a handicap Last weekend there were two preview showings of his first full length feature THE WIZARD OF SPEED AND TIME This is a film well worth seeing whether or not you are familiar with Jittlov s work It shows signs of having been made on a shoestring and there are a large number of industry in jokes but all in all it s a fun serio comic romp through Hollywood In essence it s the autobiographical story of the making of the short film of the same name and it does prove Jittlov s main point he s a complete filmmaker not just an effects man There s a considerable amount of Hollywood union bashing going on here which is not going to win Jittlov any friends in the industry That s why this film is being previewed at this time The American Film Market festival is currently underway in Los Angeles where independent films looking for distributors are screened citywide Readers will never see this film unless it is picked up and I hope for the sake of the independent filmmakers that it is It has its flaws in execution and otherwise but it gives value for money Both preview shows were sold out If it is distributed lovers of movies should see it It s true to life and fun That combination is rare these days

Bruce Myers Pavel Slaby Pascale Kalensky Jacques Ciron Anne Lonnberg Laszlo Szabo Vladimir Valenta Clovis Cornillac Leon Lissek Consuelo de Haviland Credits Directed by Philip Kaufman Produced by Saul

Roth Production Design Pierre Guffroy Original music and arrangements by Mark Adler Musical selections from the works of Leos Janacek Upon examining the list of credits for this film bells and lights should be going off in every direction Saul Zaentz AMADEUS ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST produced The film was shot by Sven Nykvist the painter with light who has won universal praise for his work with Ingmar Bergman and other directors The film was edited under the watchful eye of Walter Murch who won Oscars and acclaim for his editing and sound work in films like APOCALYPSE NOW THX 1138 and THE CONVERSATION The cast is a potpourri of prominent and excellent actors from England Czechoslovakia France Sweden and Holland The director Philip Kaufman is American he s known mainly for the 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE RIGHT STUFF Finally the script is based on the internationally reknowned novel written in 1984 by Milan Kundera a Czechoslovakian expatriate living in France Seeing the list of all that high power talent is almost enough to make the breath quicken and the mouth water the potential for greatness seems ready to explode in an artistic flowering Then the intrigue of the subject matter arises just what is a film with a title like The Unbearable Lightness of Being about One borrows a copy of the novel from a friend to satiate the desire to know On a strict narrative level it turns out that the book concerns the erotic liaisons between a brilliant brain surgeon in Czechoslovakia named Tomas his wife Tereza and his mistress Sabina as well as Sabina s lover Franz But this is no trashy Harlequin Romance Their romantic exploits are set against the 1968 Soviet invasion of their homeland which abruptly terminated the newly found artistic and political freedoms during the period of socialism with a human face known as the Prague Spring But then an unpleasant realization sinks in The path from the novel which quite deserves all the praise it has been given to a film is fraught with many possible missteps Why Because interspersed within the romance and politics are Kundera s numerous philosophical asides and metaphysical discussions which form the real core and gem of the novel Consider this excerpt from Part Two which is entitled Body and Soul Even in this abridged passage one can see how deftly Kundera integrates his ruminations with his character s actions That is what gives the novel and its title substance and depth no other novel in recent memory about the travails of young lovers begins with a three page reflection on Nietzchean idea of eternal return and Parmenides division of the world into pairs of opposites And Kundera s remarkable word choices and striking juxtapositions elevate the novel to its proper place as a great work of modern literature But therein lies the problem with the film any filmmaker no matter how talented will most likely be at a loss as how to transfer the full richness of the above excerpt to the filmic medium The best one can probably hope for is an intelligent and sensitive recounting of the narrative in a manner that remains faithful to the more metaphysical aspects of the book While Ingmar Bergman or Alain Resnais HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR might be the first choice to guide the novel to the screen Philip Kaufman and his actors leave no doubt that they have made as good a film as possible from as unfilmable a novel as this Unfortunately the film leaves one hanging for more Perhaps the best scene in which this becomes evident is the scene near the beginning after Tereza has just unexpectedly arrived at Tomas apartment in Prague As she and Tomas make love for the first time she screams loudly in his ear In the book the scream was not an expression of sensuality What was screaming is fact was the naive idealism of her love trying to banish all contradictions banish the duality of body and soul banish perhaps even time In the film however all one hears is Tereza shouting for a second or so There is no indication whatsoever of the metaphysical significance of Tereza s screams This is indicative of how straightforward the narrative has been made in the film and it is painful to sit through knowing that so much is lacking on the screen The book s central categorization of all things into heavy and light and Kundera s constant exploration of the boundaries of the two is so subdued in the film as to be virtually absent Yet what remains on the screen does have strengths of its own The acting in the film is uniformly superb from Daniel Day Lewis as Tomas French actress Juliette Binoche as Tereza and noted Swedish actress Lena Olin as Sabina down to the few moments the popular Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski has onscreen as an Interior Ministry official who tries to convince Tomas to recant an article critical of the communists that Tomas had written years before Kaufman draws thoroughly on the skills of his actors and there is no mistaking that this most American of directors has successfully produced a quintessentially European character study Technically the film is dazzling in several moments In one scene Tereza hallucinates while swimming in a pool that the row of women exercising at the poolside have been replaced by a grinning Tomas forcing the now nude women to do squat thrusts The camera shows the women from Tereza s point of view as she alternately surfaces and dives into the water The crisp colors and the sharp seamless editing between the real and the unreal as the camera bobs above and below the water surface makes up in visual appeal for the loss of the inner meaning explained in the book of Tereza s hallucination Also the sequence in which Tereza and Tomas photograph the Soviet tanks and troops as they roll into Prague is a breathtaking cinematic tour de force Kaufman and his crew brilliantly integrate archival footage with their own recreation of the Russian invasion complete with authentic clothing props automobiles and tanks Daniel Day Lewis is even provided with a gold tooth crown that was popular among Czech men at the time Kaufman s crew maintained such a high degree of accuracy that Kundera who lived through the invasion could not distinguish archival footage of the invasion from scenes of Kaufman s recreation During this sequence Kaufman integrates virtually every technical aspect of filmmaking lighting photography editing sound color art direction acting with such astonishing clarity that the sheer cinematic strength of those scenes carries the film in a direction the book never could have And the narrative does manage to include some of Kundera s philosophical gems In one dinner table conversation Tomas castigates those who initially welcomed the communist regime for not following the mythical example of Oedipus who says Tomas at least had the courage to punish himself by gouging out his eyes and leaving home when he realized that he had killed his father and slept with his mother Kaufman also deserves accolades for the caring sensitivity with which he brings the nudity and eroticism of the book to the screen That Kaufman manages to avoid cheap exploitation in an industry that revels at every opportunity to increase box office appeal is in of itself a major accomplishment Unfortunately by the end of the film s 168 minutes all of the film s inner strengths fail to compensate for the loss of the inner secrets of Kundera s novel Kundera himself has said that If the novel has a function it is to discover the ambiguity of things My obsession as a novelist is to transform all answers into questions That ambiguity is sadly missing from the screen translation Kaufman had the blessing of Kundera s intimate involvement and approval of the choices he made while writing the script and Kaufman also benefited from Kundera s experience with filmmaking Kundera was once a professor at the Prague National Film School where Milos Forman was among his students With all the talent involved in the making of this film Kaufman has achieved what to him must be a supreme personal triumph Nevertheless it is disappointing that one must be familiar with Kundera s novel to fully appreciate the qualities that made the story of Tomas Tereza Sabina and Prague so memorably special As is undoubtedly apparent from the filmography THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING is a departure from the material that Philip Kaufman has previously worked on except perhaps for his 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe s bestseller His films have only recently begun to attract critical attention
0255,Stand and Deliver,1987,Capsule review What kind of a film would appeal both to the Hispanic community and to mathematicians The true story of a math teacher who fights to make mathematicians out of barrio kids This plot has been done dozens of times as a fictional sports story but rarely this well and rarely with a subject that has the immediate appeal that calculus does Rating 2 American Playhouse produces quality feature length films primarily to be shown on PBS Rare is the year that they have not made a film that deserves to be at least nominated for Best Picture though to the best of my knowledge they have never received any such nomination Some of their better work is released to theaters though whether it is produced with that market in mind I do not know However their films TESTAMENT and EL NORTE did get shown in theaters well before going to television Their current release is STAND AND DELIVER You have probably seen before the plot of the losing team and the coach who uses unorthodox techniques and understanding to build the team into champions Things are different here First this is a true story and second we are not talking about football or basketball we are talking about calculus This is the story of how a math teacher in a barrio school fought to take students who had a hard time learning fractions and turn them into some of the country s top scorers in the advanced college placement tests Edward James Olmos plays Jaime Escalante who is willing to play clean or hit below the belt to taunt his students to make something of themselves His classes are peppered with under the breath and over cutting remarks about math and life in the barrio Tough guys don t need math Tough guys fry chicken for a living I guess that STAND AND DELIVER shows one of my childhood fantasies actually coming true I always thought that if even the school toughs found out what math was really like it would become the cool thing in the school to be really into math much like it really was for football This film actually shows that in one very unlikely school math did become the in thing But I guess what I find most amazing is that the film was made at all I mean it s one thing to sell a kid from the barrio on the idea that math is nifty There is intelligence there you can appeal to But to sell calculus to a film producer is something else again This fine film could have been sold only to something like American Playhouse Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0256,D.O.A.,1988,For those of you who sort of liked FRANTIC s idea style normal guy in jeopardy plot but didn t feel compelled to write in a story during the boring execution of the film the new movie D O A should be most welcome The story revolves around Dexter Cornell portrayed by Dennis Quaid He plays a burned out English professor at a large southern university the movie was filmed in Austin Texas Early in the film he manages to swallow a rare fatal slow acting 24 48 hours to live poison phosphorous chloride during a drinking binge To make it worse his wife is murdered and he s the prime suspect The rest of the movie is dedicated to him trying to figure out who s trying to ruin his day D O A succeeds everywhere that FRANTIC failed It has a good story Good pacing It has more sophisticated commentary and humor It has a much more imaginative visual style Quaid to me is a much more believable everyman than Ford in this role at least I generally like Ford s performances and displays a greater acting range ever notice how Ford seemed to only have one expression pained during FRANTIC In short it s a true mystery rather than a travelogue We re given a cast of suspects and are led along a fairly logical process of deduction None of the fantastic gaps of credibility that plagued FRANTIC including the worst that Ford s character would go out on his own after such a short time My only gripe is that the ending should have had more punch
0257,Hairspray,1988,The world is coming to an end cracks are forming in the Earth s surface mountain sized chunks of ice are falling from the sky John Waters has made a family film oceans are boiling over Well one out of four is actually true And I know which one you probably think is true but you re wrong No as unlikely as it seems John Waters has made a family film This is the same John Waters who made PINK FLAMINGOS in which super obese transvestite Divine eats what the doggie leaves behind and I don t mean leaves behind in the dish And gang it wasn t trick photography and a Tootsie Roll It was done so lucky audiences could tell it was the real thing Since then and until Divine s recent death Divine has appeared in most if not all of Waters s films perhaps indicating that Waters has some sort of conscience though more likely indicating that Waters s gross out film require the services of someone who will do just about anything for money Waters s films are mostly about bad taste Of late Waters has been trying a new formula to make more profitable films Most of his films have become cult classics but have had small audiences because of their subject matter and in particular their X rating But Waters has long known that all bad taste need not be scatological He made the R rated POLYESTER and now the PG rated HAIRSPRAY As part of the new formula Waters intentionally picks out acting talent that most of his viewing audience considers to be a joke POLYESTER featured along with Divine Tab Hunter HAIRSPRAY features Sonny Bono Pia Zadora Jerry Stiller and Debbie Harry In 1962 Baltimore nearly everybody watches THE CORNY COLLINS SHOW a sort of locally produced version of American Bandstand The politics of choosing what teenagers will be dancing on the show reflects the politics of the time There is a power structure determining who will show up as a dancing teenager on the program and making sure that blacks show up only on the once a month blacks only show The story is about two teens vying for the Number One spot and about the people trying to keep the show segregated against those trying to integrate the show And it is all done with a bizarre but not all that exaggerated view of the fashions and hair styles of 1962 Waters finally has a film that could have mass appeal Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0258,18 Again!,1988,A couple of weeks ago I reviewed VICE VERSA and I said that the plot of personalities trading bodies had been done before often and usually not very memorably In fact FREAKY FRIDAY an early Jodie Foster film made for Disney came to mind though I had seen only trailers for it But I am sure I have seen the theme elsewhere it is just the films were so forgettable Now two weeks later I have seen another treatment of the same story and this one is really forgettable The film is 18 AGAIN and take my word for it it is one time too many David Watson played by newcomer Charlie Schlatter has more than his share of problems He is pledging at a fraternity and is being picked on by his frat brothers The girl he secretly loves goes with his chief tormentor David is expected to join the dull business of phonemaking owned by his grandfather Jack Watson played by George Burns Jack has only one problem he wants to be 18 again like David Through a birthday wish gone wrong Jack finds himself in his grandson s body Schlatter spends most of the rest of the film doing a George Burns impression Jack then brings his own philosophy of self confidence to straightening out his grandson s life from inside the grandson s body While VICE VERSA brought a fresh eye and a clever sense of humor to the trade of personality plot 18 AGAIN drags through every predictable cliche at half the pace that Mr Burns walks The script totally sidesteps the plot of the boy in the old man s body and shows you only the old man in the boy s body and even so it does considerably less with that plot than VICE VERSA does with less screen time The story does virtually nothing new with the idea There is however one good piece of advice in the film As David s chief tormentor is getting ready for a race with our hero he tells him Don t waste your time Let me pass that advice on to you Rate 18 AGAIN a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0260,Unbearable Lightness of Being The,1988,Capsule review THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING is not a light film but it is by no means unbearable either Philip Kaufman who makes very entertaining films makes one that only sounds like an exception 171 minutes of solid entertainment with a title you can use to impress your friends Rating 3 It certainly sounded like it was going to be a drag THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING You can expect a bad time from a film whose title is sort of verbal fruit cocktail It sounds like an obscure contemplate your navel sort of film But on the other hand it is directed by Philip Kaufman He put together THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES though Clint Eastwood took over direction from him He did direct THE RIGHT STUFF He directed the remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and co wrote RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK These are NOT contemplate your navel films These are really entertaining pieces On the other hand more than one good director has gone bad trying to produce his or her personal vision of what is art Reluctantly I went to our local art theater and saw the best film I have seen yet this year THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING bears no small resemblance to DOCTOR ZHIVAGO Tomas is a young successful doctor who gets a wife and a mistress finds his life upset by political events and eventually finds a new equilibrium in spite of the political events Where it differs is that the political event is the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia instead of the Russian Revolution and that in some ways the women are equally attracted to each other so that the triangle really is a triangle rather than a V Attractive Czech surgeon Tomas played by Daniel Day Lewis seems to collect lovers like stamps His favorite phrase in both business and pleasure is take off your clothes and with remarkable regularity business turns into pleasure In a trip to a nearby spa town he tries to seduce a barmaid Tereza played by Juliette Binoche only to find that she follows him back to his apartment in Prague She enjoys sex with Tomas but is jealous of his other lovers including an artist Sabina attractive Lena Olin There are hints throughout the film that Tereza may be a repressed lesbian who finds herself attracted to Sabina On the other hand Lena is a bisexual who does not repress anything but the will to make some sort of commitment This triangle could have made for very high level soap opera but the Soviet invasion casts a new light on everything and forces each of the three to come to a better understanding of themselves and also tests their character The eroticism of the film if that is really what was intended is little more than amusing But you know that when you feel yourself actually missing a character whom you haven t seen on the screen for a while you are watching a well made film And once again Kaufman has made a long film 171 minutes that seems much shorter Rate this film a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0261,Beetlejuice,1988,BEETLEJUICE is a surprisingly enjoyable flick The story somewhat reminiscent of Thorne Smith s writing follows a recently deceased young married couple Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis who haven t been dead long enough to properly follow their Manual for the Recently Deceased They may not leave their house for fear of the netherworld they find outside complete with Arrakis like sandworms Ere long an obnoxious living couple well played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O Hara move in and immediately begin to wreak havoc with the afterlives of our protagonists They also have a teenage daughter Winona Ryder who is straight out of Charles Addams cartoons Due to her morbidity she may communicate with the ghosts who otherwise have trouble making themselves seen or heard Consulting their manual the couple seek help on their situation by going to a case worker at Spirit Central for advice All suicides become bureaucrats love it and they find little relief after waiting in line for two months However they have seen ads for a bio exorcist he exorcises the living named Betelgeuse Michael Keaton whom the case worker has warned them about He is a ne er do well and only adds to their problems Now they must rid themselves of him as well as resolve their situation with the living family and their spiritualist friends The film is fast paced and genuinely funny Much better than I d expected It does slow down near the end and it is also evident that some important plot telling moments were edited out of the finale in an attempt to pick it up I have also heard that there were other post production changes including the original premise that every time the couple leaves their house the Netherworld is different Apparently some found this too confusing and the producers dumbed it up I d have preferred it left alone The performances overall work but are not extraordinary Robert Goulet who has a minor part must have an aging portrait hidden away he looks younger here than he did in Atlantic City Michael Keaton carries himself adequately a la original Saturday Night Live in his only good role since MR MOM BEETLEJUICE was credibly directed by Tim Burton Pee Wee s Big Adventure The score is by Danny Elfman and is a cross between Danse Macabre and his work with Oingo Boingo I enjoy his work more and each each time I come across it Four classics by Harry Belafonte are featured including a funny sequence in which some dinner guests Dick Cavett among them become possessed and find themselves singing and dancing to Day O The art direction makes this film worth seeing on a large screen the sound is noteworthy as well and the upscale special effects are very good though there are minor flaws The film is rated PG which indicates that there is no on screen splatter or blood but I would not advise taking a young child There are a few scary moments and a lot of disembodied and mutilated characters Such as the case worker who puffs on a cigarette and the smoke comes out her throat While they are not gross a youngster would be likely to get genuinely frightened This should have gotten a PG 13 Nevertheless I definitely recommend this one
0262,Little Nikita,1988,One of the most frustrating experiences one is likely to have in a movie theater is to watch a good premise be ruined Of all the films that get made in Hollywood or anywhere else for that matter relatively few are based on an idea that s worth mentioning Most are rehashings of films past sometimes well done more often not So when someone comes up with an idea that isn t totally familiar you get your expectations up If they re disappointed you feel worse about the film than if it had been another rehash of the same old junk LITTLE NIKITA is a good case in point The theme of the film is rich in possibilities a typical American kid finds out that his parents are actually Soviet agents A good writer could take this premise in a lot of interesting directions We could see the film through the eyes of the kid concentrating on his world coming down around him It could be a mystery in which you aren t sure till the last minute whether or not the parents really are the agents You could present the film from the point of view of the authorities tracking the enemy agents You could even work from the point of view of the parents But the most critical point is that you have to have a point of view and that is precisely what LITTLE NIKITA lacks The film never decides whose story is being told here so it rapidly and repeatedly shifts gears The result is that it never settles into any rhythm and there is no consistent tone We never find out whose story this is If lack of focus were LITTLE NIKITA s only problem it might have been a flawed but interesting film Unfortunately its problems are legion Richard Benjamin who actually made a couple of good films early in his directing career is utterly incompetent here There is no suspense no tension no consistency even of style He utterly botches the film s climax which doesn t make much sense anyway Cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs shoots what Benjamin asked him to well but often the choice of what to shoot was badly mistaken Also beyond problems in viewpoint the script is a mess The dialog is either poor or pointless The plot makes little or no sense The characters are dully constructed of cardboard Several writers including Bo Goldman one of the most respected screenwriters in Hollywood worked on this script All I can guess is that they each threw some parts of the script out and the producers mistakenly got hold of all the rejected material and pasted it together into the final form As presented on the screen the script is unbelievably amateurish and flimsy The acting does little to help Sidney Poitier showed why he had been a major star in SHOOT TO KILL Here he shows why he retired Poitier flounders in the rotten part of an FBI agent trying to capture a renegade Soviet agent One moment he s the dedicated cop the next he s playful and lighthearted He can t seem to decide whether he s doing IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT or UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT Poitier plays each scene as if he had never seen any other scene in the script including those that were chronologically earlier Poitier is lucky that SHOOT TO KILL came out before LITTLE NIKITA as the earlier success will likely cause people to forget this fiasco River Phoenix has nothing worthwhile to contribute to the part of the boy Of course the script gives him little to work with and Phoenix has been very good in better parts so his flounderings can probably be blamed mostly on writing and direction Richard Bradford plays a Soviet agent as if he were giving examples of overused spy cliches Richard Lynch as the renegade adds yet another indistinguishable sadist part to his credits No real motivation is given for his character so he can probably be forgiven for repeated what he s done often before None of the other cast members does anything worthy of mention LITTLE NIKITA could have been so much more than it is The realities of Hollywood probably would have prevented it from being anything other than an action suspense movie but it could have been a good one Just imagine what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with it Instead LITTLE NIKITA is a waste of a couple of talented actors and an excellent idea It is utterly forgettable
0263,Beetlejuice,1988,Did you know that people who commit suicide become civil servants in the afterlife Do you know how to pronounce Betelgeuse You would if You had seen BEETLEJUICE the latest from Tim Burton If you saw PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE just try to picture a feature full of Large Marge characters and you ll be close But this is in many ways more like Burton s wonderful short Vincent than PEE WEE was In fact this is more like Tim Burton than his last feature PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE was Tim Burton at the service of Paul Reubens while BEETLEJUICE is Tim Burton at the service of Tim Burton For that reason I can recommend this movie to people who liked PEE WEE and also to those who hated it It s the same in the right ways and different in the right ways Confused I ll make it simple BEETLEJUICE is a much better film John Lasseter one of Burton s classmates at Cal Arts once said that being a film director could be a waste of Tim s talents as a designer I m happy to say that his inventive playful slightly dark sense of design is a major asset of the movie Another asset is the premise A newlydead couple haunting their New England home want to frighten off the neurotic New Yorkers who move in down stairs The trouble is they aren t very good at it How they get help is the crux of the movie and I won t spoil any of it for you BEETLEJUICE is funny well crafted and features a wonderful cast Even without Michael Keaton s manic oppressive performance you d have your money s worth so when he does appear it s a real bonus All but the most nightmare prone tots should get a kick out of the movie If they weren t scared by Large Marge they ll be fine A big part of the fun is that Burton delivers plenty of adult humor while still delivering enough good physical comedy to keep the kiddies in giggles Now we just need to get the Academy to create a special award for Best Use of a Harry Belafonte Album in a Motion Picture Soundtrack
0264,Dolls,1986,Capsule review Often charming little horror piece done to near perfection further establishes Empire Pictures reputation for being the creative horror film maker of today perhaps a latter day Hammer Films Rating high 1 Back in the mid 1950s while the science fiction film was first blossoming the horror film was foundering The Universal cycle that started in 1930 had gone into unconscious then self conscious self parody and died a decade before Horror films meant shoddy productions in which neurotic teenagers turned into vampires or werewolves or Frankenstein monsters Then in 1957 budget studio Hammer Films tried some radically new approaches to horror films and turned out well made products and the horror film was reborn Today the horror film is foundering in self parody in teen age films and in innumerable repeats of being chased by a bogeyman whom you cannot kill Knock him down and he just gets up HALLOWEEN 1 and 2 FRIDAY THE 13TH PART N THE TERMINATOR THE HITCHER etc etc even the final sequence of FATAL ATTRACTION The one time rip off producer who is exercising different nightmares and making some of the most creative horror films today is Charles Band s Empire Pictures That is the company who made the HOUSE films THE RE ANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND Among their most creative is TROLL which started as a film about a troll running around murdering people When the decision was made that the film had to be rated PG the gore was eliminated the horror toned down and both were replaced by a heavy dose of high fantasy TROLL is uneven but often charming and surprisingly entertaining More recently they have released DOLLS a sort of horror fairy tale in the tradition of A E Merritt that is also creative charming and entertaining but with a much better sense of mood and atmosphere than TROLL had During a storm six people are stranded in an old house with a mysterious old toymaker one time British swashbuckling star Guy Rolfe and his wife The house is full of toys and especially dolls The two visitors who are young in heart enough find all the dolls enchanting The other four find being surrounded by toys deadly dull Of course as the evening wears on they find it less and less dull and more and more deadly Like an episode of the old TWILIGHT ZONE episode it is not very surprising where the story is going but the telling of the story is nicely and originally done with enough special effects to capture the imagination but not so much as to distract from the people DOLLS is a gentle film with a gentle message and just a tad too much gore as if it is walking a line between EC Comics and TWILIGHT ZONE but in a market where filmmakers are retreading each other s ideas DOLLS recently released to cassette is something different The story is fairly not entirely new and done with high production values The same could have been said of Hammer Films first big success CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN Rate it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0266,Beetlejuice,1988,Excuse me if this review is not very well constructed I have to write it very very quickly I just saw BEETLEJUICE an extremely forgettable fantasy film So much so that even as I walked out of the theater large pieces of the film were being forgotten forever Why is BEETLEJUICE so forgettable I guess because the producers had so much budget and so little story It is not that it was a bad story It was co authored by Michael McDowell one of the leading modern horror writers but it was about four pages worth of story and the rest was just lathered on special effects Remembering the film entails remembering the list of special effects mostly totally gratuitous that were laid on at at various points in the minimal story The story of BEETLEJUICE involves oh rats What was it about oh yes a young couple who live in a rustic little town and love their old house They are in a car accident and are killed Now is this where they see the ghost with the shrunken head and the smoker who was charred to a cinder No I think that s later in the plot Oh well it doesn t really matter Anyway they go back to their house and can get in but can t get out again Yeah I m pretty sure this is where they had the alien landscape special effect and the giant sandworm That s what they face if they leave the house Wait that doesn t make sense they were just outside the house Well I guess making sense doesn t matter And then yes that s it some not very nice people buy the house and start to remodel it The ghosts don t like that so try to scare the new owners Now is this where they rip their faces off altogether or is this where they just stretch their faces into funny shapes Doesn t matter I guess So where does Beetlejuice fit into this Well first off there is nobody named Beetlejuice There is someone named Betelgeuse like the star and that s pronounced Beetle juice but then why isn t the film called BETELGEUSE Darned if I know Anyway Betelgeuse fits in later in the plot But don t worry about the plot The filmmakers didn t The star of the film is Geena Davis who is attractive enough to occasionally upstage the special effects She may be familiar from television work or from her role in the remake of THE FLY Alec Baldwin is forgettable as her husband Jeffrey Jones as the new owner is used to being upstaged by special effects as in HOWARD THE DUCK And Michael Keaton was on hand as uh give me a second oh yes in the title role No wait there was nobody in the title role Well anyway give this tournee of mediocre special effects a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0267,Seventh Sign The,1988,Following the success of first ROSEMARY S BABY and the THE EXORCIST there were a number of Bible prophecy horror films In them the word of the Bible took on new relevance as young people in them discover that all the prophecies and strange symbolism are true and perfectly relevant to our times Films like THE SENTINEL HOLOCAUST 2000 a k a THE CHOSEN and the three film OMEN series After a while they disappeared only to return about a decade later with THE SEVENTH SIGN As the run of this sort of film goes THE SEVENTH SIGN is probably above average Even without the big Hollywood treatment that Twentieth Century Fox gave THE OMEN this is a nice suspenseful story well told There are funny things happening in the world Off Haiti there are fish dying and washing up on shore In the Negev Desert an entire village is found frozen But then weird things happen every day We see them on the news over dinner and then they get forgotten Abby Quinn played by Demi Moore sees and forgets a lot of news Her interests are more worrying about the baby that she will very soon have She also worries about her husband s career as a criminal defense lawyer he is played by Michael Biehn and about the mysterious boarder played by Jurgen Prochnow who has come to live above her garage The audience knows this mysterious figure has been present at each of the strange events that has happened fulfilling some sort of mission It all has to do with a prophecy of seven signs that the end of the world is coming One of the signs has something to do with Abby but what sign and why Well since even the film is confused about what the signs are in fact it outright contradicts itself it is not surprising that Abby does not know the signs The story unravels to a nice piece of fantasy as will a good horror story It is nice to see Demi Moore in a film that calls for her to be a little more than just a yuppie On the other hand this may be Michael Biehn s most forgettable role as a lawyer with little personality Not that he had a lot of personality in TERMINATOR or ALIENS but there he was enough action so that you did not notice John Heard has a cameo as a likable Catholic priest somewhat recreating his role from HEAVEN HELP US THE SEVENTH SIGN is not a great horror film A year from now it will play one month on cable guaranteed It s a Tri Star film and then probably be forgotten But it is a reasonable little exercise in Bible horror Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0268,House on Carroll Street The,1988,For me thrillers are difficult to really dislike While I usually find a mediocre comedy objectionable enough to actively disklike a thriller with even a few redeeming qualities can have me leaving the theater feeling sated The trick is this is a thriller packed season I assume due to the success of FATAL ATTRACTION Unfortunately the ones provided are lackluster even by my relatively lax standards Of the thrillers I ve seen over the last few weeks only this one made the mark and then just barely Polanski uses his shots sparingly while there is little direct menace in this film there is a good deal of suspense both from the underlying plot an American surgeon s wife is kidnapped in Paris but no one believes him and from the careful camera work It also has an conclusion which doesn t seem to have been meddled with by some asinine public poll And compared to some other more obtuse thrillers the relatively down to earth plot was appreciated This has occasionally been compared to Hitchcock s films I think it s to be appreciated more if you say that the premise is something that Hitchcock would do And there s some merit in that as well On the other hand no one gives more than a 2 5 dimensional performance in the film which can get by in a thriller but it s not a complement Ford plays rather cold determined husband though he did make that important attraction between his character s wife and himself in the opening scene The young Parisian who helps him is memorable only for that incredibly distracting leather skirt And the plot barely holds together on the hairpin turns Satisfying but nothing to rave over 3 worth Lots of bad points in this the two romantic leads smolder about as much as a doused Girl Scout campfire the plot is barely comprehensible and not particularly suspense building and there wit which usually marks Peter Yates thrillers isn t here Yates has a background in doing good thrillers so this is a disappointment Two good points but not enough to save the film Mandy Patinkin plays one of the most repulsive villains to grace the scene in quite a while Instead of overt threats of violence he marks his character with an ability to rationalize anything to support his decisions It s been suggested that this is based on Roy Cohn but Patinkin gives it his own special reptilian touch he looks like a young Robert DeNiro Good scene The other point of interest is that this is one of the few period films where they really put effort into making it look In Period There are a lot of large crowd scenes street scenes and outdoor scenes and I couldn t spot anything that wouldn t be out of place in the 50s Right out of a Rex Stout mystery Not worth the interest really not even a decent video 1 00 but go to the library Wonderful concept a guy gets poisoned and has 48 hours to figure out who killed him You know he s going to die no way around it even though I ve seen the original B W version it s still a compelling basis for the story The twist of having the fellow who is D O A see how much life was really worth and how badly he wasted it is an even better twist And the film has the kind of manic original photography you d expect from the couple that did the original Max Headroom video But it bogs down on other points None of the characters really are appealing except for Quaid s character and he only hints at the thoughts he must be having with his limited time While the concept is sound the detail work stinks the red herrings are incompetently done and wholly unbelievable and the revelation of the murderer is a real Perry Mason job if you know what I mean The photography while interesting at the beginning really begins to wear down especially when it reverts to standard during the actions scenes in the middle It ends up reminding you of a neon game of Clue instead of a mystery thriller Perhaps more of a mystery than a thriller come to think of it it could be a lot of things by definition It ends up being a stinker with a really great story concept behind it If they d shortened it to 20 minutes put it in the new TWILIGHT ZONE TV program and had got rid of all the distraction cameos this would have made it But there are so many problems not the least being that Ellen Barkin whose ability to appear awkward worked so well in THE BIG EASY may have indicated that it comes from actually being awkward she overplays this thing like she was back on the set of BUCKAROO BANZAI The rest of it seems to foster the kind of useless babbling that is labeled fresh but is usually a bid for lengthening the film

Mattausch Gerd Rigauer Franz Rudnick Gunter Sporrle Rainer Steffen Credits Directed by Heinz Schirk Produced by Manfred Korytowski Executive Producer Siegfried B Gloker Screenplay by Paul Mommertz Director of Photography Horst Schier Historical Advisor Shlomo Aronson University of Jerusalem Editor Ursula Mollinger Sound Engineer Sigbert Stark Art Direction by Robert Hofer Ach Barbara Siebner Costumes Diemut Remy Production Manager Jochen Riedel Just about everyone knows how terrible the Holocaust was But it s not something that most people think about other than in casual terms The sheer numbers of those killed and the barbarity of Auschwitz numb the mind These horrors are so immense that they loom large and become monolithically unfathomable But it is important to remember that those who set this brutally efficient extermination of machine in motion were not robots or animals but humans It is simple and comforting to dismiss those Nazis who established and maintained the concentration camps as sub human beasts But they were not They were alive and they were human with flesh and blood that differs little from you or me That s a scary thought It s scary because we like to think that we are above such things that we could never jump into the same trap they did Even our broadest and most forgiving concept of humanity has to be stretched to the limit when it comes to fitting in the Nazis It s concerns like these that often inspire artists to give expression and meaning to the immense human despair and sacrifice they have witnessed The amount that has been written about the Holocaust over the last forty years is staggering and the number of films poems and memorials seem to keep growing Who has not seen at some point in their life photographs of the ovens and bone thin survivors and the plaques that boldly proclaim NEVER AGAIN Sadly these kinds of polemics are not enough All too often their moralizing and didactic tone distance the viewer or reader from the true importance of what is being said And that makes it all too easy for adults to dismiss these images as trite because it couldn t happen again The recent emergence of those who would revise history by denying that the Holocaust happened at all is at least partially attributable to our growing collective amnesia brought on by an ongoing disregard for increasingly perfunctory warnings The philosopher Hannah Arendt once wrote on the banality of evil and its manifestations There is at least one film that understands how to apply this concept to the Nazis It is THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE a film made for German television in 1984 It is only now being shown in the United States On January 20 1942 fifteen high ranking members of the Nazi government attended a meeting in the upper class Berlin suburb of Wannsee Until that meeting the extermination of the Jewish population was done primarily on an ad hoc basis The officials who gathered that day at 56 58 Am Grossen Wannsee adopted the final solution as a formal official policy Detailed minutes of the meeting including descriptions of the food and drink served and records of informal conversations were taken by a secretary who is still alive and living in Germany She refused to be interviewed by the filmmakers In 1961 Israeli born producer Manfred Korytowski best known in West Germany for producing PUMUCKL a television show for children that enjoys a Sesame Street level of popularity traveled to Israel to film a documentary about the war crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann a conference participant While there he came across references to the Wannsee conference and soon discovered the secretary s notes at Yad Vashem the Holocaust Archives in Jerusalem His interest aroused he quickly concluded that the conference demanded a definitive cinematic treatment After six years of intensive research he managed to accumulate letters about the conference from Heinrich Himmler and Herman Goering as well as documents from the Nuremburg trials and Eichmann s trial From these records writer Paul Mommertz fashioned a dense screenplay from which the film was made The film directly recreates the conference and runs 85 minutes exactly the length of the actual meeting itself The film s approach is opposite that taken by most films on the Nazis It simply presents the Nazis as accurately as the records allow without commentary or narration As the conference gets under way the men crack jokes flirt with the secretary and drink cognac that the waiters bring out And all during the meeting the discussion centers on how to best consolidate the mechanisms for mass extermination under one command Reinhard Heydrich the chief of the Nazi Security Police and Secret Service who convened the meeting becomes particularly pleased when the conference participants readily agree to support his plans for implementing the final solution Not only does it bolster his own political ambitions he was designated as Hitler s successor but it masks the responsibility for the decision behind a collective committee decision Director Heinz Schirk makes no attempt to soften or highlight any of this He lets the meeting and the participants speak for themselves The most telling comment of his own that he makes during the film is through his camera work After showing the exterior of the house and a few other establishing shots the camera enters the conference room and does not emerge from the house again until the end of the meeting and the film This is the primary element responsible for attuning the audience to the supersensitized sense of reality that pervades the film While inside the room the camera almost seems to adopt the emotional characteristic of a Greek chorus witnessing the events unflinchingly while being unable to influence the seemingly inevitable outcome Near the beginning of the film the camera executes a complete rotation about the long rectangular table at which the participants are seated The camera pans just slowly enough to catch the flavor of the conversations it encounters creating an eerie sense of observing the events through a solid glass wall At one point two men in the foreground laugh at a joke about defiling a Jewish woman s vagina while the secretary in the background winces and averts her eyes Most of the film is presented matter of factly through this sort of mise en scene and detailed shot composition And all of it is presented in real time The actors were chosen for their physical resemblance to their characters but their acting skills are uniformly excellent as well While all the actors work together to create a remarkable ensemble performance Dietrich Mattausch is particularly effective in portraying Reinhard Heydrich and his actions in accessible terms He is disarmingly and disturbingly human while reassuring the others who admit to having fainted or being uneasy about the final solution The unification of actor and character is so complete that one wonders how the actors kept themselves from being scarred emotionally while trying to divorce themselves from their roles after the shoot The filmmakers demand for complete precision even the pens and watches are accurate results in a copious use of Nazi jargon Nevertheless one need not know that Reichsfuhrer S S refers to Heinrich Himmler to understand the essence of what is being discussed The facial expressions voice cadences and bodily mannerisms all have a universal value that can easily be grasped Furthermore the English subtitles have been culled from the best of three separate translations one original transcript one by a poet and one rigorously accurate Ultimately however what is most striking about the film and the events it portrays is how casually it all happens One man came to the conference from a shopping trip Another man leaves the conference to see why his dog is barking outside while the others inside continue to sip cognac and brandy And when a railway official complains that seat repair costs have been rising it all seems no different from any corporate board meeting until you realize that the official is annoyed because the frozen bodies of Jews stuck to their train seats in the cold cannot be removed without damaging the seats It seems odd that a film as muted in style as this one could evoke strong reactions As I left the theater I wanted to scream in anger and disbelief How could these men these people these humans possibly talk about Jewish people as though they were tools to be used for maximizing efficiency ratings How could they sit through such a morbid discussion Didn t even one person have doubts or glimmer of conscience I just couldn t believe that the most controversial issue they discussed was whether to kill half Jews or merely to sterilize them But that exactly is the point This film disarmed me and prevented me from raising any defense mechanisms The starkly human Nazis just stared at me in the face and I was transfixed unable to look away This wasn t nine hours of victims talking or pointing to Nazi horrors or mountains of facts and figures like Claude Lanzmann s SHOAH This was 85 minutes of pure unadulterated scenes of the Nazis going about their business What could be more damning than watching the Nazis from the inside Even Louis Malle s recent heartfelt film AU REVOIR LES ENFANTES showed the Gestapo from the outside as monolithic entities I was stunned as I left the theater All of the thoughts I wrote about above came crashing down on me to the point that I couldn t think about anything else for the rest of the day I was not able to get the final freeze frame of a Nazi playing with his dog out of my mind A German shepherd lunges for a stick in the man s raised hand while a sharply pungent piano chord in the only use of music in the film accompanies the image Six months after having seen the film at the Boston Film Festival I still can t forget I know I never will

0271,Unbearable Lightness of Being The,1988,Quick three film reviews so I can start up on the Seattle Film Festival yes here we go again a pre festival report will be out before the Thursday night starting gun Not much to say other than very entertaining film and a few comments Noticed the poster as I went out this film is the first film in years that had everyone who had the entire solarsphere of critics behind it Siskel Ebert Reed NEW YORK TIMES the L A paper TIME NEWSWEEK VILLAGE VOICE and I believe a favorable quote from Kael When did this last happen GONE WITH THE WIND Waters would love that on his ad The first film to gather universal praise since GONE WITH THE WIND And David O Selznick never had to overcome having shot someone eating dog doo Basically this is the same as one of those Kurt Russell Disney films where the school outcasts have good things happen to them with a minimum of struggle in a Happy Environment Except that these people are outcast which ol Walt would never have approved of let s face it Kurt Russell an outcast ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK maybe but he had Adrienne Barbeau And more importantly Water s never loses his spoofing satirical bite in fact it runs concurrently with the starry eyed plot neither stealing cycles from the other A solid 4 50 film Take the kids they ll love it the 10 year olds in the audience were really enjoying it and I d deem everything in this film wholesome for 10 year olds or even 6 year olds So this is what all the hoopla is about Well it s a good film my main observation would be that the best part of the thing was John Lone s performance as the Emperor and that s the one thing the film didn t get nominated for which keeps my opinion of the awards at it s previously low level Nice ending but rather bloodless for an epic You can either do an epic without involving interesting characters intelligently or ridiculously but it needs to be pervaded with an overpowering sense of the Larger than Life A little schmaltz doesn t hurt either yeah I liked DR ZHIVAGO Again a nice ending 2 50 film see it on Economy Hour This is one of those films that becomes manically annoying during its length but leaves you with a favorable impression because the ending is good enough to wipe out what came before It s one of those love stories which follows the lives of several characters over a period of years It works but it has drawbacks Daniel Day Lewis what has this man played in before His face looks very familiar oh wait I know MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE and the actress who plays his lover tend to be rather hollow through much of the film The actress who plays his wife though comes off very well and damn near saves the film during the last half hour Good parts their early encounters the invasion of Czechoslovakia their return the move to the farm I have great affection for merry older rural people And pigs Bad points Day and his character s lover s affairs the photo session scene Two Points Why is this film considered more sexually honest than others I keep hearing that from all sorts of newspaper reviews What every guy is out boinking a lover while his wife sits home and suffers They squeal more realistically during intercourse in this film I guess film journalists live fairly Bohemian lives And do you think that the Czech couple really die in the end Or is it that Day s character in his typically egocentric manner is day dreaming about his lover s reaction to news of their death I go for the former but either way it s a damn inventive way to end the film and very satisfying
0272,Nitti,1988,Last summer when Brian DePalma s THE UNTOUCHABLES was released I made the comment that nobody seemed to get the facts right about Frank Nitti a gangster who was misrepresented by the papers in his own time and who became the regular arch rival of Elliot Ness in television s UNTOUCHABLES after the series had their Capone go to prison DePalma had Nitti dying before Capone ever got to prison Each had a polished pre shaped image for Nitti to fit into the story they wanted to tell Now ABC has made a film to tell just the story of Nitti himself I watched it with curiosity to find out if someone was finally going to get down to the real gritty Nitti Well something everybody gets wrong about Nitti was the idea that he ran the Capone gang after Big Al got sent up DePalma got it wrong differently but even less accurately The contemporary newspapers wanted to write about a single person running the gang and with Al gone they wrote the story as if Nitti ran the gang In truth the organization of the gang became pretty complicated with different people having power in different areas Nitti may have even thought that he was running the show but in truth he did not command much obedience Well FRANK NITTI THE ENFORCER makes pretty much the same mistake at least if Nitti has competition running the mob the film understates it for many of the years it was going on Beyond that as far as I have been able to verify the facts in Carl Sifakis s authoritative ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN CRIME and MAFIA ENCYCLOPEDIA the film has a sort of 50 50 hold on the truth They get off to a bad start by saying that Nitti was born in 1888 making him four years younger than he actually was Then the film has him seeking out Capone out of respect Not so Nitti had parlayed his job as a barber for small time hoods into a fencing job before he had ever met Capone The Capone gang sought Nitti out to sell him stolen booze His skill at organization not so much at killing was the reason he rose in the organization It did leave him in a good position when Capone went to prison but not the undisputed head the papers made him out to be Speaking of the papers the film did get right that Elliot Ness was a headline hound who had little serious effect on the mob but who was a hero in the papers That seems to be the truth By padding the film with a love story and showing scenes of incidents like the St Valentine s Day Massacre without telling what led up to them the filmmakers have produced a story much of which is neither really accurate nor inaccurate There is also some speculation stated as fact The killing of Chicago Mayor Cermack is usually assumed to be an accident when he got in the way of an assassin s bullet intended for FDR The film s claim that the assassin Zangara was actually trying to kill Cermack under orders from the Capone mob is only a minority opinion Beyond that much of the plot and particularly the muscling into the entertainment business and how it led to Nitti s death was all square with the encyclopedia facts FRANK NITTI THE ENFORCER is nicely photographed in subdued colors that both satisfy the network s requirement for color and evoke some of the black and white feel of the classic gangster films or the sepia tone of the photography of the period Anthony LaPaglia playing Nitti leads a cast of unfamiliar faces one exception is Michael Moriarty playing a lawman LaPaglia s troubled introspective crime lord who kills for strategic ends but never for personal anger looks amazingly like a cross between Robert DeNiro and Sam Waterston Overall FRANK NITTI THE ENFORCER is nearly as subdued as its colors but as gangster films go it is not all that far from being accurate As a fan of this sort of film I would say that FRANK NITTI THE ENFORCER with a 50 50 record for accuracy is far closer to being true than 99 of gangster films And Frank Nitti whom I have always claimed was misrepresented to the public gets about the fairest shake from this film as any gangster ever gets from the movies Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Not bad for a made for TV movie
0273,Cop,1987,For my money the actor who delivers more emotional punch to his films no matter what problems the script has is James Woods True he often plays roles where his character is on the edge of lunacy of society of moral and ethical behavior but he scintillates in such parts His eyes get bright he gets that sideways grin leer and he uses his voice like an electric carving knife cutting into whoever he s talking to He does it again in COP which almost but not quite makes it as an excellent film Woods plays a hot shot L A police detective a real cowboy who literally loves his work He s smart and intuitive and slick and very brash and socially a fair to middlin creep he s also so caught up in his work that his home life has gone to hell Underneath it all is an obsession with innocence that is coming out as things begin to fall apart domestically some concept that he sees in the faces of the female victims he comes across in his day to day work The film opens with Woods character investigating a tip from a burglar about an apartment homicide he finds the body of a young woman who has been gruesomely murdered hanging from the ceiling As the film progresses Woods becomes convinced that she is a victim of a serial murderer however he has no real evidence of this much of his conviction comes from the look of innocence in the photos of the victims and the department doesn t like the possibility serial killers indicate that they got away with it for months or years before the police noticed it So we are left for much of the film trying to figure out whether Woods is an obsessive rather repugnant investigative genius or whether he is off his nut and interpreting a single murder to be the latest in a long line of executions It s a fascinating dilemma for the viewer and Woods just equivocates back and forth between the two positions An excellent performance a balancing act that works like a charm and it continues to keep Woods in my book of the five best character actors working in American film today The other actors are good too and the script deserves credit for not making anyone a stereotype either good or bad Well almost everyone Charles Haid comes off very poorly as a Beverly Hills cycle cop perhaps because I have a hard time not seeing him as Renko on Hill Street Blues And the script has a good sense of the humorous though it s often rather morbid The burglar s monologue as the opening credits roll by and Woods evening story to his 6 year old daughter seeded with police terms like an official report are quite funny and liven the film up at points But now for the drawback of the film the ending The last fifteen minutes show that the screenwriter who had some very good moments through the early part of the film really lost it in the end It would be a pedestrian ending except for its abruptness though it does leave Woods with a hell of a good line No follow up on the characters it just left me hanging for more Its finale is too flawed for me to give the film a full thumbs up but the it s worth 2 50 3 00 for the first 1 5 hours An economy hour choice
0274,Return of the Killer Tomatoes!,1988,Well on the fast moving satirical scale of film this isn t up to AIRPLANE but is about halfway between it and TOP SECRET which I liked fairly well so this is a definite thumbs up Lots of fast moving jokes but perhaps the best point is that the film gets funnier instead of running out of steam as it progresses It keeps the pace and that is a rarity in so many of these films I was grinning through all of it and laughing through many of the gags about the only film that I have ever laughed continuously through is MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL Tons of Meta humor including one running joke about financial problems which gets funnier and funnier as it goes No Killing Joke i e gag that you carry out of the theater remembering for years to come With a Killing Joke you don t see the joke think about it and laugh all in a nano second unless you re Jesse Helms you see it and then black out from laughing Totally unexpected there s no middleman twixt the screen and the brain The rear collision Pinto gag in TOP SECRET is a classic of that genre though not up by any means to the Python films the absolute pinnacle of Killing Joke humor is the bit in HOLY GRAIL where Arthur sends a knight down to dispatch the stuffed rabbit and then it leaps for the knight s throat and rips his head off Everything went black for me when I first saw the film But very constant humor John Astin is probably the only actor who can be endearing while cackling inanely for two hours The film s low budget works for it not against it and you feel almost parental towards it Some of the actors from the previous film ham it up just a too much the parachute gag got old long before this but I can live with it Besides it sports Karen Mistal the most finest looking woman ever to grace The Fox Television Network in a prominent role and her eyes glow red Keen Imagine the girl you had puppy love for in high school crossed with a Norwegian sex goddess and you get the idea Oh callow youth A definite success solid 4 50 film
0275,Tokyo Pop,1988,SYNOPSIS We have the tale of a young woman from L A attempting to break into rock singing who decides to visit a friend in Japan when she hears that they love American rock n roll there Upon arriving she finds that her friend has left and that she must break into show biz on her own On the way she meets a barely English speaking lead singer for a band trying to get a hit They re looking for a gaijin singer as a gimmick to take them to stardom but then she and he start to get interested in one another do I have to spell it out gang This is a USDA approved romantic comedy TOKYO POP is one of those two handed films On the one hand Carrie Hamilton has got a lot of screen appeal and it works through most of the film Yutaka Tadokoro plays the lead singer in a very likable manner he is able to switch between a rather shy manner around Hamilton and a typical rocker with the rest of his band The film makes some interesting points about the fleeting nature of media fame both in Japan and the United States And you feel fairly good when you leave the theater On the other hand It all gets just too precious at points If you can t figure out what the wrap up is a half hour before the end of the show go hit the Video Palace and check out every other Lover Rocker films There s not much subtlety here though the camerawork s good and it needs it There is also a lot of mugging in this film by Hamilton it appears that both Carol Burnett and Martin Sheen have somehow begot physical clones of themselves by Tadokoro his puppy dog act at points is just too likeable he gets downright plush like a Gund doll and by the film where the camera stays a bit too long on Americanized Japanese as if it was playing to the American audiences specifically Perhaps this isn t strictly a foreign film it was co produced in America it uses sub titles when needed but I like to think that a director is making comments about his country and his culture from his own perceptions and not pandering to the tastes of a market outside his country Though I suppose it could be argued that directors here pander to markets in our own country So much for that argument Anyway a good 3 50 movie but I wonder about authenticity PS to rec arts comics readers Chris Claremont would love this movie His tongue would fall out he d roll over on his back and drool uncontrollably over his beard Then he d make both characters mutants and put them in next month s X MEN

Ronald Jacobs Co Producer Paul Lewis Costume Supervisor Nick Scarano Technical Advisors Dennis Fanning LAPD Gerald Ivory LA County Probation Dept and Roy Nunez LA County Sheriff s Dept The name Dennis Hopper instantly evokes images of the darker side of human existence both in his films and his personal history His 1969 film EASY RIDER captured the country s imagination through its seminal exploration of alienated youth His star waned in 1971 after the flop of his avant garde and anti Hollywood THE LAST MOVIE and he subsequently became heavily addicted to drugs He burned himself out and ended up walking around nude in the Mexican desert Hopper finally decided to clean up his act in 1983 but he has remained faithful to his tumultuous roots since his remarkable comeback His acting roles in films like APOCALYPSE NOW HOOSIERS and BLUE VELVET have explored the cult of death drunkenness and violent sex Last summer s RIVER S EDGE again returned him to the biker generation of EASY RIDER Now eight years after he last directed a film Hopper has made COLORS and it has his name written all over it It is about the status of gang warfare in Los Angeles where as the opening titles point out 250 police officers have to deal with the violence of 600 gangs with over 70 000 members The film gets its name from the colored jackets or headbands members of one gang wear to distinguish themselves from other gangs as they roam their designated turfs with Uzi submachine guns and Soviet made AK 47 assault rifles Sean Penn and Robert Duvall star as two LA Police Department officers assigned to each others as partners who try to stem the flow of violence and drugs on their beat Duvall plays Bob Hodges an older and wiser cop on the verge of retirement who trys to foster enough good will with gang members to allay their we vs them attitude Penn s character is Danny Pacman McGavin a young rough and tumble cop who wants to hit the gangs hard where it hurts most The film explores the dynamic between these two cops as they try to trace a leader of the Crips gang whose members wear blue named Rocket Don Sheadle who at the beginning of the film guns down a man wearing the red colors of the opposing Bloods gang During their search for Rocket Hodges recognizes his own early hotheadedness in the brash McGavin and trys to channel McGavin s energy in more constructive directions Although Duvall is a far more accomplished actor than Penn whose acting similarly paled next to Timothy Hutton in THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN Duvall and Penn manage to somehow create a defiant chemistry The dynamic between them comes full circle at the end of the film as McGavin becomes the one with a new and overzealous partner who needs some experienced advice Unfortunately this is as deep as the characterization gets which is all too typical of films as wrapped in car chases shootings and gory deaths as this one The supporting characters include Maria Conchita Alonso last seen in THE RUNNING MAN in the throw away role of having to choose between loving McGavin or being loyal to her fellow Chicanos and gang friends Her character is little more than a token love interest for Penn intended perhaps to balance Duvall s wife and kids Hopper and scriptwriter Michael Schiffer have no idea how to integrate women into the machismo of the world they are recreating on screen and they would have done themselves and the audience a service had they excluded Alonso entirely rather than mishandling her character so poorly Haskell Wexler s cinematography he shot John Sayle s MATEWAN last year is excellent as ever For COLORS he used a new high speed film stock so as to move from set up to set up without losing momentum He also used a camera known as a hot head which is a radio controlled camera mounted on the arm of a crane that can be manipulated from a distance by the camera operator This allows remarkable freedom in cramped quarters and one scene in the film demonstrates its capabilities beautifully In a crowded jail scene as two gang members talk about plans to kill McGavin the camera slowly pans backwards over a crowded table around which four other inmates are playing cards One of the cardplayers is eavesdropping on the conversation just as Wexler s camera is eavesdropping on him This unification of form and content carries the viewer inside the scene and as Wexler points out With any traditional camera system we d have needed space for both the crane and the operator This way the camera wasn t simply an observer but a participant Herbie Hancock s music is quite different from the slow and somber music he wrote for ROUND MIDNIGHT Here his music is strong and forceful as it needs to be during the chase scenes Hancock also tries to link the scenes with Alonso and Penn together with a recurring love theme but he cannot save the scenes from their inherent triteness The film also uses rock songs and especially rap music in conjunction with the costumes and graffiti covered rooms to convey an overriding impression of the squalor afflicting the ghettos Except for some overly bright lighting that detracts from this ominous mood the other production values are equally topnotch Given Hopper s attraction to the thrill of danger he decided to shoot the film in Watts and other sections of Los Angeles where even police officers hesitate to enter unless they have to investigate serious crimes like murder or rape The gang members Hopper met trusted Hopper implicitly and developed a remarkably strong rapport with him so much so that Hopper actually cast a few of them in the film as extras Much controversy has arisen over this fact as well as the film s depiction of violence and the gang lifestyle It is true that Hopper s film teeters just to the edge of exploiting the violence but it does step back from the brink of gratuity enough to maintain a hold on reality Because Hopper gained the trust of the gangs and worked with them effectively he was in a unique position to portray gang life from the inside If his primary goal were to call attention to the urban warfare being waged in Los Angeles Hopper could have made a documentary or a television special He would have reached a more limited audience that way but at least he could have made a serious contribution to the issue But Dennis Hopper is not Bill Moyers It is characteristic of Hopper to explore volatile matters in his films and it would be foolish to expect a single document or film about gang warfare to show the remedies to all aspects of gang warfare But what is cause for concern is that Hopper rejects conventional explanations for the underlying causes of gang warfare In one scene a community social worker tries to organize residents of the ghetto to help the police control the gangs But as Hopper directs the scene when the social worker tries to give some reasons for the existence of gangs like poverty and lack of role models for younger kids one man in the audience jumps up and shouts We know all that What are you gonna do about it The get together quickly degenerates into a shouting match and no progress is made Hopper cuts to a shot of Hodges sitting in the back of the room with a bemused expression indicating that he doesn t really expect much from meetings like this one The burden of gang violence remains on the police and understaffed social workers That leads to the film s attitude toward gangs one of utter resignation to their violence The futility of doing more than isolating and limiting gang violence is the whole point of Hodges philosophy and it s the same viewpoint McGavin adopts by the end of the film As for social workers Hopper shows them not making much headway either In another scene the same social worker who spoke to the residents tries to encourage some gang members to straighten out their lives Predictably he fails and Hopper uses the moment to demonstrate the appeal of gangs to youths such as fulfilling the need for a sense of identity and belonging The only bit of hope that appears in the film is buried in the character Frog Trinidad Silva who calls everyone homes for homeboys and has developed a cautious but firm understanding with Hodges over the years He is the only one who even trys to protect younger kids like his brother from the ravages of the ghetto and therein lies his real relevance to the film It seems obvious that gangs would eventually cease to exist in such large numbers if teenagers were given more positive alternatives to joining a gang The filmmakers recognize this since they do include scenes describing how Frog s younger brother joins Frog s gang McGavin confronts Frog s young brother while he is defacing a mural Despite McGavin s heavy handed effort he sprays paint in the boy s face to deter him Frog s brother later in the film endures beatings and humiliation as part of his initiation rites into Frog s gang However this ray of hope is buried by the film s view that the perpetuation of gangs is inevitable And that is what Hopper can be most justly criticized for Not for excluding a Reagan feel good optimism or for examining a difficult issue with unflinching eyes but for infusing the description of the problem with such an overriding pessimism that it dashes any hope for a solution The film urgently wants to point out how communities are being raped by gang violence but then comes dangerously close to telling those in such communities to either move out or bear it because there s no solution That is the real point those who condemn the film ought to focus on rather than picketing or calling for boycotts Because this film says that the most police and others can do is limit and restrain gangs it only contributes to the myopia of upper and middle class society which so far has been largely left untouched by the violence Tackling an issue as complex as the gang sub culture would require a massive commitment of funds and human resources from society and government and such a commitment so far has not been forthcoming That the film subtly and perhaps unintentionally supports this state of affairs is far more damaging and alarming than the effect of any exploitation or glorification in the film s depiction of gangs and their violence In the final analysis Hopper s unique persona had led him to a film that is too close to the reality of violence to be entertaining and too muddled intellectually to be illuminating Perhaps Hopper felt that he had to solidly demonstrate his directing talents again before tackling bolder and newer cinematic vistas Making COLORS has clearly confirmed the rejuvenation of Hopper s creative juices but it is quite disappointing that the film s most notable success is limited to this accomplishment Directorial Filmography of Dennis Hopper
0280,Colors,1988,After all the hoopla going on in the press and elsewhere I came out without much of an impression of the film as narrative entertainment As a story of a particular group of people living in a particular area based in reality I certainly can t comment on it s validity having never ventured into L A much less East L A other than it didn t seem to eject logic at any point I didn t form any idealized portraits of the gangs or the police the movie s main intention apparently was to outline the gang life there and the tragedy that it produces It doesn t blame any central reasons for the gang problem nor does it provide panaceas or easy answers for the problem It basically tries to snatch up a microcosm of this area and admittedly ignorant of the area it seemed successful in that So much energy is being used to keep things focussed that other elements like characters and story are kept in the background Not out of negligence I think I think it s Hopper s method to view the forest instead of the trees though he does some pretty impressive landscaping None of the actors stand out but all of them seem to fit their roles like a glove Duvall adds the usual personal quirks to his character that he s famous for but that just seems to add more reality to him Penn plays the young brash officer who sees the gangs as opponents decently Of the other actors most fill the characters to the brim without glomming the spotlight only Trinidad Silva Henry Silva s son seems to draw attention whenever he s on camera something he used to do on Hill Street Blues when playing Jesus Martinez the gang leader of the Diablos The man is hopelessly type cast but like Edward G Robinson he brings a fascination to the archetype again and again I felt it was worth the 2 50 I paid for admission in fact 3 50 would have been fine but it s aftermath is reflection not emotional stimulation Take that into account
0281,Mistero di Oberwald Il,1980,The following review is of a film appearing at the recent AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles I have no way of knowing whether the film reviewed will appear at any normal theaters any time in the near future or even at all In scientific research the researcher s ideal is the experiment in which all but one variable is controlled In such an experiment varying the single parameter can tell the researcher the precise results of changes small or large Artists on the other hand tend to experiment with abandon introducing a multitude of factors The effects of any given part of an artistic experiment become clear only after many experiments include it so that experience about the results can be validated Michelangelo Antonioni one of the bolder cinematic experimenters of the 1960 s however has chosen a more scientific method in THE OBERWALD MYSTERY He presents a film that is utterly conventional in all ways except one THE OBERWALD MYSTERY is based on a play by Jean Cocteau The story concerns a queen of an unspecified Middle European country who retired into solitude following the assassination of her husband An encounter with another assassin forces the queen to re examine her choice and accept responsibility for her country s fate The story faithfully followed by Antonioni and his co screenwriter Tonino Guerra is a sub standard piece of early twentieth century intellectual claptrap Antonioni and Guerra even preserve such stagebound devices as the opening scene between two minor characters who explain the background of the plot shabbily concealed behind a relationship that proves of no importance whatsoever to the story The play called THE EAGLE HAS TWO HEADS was obviously not Cocteau s finest hour Similarly acting editing and score have no surprises Monica Vitti gives a dull respectable performance as the queen and the supporting cast goes through the motions in a manner familiar to anyone who has seen many old Hollywood melodramas The editing is professional but unexciting The music is culled from classics by Strauss Schoenberg and Brahms and is used in the most conventional ways Were this the entire story THE OBERWALD MYSTERY would be a bafflingly stodgy addition to Antonioni s credits doubly baffling as Antonioni has never done anything so obvious and old fashioned before But there is one unique element the cinematography or perhaps more accurately the videophotography Even here much is standard and reminiscent of the work of the untalented The camera is permitted no interesting angles or movements Well almost none A director with as instinctive an eye as Antonioni s is hard put to eliminate every shred of interest from his camerawork The only innovation is in the use of color and video special effects Antonioni and cinematographer Luciano Tovoli shot THE OBERWALD MYSTERY on videotape They then performed odd permutations on the video image for three years and transferred the results to film Actors are bathed in colored lights suggestive of moods and motives Ghostly figures appear and disappear obedient to the characters memories Backgrounds fade and are replaced with images suitable to the feeling of the scene It s all quite peculiar And alas ineffective Some experiments unfortunately are failures THE OBERWALD MYSTERY must count as one such The coloring of the characters is more silly than artistically satisfying especially the blue filtering perpetually placed over the villainous head of the government s secret police The ghostly images are puzzling The switch of backgrounds is sometimes too subtle to be effective otherwise too obvious in its intentions Moreover the visual quality of videotape is too poor to stand up to a 35mm blowup The color when not washed out with Antonioni s little experiments is garish at its best it suggests a rather faded print of a Roger Corman Poe movie Sudden movements cause easily visible breakup of the image into scan lines And as usual video lends a flat boring texture to almost any scene Antonioni might simply be ahead of his time in the use of videotape For some years Hollywood filmmakers have been talking about high definition videotape and extolling its virtues Most of which have to do with the ease of editing The results have not been too impressive so far The special effects Antonioni incorporates through the use of special video processing machines are no great shakes Selective tinting of scenes has been around since the silents It wasn t a very effective technique then being the poor man s color film and it shows little potential for ever being any more effective Superposition of images is a well developed technology for film and the video version shown off in THE OBERWALD MYSTERY is not nearly as good as mediocre film work in this area And that s about it for Antonioni s bag of video tricks As an experiment THE OBERWALD MYSTERY has some interest for those few who care about the technology of filmmaking and the future of video The mere fact that such a prominent European filmmaker would spend so much time and effort on video has to be of some interest in and of itself However beyond this small band and the equally small band of Antonioni completists THE OBERWALD MYSTERY has little to offer Its tired story and run of the mill production provide little entertainment value Its intellectual underpinnings are musty Antonioni has put all his efforts into playing with one variable leaving the rest untouched It s a pity that he didn t set those other variables to more interesting values
0282,Seppan,1986,Sometimes it seems like every Scandinavian film made since Ingmar Bergman retired is about children In the Eighties I ve probably seen a couple of dozen new films from Sweden Norway Denmark and Finland and almost half of those have been primarily about children In that time I ve seen four Danish films four Swedish films a Norwegian film and a Finnish film that took children as their main subject Plus an Icelandic one which I guess should count as well What could cause this seeming obsession Do the Scandinavians really just make films about kids Or are their films about children the only ones good enough to bother showing abroad Or do US distributors feel their market will be more amenable to Nordic tots than sub Arctic angst Well most of them are quite good so I guess I shouldn t complain but the phenomenon is still odd What brought this imbalance in subject matter to my attention was the first film I saw at the current AFI Film Festival SEPPAN is yet another Swedish film about kids Because it s set in the 1950s and because the AFI Festival is not above just about any misrepresentation that will get people to come see their films the program billed it as similar to MY LIFE AS A DOG In actuality other than the period and a coincidental bit about Soviet satellites there s no resemblance either in subject matter or quality SEPPAN is about a group of children whose parents were World War II refugees who fled to Sweden Temporarily settled in Seppan a suburb of Stockholm children from Finland Russia and Austria intermingle in the process of becoming Swedish The film traces about one year in the life of some of these children focusing primarily on two girls on the verge of adolescence Perhaps focusing is a poor choice of words though because the film s major problem is focus SEPPAN doesn t seem to have much of a point Director writer Agneta Fagerstrom Olsson does not choose any central linchpin for her story There are a few tragedies some growing up an unenthusiastic examination of the relationships of parents and children a dalliance with a look at childhood friendship and finally some episodes dealing with the cruelty of children The whole seems more like a reminiscence without a point than a story SEPPAN is moderately interesting in its parts but never comes together into a whole Fagerstrom Olsson deserves praise for some aspects of the film however The acting of the children is marvelously natural The script has the feel of truth though alas also the feel of irrelevancy The photography by John O Olsson is interesting and pretty in a gloomy overcast way Fagerstrom Olsson definitely has the courage of her convictions in her willingness to show children as they really are rather than as we d like them to be But in her attempts to avoid crowd pleasing sellouts she has failed to substitute anything to interest the audience at all SEPPAN is not too likely to get much play outside of Scandinavia except perhaps at film festivals If it does it certainly won t match the success of MY LIFE AS A DOG The experience of watching SEPPAN is like hearing someone talk extemporaneously about their childhood Unless one shares the experiences or unless the experiences are extraordinary or unless the teller is a master childhood reminiscences are usually less than fascinating SEPPAN fails on the latter two counts so its potential interest for a viewer must be based on their childhood s relationship to Swedish post WWII refugee camps
0283,Beetlejuice,1988,Well I d give BEETLEJUICE a rather high rating but I have to point out something first I ve seen the director Tim Burton s other work namely the Disney shorts Vincent and Frankenweenie I exclude PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE only because I think that film conformed to Paul Reuben s concept more than Burton s and I have loved his sense of style and humor It s silliness but silliness that draws upon an almost cartoon like attitude and a bright lampooning of certain cinematic fashions Vincent had send ups of the Corman Price Edgar Allen Poe works and Frankenweenie contained howlers from the James Whales FRANKENSTEIN films an impressive achievement considering how well Mel Brooks mined this subject in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN BEETLEJUICE is no exception it s got more imagination and cleverness in both visually and in the script than anything else I ve seen this year I wouldn t highlight anything for you here because it s too much fun to discover what Burton has done with ghost story conventions For the most part he tends to provide a pretty logical hierarchy for the land of the undead though he leaves a few things like the Sandworms and the fates of several characters up in the air ha ha Most of all though the film is a whirling dervish of visual gags while the special effects are primitive at points the imagination with which they are used makes up for any lack of technical shine If you like Warner Bros cartoons I really think you ll like this it contains a lot of features which are personally appealing but not universally appealing Let us just say that if you liked his earlier short films you ll like this one The last scene Belafonte was never so good will last me for a long long time what a bizarre beautifully goofy fantasy A big thumbs up for me worth 6 or twice at 3 50 Footnote Saw BEETLEJUICE for the second time last night and whatever reservations I had about the film in my previous film scratch them The sound was much better during this showing and being able to comprehend more of the lines especially Keaton s I think the show was firing on all eight cylinders A 5 00 film easily and my favorite movie so far this year
0284,Dead The,1987,Having just seen John Huston s last film THE DEAD I can only report it as a strange thing A group of people gather at the Dublin home of two elderly sisters to celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany January 6 in 1904 There is no real plot the film merely follows the people through the course of the evening We find out a little about each what their relationships are and how they feel about one another Summed up this way you d think that there is little to recommend it But you d be wrong THE DEAD is a marvelous picture of a time and a people who are long gone From the first shot each character and scene are framed with loving care and I found myself engrossed by every line of dialogue The film is suffused with a wonderful humanity and warmth which draws you into the lives of these people By the end I was spell bound by the magic web Huston and the actors had woven In the theater where I saw it several people were still sitting silently in their seats when the credits had finished and the lights came up The film was that good THE DEAD is based on a short story by James Joyce in his collection DUBLINERS It was adapted for the screen by Tony Huston John Huston s son and stars Angelica Huston his daughter among others I m afraid I didn t recognize many of the other actors but other reviewers will undoubtedly know and list them The film is not for everyone but if you feel like hearing a final bit of poetry from a great voice of the American cinema I urge you to see THE DEAD
0285,Bellman and True,1987,One tends to think of the United States for crime films I distinguish between crime films and detective films a crime film is seen mostly from the criminal s point of view Having had a large piece of English speaking crime we have also been readier to make crime films than has England yet there have always been a number of modest little crime films made in England Films like LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN THE LONG ARM THE LAVENDER HILL MOB and THE LADYKILLERS have been likable but have not gotten much attention More recently some better films have been made including THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY and MONA LISA BELLMAN AND TRUE is a throwback to the earlier more modest British heist films Bernard Hill plays Hiller an electronics systems analyst who has accepted a 1000 pound advance to pas bank data to some criminals Unable to deliver the data in any form but on magnetic tape he runs away only to be kidnapped along with his stepson by the people he was fleeing They want more than their money back they want an electronics expert to help them rob a bank The film is about evenly divided between the story of the heist and Hiller s relationship with his son as they are caught up in the robbery scheme Frankly being an engineer myself I have a fondness for films in which engineering plays an important part and even tips the scales THE DAM BUSTERS one of my favorite war films is as much a film about solving wartime engineering problems as it is about soldiering In a sense engineering is the core of F X Engineering plays as big a role in this heist film as it does in the very enjoyable Australian heist film MALCOLM One sequence in the film in fact appears to be a direct theft from MALCOLM In a few places the engineering in BELLMAN AND TRUE seems to have gotten the facts wrong or underestimated the time to put together a sophisticated piece of toy robotics but that can be forgiven The serious engineering problems and the reason I really have to qualify my recommendation is in the production not the story The simple fact is that the film needed subtitles I had little trouble cutting through the thick Cockney accents of THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY or MONA LISA But I missed just too darn much of BELLMAN AND TRUE because the soundtrack seemed muddled there are some clever and witty lines in the film but some can be made out only by comparing notes with others So as much of the film as I could understand I rate a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0286,Bright Lights Big City,1988,Having heard that BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY had major flaws encouraged me to let it slide I do that with too many films being loathe to support fluff masquerading as substance However my daughter wanted to see it so I went with her and my wife to one of the 2 houses over the weekend It is a paean to the present anti cocaine hysteria The main character Jamie Conway portrayed by Michael J Fox is a young fact checker and would be fiction writer at a staid magazine However he spends most of his waking hours snorting coke and debauching himself He is abetted in these pursuits by Keifer Sutherland who plays Tad Allagash his coke sniffing side kick They live and work in Manhattan but mostly they just snort coke It turns out that the movie gets into Fox s relationships with women and this starts to lift it out of its coke kills message His wife has left him and gone on a modeling assignment to Paris She tells him she will not be back soon He is not sure what that means His cocaine activities get him peripherally involved with female moral degenerates but also with two women rescuers an older co worker who feeds and comforts him after he loses his job through his coke compulsion and the young college co ed cousin of his side kick She is the wholesome morally upright counterpart to his wife who seems to have done nothing but use him to launch her career Another important relationship and one which is exposed through flashbacks is one with his mother who has died from cancer a year previously These nascent relationships would seem to give the moviemakers a wealth of material upon which to draw but unfortunately this movie is so concerned with the cocaine message that resolving the problems with the relationships or even developing them well enough so that we can fully understand them is crudely sacrificed These intriguing relationships are immolated to a simplistic and Hollywoodesque public service message that drug abuse is no good On the other hand one of the few reasons for the present day drug epidemic is given by one of Fox s alcoholic co workers played wonderfully by Jason Robards At a liquid lunch he says something to the effect that Fox should get an MBA and write about money instead of trying to write fiction Money greed is the latter day poetry he says However didactic this may seem in context it works The major flaw with the premise for this movie is that you can t just bring up relationships get the audience interested in them and then leave them all unresolved even if that is part of the message These relationships proved more interesting for me than the perforated septum Fox s character gets near the end I wanted to know more about them than about his obsessive and disgusting habit But with all its faults BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY is worth seeing Fox shows that he really may have some genuine acting ability and the character actors that populate the recesses of the movie are simply wonderful Although the direction leaves lots of room for improvement and the the James Bridges revamp of Jay McInerney s script has its share of faults all in all it s worth seeing especially at the 2 houses where it is presently making the rounds If it weren t trying to go in two directions at the same time I think this movie could have hit big
0289,Saigon: Year of the Cat,1983,Some people seem to be tired of Vietnam War movies already but in actuality that subject contains a rich vein of artistic material that remains untapped Just because we ve seen several movies on what it was like to be a foot soldier in the U S Army in Vietnam during the late 1960 s doesn t mean that all that should be said has been said On the other hand just because a film happens to view the Vietnam War from a new or even a worthy angle doesn t mean that everyone should go out and see it SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT is a case in point No other Vietnam War movie has really looked at what happened when South Vietnam began to collapse unless you count BRADDOCK MISSING IN ACTION III and let s not And as parts of SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT demonstrate it s a fascinating subject full of rich thematic material drama and irony But SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT blows its opportunity by relying on a trite foreground story while relegating all of the interesting stuff to the background Not surprisingly it doesn t work too well SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT opens with credits and an introductory title card that seem straight out of the fifties mysterious Asia high adventure all that rousing imperialist nonsense Immediately it settles down to its real business more respectable but less entertaining What the film really wants us to do is follow a rather dull middle aged British bank officer The only interesting thing about her life is that she is about to have an affair with a CIA agent and the only interesting parts of the film are those that abandon her and follow the agent If writer David Hare and director Stephen Frears had been willing to jettison this boring narrator they might have had something Alternately they could have made some attempt to make her an interesting person They did neither and her effect on the film is soporific Fortunately halfway through the film she s almost forgotten The North Vietnamese are on the move the South is cracking up the American ambassador is living in a fantasy all the Vietnamese who cooperated with the Americans are beginning to panic and the CIA agent surprisingly more hero than villain fears that his country will put things off too long and leave all their friends to the mercy of the Communists This section of the film has tension energy and intelligence If the whole film had been built around this conflict the film would have been very fine indeed But SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT is a British film not an American one An obvious characteristic of almost all American films is that they are about Americans the main characters are Americans and the focus of the film is almost always on their concerns Only certain historical films and some non Hollywood independent films seem able to break through this myopia Similarly this British film seems compelled to insert a British observer though she is totally out of place and completely peripheral to the film s interests Now I have some idea of how Indonesians must feel when they see THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY or the French when they see FRANTIC or Chileans when they see MISSING A strong performance might have overcome poor writing in this central character but Judi Dench plays the part as if she was tired of the role before she even started it She shows no energy and fails to make the audience see why it should care about her life Contrasting that is the fine performance Frederick Forrest gives as the reluctant CIA agent He seems to be attempting something of a Bogart tribute and his is certainly the sort of part Bogart excelled in Forrest makes the picture live whenever he s on the screen provided Dench is not She is able to throw a bucket of cold water even on his performance Josef Somer adds another bad CIA man performance to his record E G Marshall is convincingly deluded as the U S ambassador and Wallace Shawn is as so often dispensable Roger Rees has a brief part in which he tries his best to convince us that he s crazy over Dench He had much better luck with Nicholas Nickleby Stephen Frears doesn t really have much of a feel for this kind of material He s better off working with more fully developed characters in a script about people rather than events MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE showed his talents to much better advantage than SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT does Still he does get into the spirit of the thing once Saigon really begins to fall apart and he stages some very memorable scenes in the U S Embassy as the last Americans are pulling out in panic His cinematographer Jim Howlett abets him in this well and also gives Forrest s performance a lift by cleverly using shadows on his face to suggest the darkness and secrecy of Forrest s world David Hare s script is the big problem Even at the film s best the story never seems very well organized and the central construction of the script works to weaken the film As in the adaptation of his play PLENTY Hare focuses on an unlikeable heroine In this film though the heroine is not only unlikeable but also tedious In addition the script assures a slow start since nothing really happens until an hour into the film Hare s dialog is nothing special either which is quite disappointing from an internationally known playwright SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT actually predates the recent rash of American Vietnam movies having been shot in the mid 80 s Predating the wave isn t going to make any difference to American distributors or American audiences though and SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT is not terribly likely to find favor with either Half a good movie isn t enough for most people and that s what SAIGON YEAR OF THE CAT has to offer
0290,Biloxi Blues,1988,Capsule review Matthew Broderick recreates his stage role as Eugene Jerome who goes to boot camp in Mississippi The film s greatest virtue is the portrayal of the troubled and enigmatic platoon sergeant It s greatest fault is that the enigma is side stepped rather than solved Still this is a credible view of a World War II army boot camp Rating high 1 There are lots of comedies about life in the military There are films like MR ROBERTS STALAG 17 BUCK PRIVATES STRIPES and PRIVATE BENJAMIN The first two may have been written by someone who actually had been in the military Somehow the last three show very little sign that anyone in their production knew or cared what army life was about STRIPES is a Bill Murray comedy set in the Army as opposed to be an army comedy starring Bill Murray No problem Bill Murray has lots of fans and one setting for his comedy is as good as another But I can see a MR ROBERTS or a STALAG 17 over and over Watching STRIPES once while reading a magazine was plenty for me Whoever wrote it had a really solid understanding of Bill Murray humor The writer of MR ROBERTS gave more of an impression of knowing the military Someone else who had been in the military and knew it was Neil Simon His BILOXI BLUES is not shallow is not stereotyped and gives the feel that much of it might have happened BILOXI BLUES follows the boot camp experiences of Eugene Morris Jerome played by Matthew Broderick and his interactions with his sergeant played by Christopher Walken and the other men in his platoon especially Arnold Epstein an intellectual the barracks butt and the only Jew in the platoon apart from Jerome himself But the character who steals the show is the sergeant His enigmatic and idiosyncratic ways of building discipline are the core of the film and overhang nearly every scene His character is unfortunately much too easily dismissed by the events of the climax of the film so we never really come to understand him The mystery of why he chooses such odd and intriguing lessons of discipline is never adequately explained BILOXI BLUES is not a great military comedy but it is probably the best thing director Mike Nichols has done in quite a long time Neil Simon adapted and rumor has it greatly modified his own autobiographical play At least three actors repeat their stage roles Besides Broderick Penelope Ann Miller returns to the part of Jerome s first love and Matt Mulhern repeats as Jerome s sometime nemesis Wykowski But even in this modified version one has the feeling that this film is based on something real not fabricated as a backdrop Rate it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0291,Whoops Apocalypse,1986,WHOOPS APOCALYPSE Great Britain 1986 Director Tom Bussman Screenwriters Andrew Marshall David Renwick Cast Loretta Swit Peter Cook Michael Richards Rik Mayall Alexei Sayle Herbert Lom WHOOPS APOCALYPSE is a hybrid of British humor I think it could be described as two parts Spitting Image two parts NOT NECESSARILY THE NEWS a shot of Monty Python and a jigger of Benny Hill While many parts of it work more than you would expect really it seems to lack a cohesiveness of style Monty Python might have been comic guerilla warfare but it was constantly loony you never got Bob Hope whoopie jokes thrown in Basically this is something of a takeoff on the British Argentina situation of a few years ago After a small British colony is invaded by its neighboring right wing dictatorship the British invade the country to regain it In the midst of this an international terrorist kidnaps the royal princess provoking the PM a complete loony wonderfully played by Peter Cook to threaten a nuclear strike against the dictatorship if the princess returned in 48 hours Meanwhile the President Loretta Swit tries to calm both allies not wanting to offend either side since they re both tough on communism Well you get the idea Best parts include the entire premise that while Cook is off his nut his insane right wing policies are supported without question by the rest of the country and the anti terrorist squad bit which goes over the top several times but is generally pretty good Much of the humor isn t predictable and that goes a long way for me I suspect this will appear on HBO or Showtime sometime soon if it hasn t already It s certainly worth the time to tape it and play it back if only for the closing credits Not a classic but good violent humor where little children get punched out by Secret Service agents My type of film
0292,One Hour with You,1932,Director Ernst Lubitsch assisted by George Cukor Screenwriter Samson Raphaelson based on a play by Lothar Schmidt Cast Maurice Chevalier Jeanette McDonald Genevieve Tobin Roland Young Charles Ruggles I must admit I am not a fan of the musicals Sure the Gene Kelly films are watchable especially AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and SINGIN IN THE RAIN what did they feed Donald O Connor in those days Rocket fuel And while most Astaire movies can t hold my interest all the way through they contain moments of pure open mouthed miracles But that s mostly due to the dancing Any film where an actor suddenly looks to the upper left or right corner of the screen opens his or her mouth and begins to warble causes me to roll my eyes heavenward First I m not much of a lyric appreciator and secondly the performances are very unconvincing Mainly though how many of your friends explain their feelings to you in song In the middle of a crowded railway station I think you see my point ONE HOUR WITH YOU however has several things that make it bearable through its length Ernst Lubitsch directed with an assist by George Cukor Hollywood s all around handyman director The lead actor is Maurice Chevalier and while he may be corny at times he is corny with such enthusiasm and with this out RAGEOUS French Accent you stupid English types that you can t help smiling There are even a few tunes that I was enjoying Oh that Mitzi is played to the hilt and Lubitsch manages to get an extra martial dalliance past the censors the man was unmatched in getting sophisticated humor to the audiences of his day The supporting cast is fine with Jeanette MacDonald showing none of the sappiness of her Nelson Eddy days and two of the best supporting comic actors of the day Charles Ruggles and Roland Young It s fluff but it digests easily and doesn t outstay its welcome They certainly don t do it like that anymore
0293,Yeelen,1987,Director Screenwriter Souleymane Cisse Cast Issiaka Kane Niamanto Sanogo Aoua Sangare Soumba Traore I spent a lot of my formative years hanging around the Bowie Public library in Maryland haunting the adult and young adult stacks for the latest subject that had piqued my interest sharks UFOs parapsychology After an hour or two of rummaging while Mom was off at the Food Giant I would make a short detour into the children s section examining the folklore sections for any new additions English Irish Czech Polish German Chinese Russian and French stories told in these countries were are a pleasure to me many were very similar to one another despite the differences between cultures but each had a distinct air which made the common elements more interesting While I read African folktales less frequently I found them on average to be more diverse the elements which were found in so many other cultures folklore were absent or seen under a very different light They were more exotic and mystical yet also more direct Watching the first two thirds of BRIGHTNESS is like curling up with a book of Kenyan folktales and letting your imagination wander as you read them BRIGHTNESS tells the story of a boy and his mother who have been chased all their lives by the father a powerful magician who wants the boy dead a family tradition it seems The boy leaves his mother to seek out his uncle and beg his aid and this is where the film is most enjoyable as it follows his journeys A magician in his own right the boy converses with various spirits casts spells helps a king and takes a wife the elements of several classic folktales pop up throughout it The last one third however stretches out for too long and frankly I didn t quite understand what happened The ending the enigmatic feel of 2001 and I was wondering whether the director was trying to sneak in some message about nuclear war If he did it was obscure enough not to be apparent I am assuming my ignorance of the culture is the reason I didn t get the ending For anyone enjoying folklore especially African folktales this is a beautiful example of one being brought to film Others may find it too slow for their tastes For me it was like a story told around the fire unfolding leisurely but stopping to look by the wayside as it moves along
0294,Midnight Crossing,1988,Director Roger Holzberg Screenwriters Roger Holzberg Doug Weiser Cast Faye Dunaway Daniel J Travanti John Laughlin Kim Cattrall Ned Beatty In the words of Leonard Pinth Garnell Really awful I don t mean unsuccessful or poorly done or a disappointment I mean raccoon liver oil sitting out under the sun for five weeks Downwind The last half hour had the audience in stitches during the most suspenseful moments and from the opinions expressed by my fellow full season pass holders I would guess that this is the worst film of the festival so far In short we have a young couple John Laughlin and Kim Cattrall who own a large sailboat in South Florida Cattrall s boss and his blind wife Daniel J Travanti Faye Dunaway wish to hire the couple to sail them to the Caribbean for their 20th wedding anniversary or do they Turns out Laughlin s dad and Tranvanti stored a bunch of Cuban gambling money off an island before Castro took power in 1959 And Cattrall has been doing more than just selling insurance in Travanti s firm Basically you have these people who are either slugs Travanti sluts Cattrall flakes Dunaway or bumpkins Laughlin all trying to get the money I was personally hoping Ellis Ned Beatty an old sailor who overhears their plans in a cantina and Knows More Than He s Telling would just sink their ship and let us out of the theater But no The dialogue here is poor but the plot Roger Holzberg and Doug Weiser must have thought they were producing DEATHTRAP at sea Instead it twists so many times into so many ridiculous impossible plot twists including the happy ending that s tacked on that you wish there were zombies or ghosts or some supernatural forces behind this then it might make some sense Cattrall s third soft porn scene Dunaway s outrageous over acting as she tries to convince Laughlin that Travanti is out to kill him Travanti chasing Dunaway around the boat with two speargun spears in him they breed em tough on The Hill Everyone screaming at everyone else while they re all mortally wounded on the deck As to why we saw this film and why the soundtrack a fast track generic pop rock ditty was played overly loud before the film started I must point out that Dan Ireland one of the two people who started the festival now working for Vestron pictures was one of the executive producers for this film Come to think of it Dan s brought in some really lousy pictures over the last couple of years that he s been involved in SHADEY comes to mind immediately Danno your credit s wearing a mite thin around these parts Considering the reaction the audience gave this and that this was the World Premiere of the film I wonder if it will get out at all or in the shape we saw it
0295,White Mischief,1987,WHITE MISCHIEF Great Britain 1987 Director Michael Radford Screenwriters Michael Radford Jonathan Gems based on the book WHITE MISCHIEF by James Fox Cast Joss Ackland Greta hubba hubba Scacchi Charles Dance Sarah Miles John Hurt Susan Fleetwood Geraldine Chaplin Trevor Howard I ve been trying to think of whether to classify this as a drama comedy or mystery instead I think I ll just label it British and leave it at that Brother is it British cliche British throughout though that seems to be the intention The story centers around a beautiful young woman Scacchi who marries a much older landowner Ackland for his money in 1940 and travels with him to his estates in Kenya Here the war is incredibly distant there are no shortages and most people are living decadently if not hedonistically An odd group of characters reside there and in the center is a statuesquely handsome rake Dance who has had affairs with almost all the sought after British women in the colony He seeks after the young wife almost immediately and they become lovers in a stereotypically formal British manner The elder husband tries to ignore being cuckolded in his best old boy manner but soon he realizes he has lost her to his younger competition Suddenly the younger man is found murdered in his car and the husband is brought to trial The rest of the film deals with the aftermath of the murder and the revelation of who the murderer is The resolution is not particularly satisfying nor does it make much sense but that s not the appeal of the film WHITE MISCHIEF s greatest appeal is to put a series of veteran British actors before the camera in rather bizarre roles and give them witty lines to deliver for 90 minutes There are some wonderfully quotable bits here the kind that used to be delivered in sophisticated drawing room mystery comedies The film would almost fit into the proper British mysteries of Tey Christie and the like but there really are no sympathetic characters The young wife is mercantile the husband rather pathetic the lover imperiously superior and his ex mistresses are loony though Sarah Miles carries the day when on screen The only two neutral characters are Hurt as a rich farm owner who has gone native and the late Trevor Howard as the elder husband s rather pachyderm like friend The main point though is the bizarre humor mostly resulting from everyone s exaggerated stiff upper lip manner By the end of the film the events of the film have driven the young wife almost around the bend LINER NOTES The young African boy whose face closes out the film is by coincidence the same actor who played the innocent protagonist of THE KITCHEN TOTO Seems to add extra symbolism to the end Short WORDS by Chuck Workman USA 1987 Last year Chuck Workman put together clips of over three hundred films into a short named PRECIOUS IMAGES for the celebration of the Director s Guild It was one of my favorite shorts and is a real treat for any movie lover This year he has another one for the Screen Writer s Guild filled with 235 famous lines from film and TV over the last sixty years Does anyone know where I could buy a tape with either PRECIOUS IMAGES or WORDS on it preferably both I d love to have a copy of this at home
0296,Stand and Deliver,1987,Telling a newsgroup populated by computer scientists and mathematicians that STAND AND DELIVER side note I cannot say this without thinking of John Cleese as Dennis Moore is entertaining is rather like advising basketball fans to see HOOSIERS you ve got a pretty good shot that the readers will agree with you However in this case the film has other things going for it than the subject i e a teacher who inspires a group of East L A Chicano kids to study math and take the A P advanced calculus tests It has some complex entertaining characters good acting and a story which is exciting to watch Seeing kids becoming enthused over learning and watching their confidence bloom over their intellectual abilities is great viewing material and it s handled well here Edward James Olmos does a wonderful job as the math teacher who pushes his students and himself hard perhaps too hard at times and shows his pupils their parents and the school that limits defined by class background and race are non existent That the film is based on a true story seems almost irrelevant anyone watching the film would know that it either did happen or could happen It s just nice to be reminded of that fact

0298,Kitchen Toto The,1987,THE KITCHEN TOTO Great Britain 1987 Director Screenwriter Harry Hook Cast Bob Peck Phyllis Logan Edwin Mahinda Kristen Hughes THE KITCHEN TOTO details the life of a young African boy living in Kenya in 1950 His father the village minister is killed for not supporting a group of tribesman who are intent on ridding themselves of the British colonial rule His mother sends him to work as the kitchen toto the kitchen boy in the home of the local British military constable He soon finds himself trapped between trying to live in the British way which is relatively pleasant but where is he is wronged again and again by his employers and the gangster like terrorists who make up the Mau Mau revolutionaries He struggles to live neutrally between the two factions only to be drawn deeper into the Mau Mau sect The film opens with a scene of native children being treated to Christmas gifts by the British colonists It is a cheery portrait the kind generous landowners entertaining their African wards and servants Indeed there are benevolent British characters here people who believe that they are helping their primitive brethren to civilization The distinction of the film is how it shows that even the best of intentions contribute to the desecration of a people or peoples For the whites in this film are degraded by the same imperialism that humiliates their black countrymen their foibles and ignorance is put on display and they defend it out of fear of losing control over their subjects The film shows how even the least slight which would be nothing more than a social faux pas in a equal society can develop into the most tragic circumstances It s unnecessary to underline the validity of the film s message I can t imagine there is anyone on the net stupid enough to champion Arpartheid like regimes but I have to credit the film for its enormous skill in bringing the message across There are no stereotypes no easily digested characters it shows how an innocent is persecuted tortured and eventually destroyed by bigotry and its repercussions The cinematography is excellent as the darkness of the jungle seems to touch every shot the director has done a film without any wasted motions Every year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts gives out rewards to message films I wish the majority of them were as effective as THE KITCHEN TOTO It makes its point without pandering or stooping to entertain as it goes along Instead a story is told in a way that makes its point very clearly There are some people is South Africa whom I think should see THE KITCHEN TOTO Soon and for their own sakes as well as others LINER NOTES This is the second small quality film I ve seen this year to be released by Cannon Golan Globas They do seem to import some good international works to go along with HE MAN and Chuck Norris latest flag waver
0299,Dominick and Eugene,1988,DOMINICK AND EUGENE United States 1988 Director Robert M Young Screenwriters Alvin Sargent and Corey Blechman Cast Tom Hulce Ray Liotta Jamie Lee Curtis Todd Graff This I believe is a good sign When a film this good appears this early in the festival it usually means that statistically other good stuff will follow And DOMINICK AND EUGENE is the best film to appear at the SIFF so far it s the best film I ve seen this year for that matter By the time I ve written this and posted it it will be in your local theater and my one recommendation is GO SEE IT You will not be disappointed The film tells the story of two brothers living together in Pittsburgh Eugene Liotta is an intern at a local hospital Nicky Hulce is a garbageman putting his younger by 12 minutes brother through school Nicky is slow a lumbering child who s simple nature and gentleness is endearing to those around him a family friend tells Eugene that Nicky is God s child When Eugene is offered a chance to study at Stanford he is torn with the idea of either leaving Nicky on his own or uprooting him to take him to California The situation is complicated as he begins a romantic affair with another intern Curtis who has an enviable track record for appearing in excellent films And finally there is a situation that Nicky stumbles upon that has haunting repercussions to both his and Eugene s past I haven t a criticism of this film Not one The story unfolds carefully bringing the audience into the small group of friends it walks the fine line of sentiment without ever becoming cloying The dialogue is wonderful funny startling heartrending And the acting this film is an actor s treat Curtis performs the task again of creating an immediately likable character without artifice Tod Graff as Nicky s co worker and eventually pal Larry balances being a jerk and a friend with precision and charm he underscores Nicky s particular talents and in the end you realize that Nicky is less intelligent than Larry in only a few areas I haven t enjoyed this kind of role so much since James Woods played Aldo in EYEWITNESS Ray Liotta SOMETHING WILD is perfect as a man who is torn between his love for his brother his fear for their future and his memories of the past His performance is the very definition of the word controlled In any other film his work would stand out as phenomenally good here he meets and matches the high level of quality seen elsewhere in the film Tom Hulce Mozart in AMADEUS ECHO PARK however is the thing one carries away from DOMINICK AND EUGENE As Nicky his performance is hell I can t come up with an adjective that won t sound overblown Inspired to the point of genius He is be able to be a child a man frustrated and courageous and an innocent concurrently and without a seam The line between actor and character are never there Hulce is Nicky and when he becomes riveting it seems entirely in character And he is electrifying here I can imagine no other actor who could have pulled this role off not after viewing Hulce s performance anyway There is a scene where the camera stays on Hulce s face for several minutes inter cut with scenes that appear from his point of view he says nothing his face is in shock and he can not be looked away from Amazing There are lines which are every bit as emotionally rending as anything Marlon Brando did in Hulce s mouth Over the last few years I ve come to the conclusion that the Academy Awards are royally fucked but if Hulce isn t nominated for Best Actor they need to have their collected membership put out on an iceflow From where I sit it seems unlikely that a performance of this caliber will occur over the next year This surpasses the last stand out performance I can remember in film Klaus Maria Brandaeur in MEPHISTO by a good ways Hulce s role as Nicky will be a milestone for years to come PS I can t see not enjoying this film as entertainment so don t be put off by my accolades This is a movie worth seeing several times over LINER NOTES Hulce Director Young and producer Marvin Minoff were there afterwards The level of questions was even poorer than usual Hey Tom you married Did you become emotionally involved with your character during the filming of DOMINICK AND EUGENE Please if you re ever at a film festival don t ask people questions just to hear the sound of your voice The film should be in the theaters when I write this saw the Film Festival showing last week wish I could have gotten it out sooner but
0301,Ben-Hur,1925,BEN HUR United States 1925 silent Director Fred Niblo Screenwriters Carey Wilson Bess Meredyth Cast Ramon Novarro May McAvoy Francis X Bushman Well all in all I d rather be in Philadelphia This print of the 1925 silent epic a film which almost broke Sam Goldwyn and MGM is certainly of interest to the film historian archivist and anyone who needs reminding of why so few silent dramas are still shown It s been a while since I ve seen BIRTH OF A NATION this production of BEN HUR made Griffith s masterpiece look restrained in comparison The actor playing Ben Hur resembled a younger version of John Lovitz s Master Thespian character on SNL you can just see him winking to the other actors and actresses and whispering I was only ACTING As to the plot it appears to be Hollywood s effort to turn the Easter story into a Western After beating his Roman enemy in the chariot races Ben Hur becomes the richest man in all the world He raises two great armies that will help Christ overthrow the Roman Empire Chapter IV The evil Pontius Pilate is building a giant Death Coliseum to destroy the rebel Christian Alliance But then word comes to him that Pilate is condemning Christ to death Hur leaps onto his horse yells for his men to follow him and speeds away to Jerusalem Will he make it in time Frankly I thought SILVERADO did it better There are other humorous parts Ben s mom and sister have become lepers and wherever they go people yell Lepers lepers in such a way that I was reminded of Monty Python s Llamas Llamas bit And like many films before 1950 Jesus s face is never shown what s exceptional about BEN HUR is how clumsy they are at avoiding it You either see only his hands sticking out of the side of the picture like Mr Hands on the Mr Bill Show or they block his face with someone standing in front of him This could have been done realistically but it culminates in a scene of the Last Supper where some guy the waiter stands in front of Christ during the entire scene All you can see is his halo like a nimbus around the blocking actor wouldn t it have been easier simply to put a black square in front of his face like they do on 60 MINUTES The Technicolor parts of the film are interesting 1925 is about the earliest I ever heard of color being shown in theaters It s used strictly for the scenes straight out of the Testament and it gives them a rather gospel like look they resemble the illustrations you find in religious children s books The chariot races scene is exciting also But it won t keep you entertained for 2 hours so I d generally say skip it except to the most serious historian LINER NOTES I stuck around to see the short preceding the next film it was Bill Plympton s newest animated short ONE OF THOSE DAYS Unlike YOUR FACE this was a straight forward cartoon short where various pratfalls accidents and misfortunes befall a fellow we see everything from the fellows point of view Rather like a Tom Jerry cartoon except that Plympton s art makes it funnier Nothing exceptional though
0302,Hope and Glory,1987,Having been tremendously impressed by John Boorman s work on THE EMERALD FOREST I went to see HOPE AND GLORY over the weekend and true to the reviews I had read previously it is a very realistic and convincing evocation of the World War II era in England as seen through the eyes John Boorman the child There is humor pathos tenderness and lots of other endearing virtues to this movie What there is not is drama Even if we don t agree with our imperfect institutions such as the law government the political economy there are historical reasons why they developed the way they did Likewise in film the structure of the screenplay has developed through years of experimentation trial and error relationships shared with other forms of drama as well as many other reasons To challenge such collective wisdom requires the true force of historic genius pushed to an inevitable clash with what has gone before it and through such a clash is born the advancement of the human race However for me HOPE AND GLORY is not such an event even though John Boorman has chosen to challenge them in this film The essence of drama is the clash of the human will against obstacles the testing of just what it means to be a man or a woman In this process our human condition is illuminated Now it is rather obvious that we share certain things with the animals physical bodies a certain level of emotional life etc it is equally certain that there are things which we don t share things which make us uniquely human Lest I digress too much by way of example let me say that I greatly enjoy movies about nature but for me for the most part nature films are unable to create true drama just because they lack this testing this probing and searching out of the good the bad and the ugly of the human will So too reminiscences no matter how wonderful how evocative how well crafted are not drama if they lack this crucial testing and this I feel is a major weakness of HOPE AND GLORY To be sure it has lots of other virtues virtues which others have amply pointed out I offer this merely as something to think about if you haven t already seen the film or are going to see it again Both my wife and eleven year old daughter liked the film more than I did so I thought I d try to put down in words just what it is that bothers me about it As film history progresses we will perhaps see the advent of new forms of filmic story telling It s an exciting thought HOPE AND GLORY however takes us in some ways a step backwards
0303,Last Emperor The,1987,Admittedly I saw this movie in my local 2 house where the picture wouldn t fit on the screen so the right hand side wrapped around the wall and waved on a curtain Although an interesting distraction especially when the emperor appeared to be literally two faced I think I saw enough of the film to give my views on this Sino Latin collaboration One of the nice things about movie reviews is that they are often refreshingly wrong I feel this is because when we see a film we filter it through our own unique set of life experiences and the things we see are those things to which we have become sensitive sort of like a group of allergy patients sitting in a doctor s office I am no exception The things I see you may say don t exist in the film or vice versa This is a healthy phenomenon So as a word of caution if you haven t already seen this movie go see it for yourself don t believe critics One man s meat is another man s poison as the saying goes I myself however always read and believe criticisms As Luis Bunuel I m sure would comment about one of our national weaknesses Those poor naive Americans Being half English and half Italian has already made me the type who would shout Long live the King and then take out a gun and shoot the bastard Just joking I think Anyway here are some of my ideas about the film The movie was hard to watch It was colder than a winter in Chicago Nonetheless although I don t think I could sit through it again it makes important comments about the lunacy of political power and as it offers no alternatives other than awareness of the problem it is dreadful in its implications The story as the title suggests is about the life of the last emperor of China As a three year old he is installed in The Forbidden City and everyone bows down to him He quickly gets the idea that he is superior to others and can do almost anything he wants This is shown in the film to be correct and incorrect at the same time Within The Forbidden City a symbol of the emperor s own imprisonment he is free to do whatever he wants but he is indeed not free to leave He is a puppet if you will to protect the interests of those who put him in power in the first place Sound familiar One very striking shot near the opening shows the young emperor and his brother who has been allowed to visit him at the head of a long retinue of heavily robed functionaries dias bearers and so forth The emperor starts running across an extremely expansive stone paved courtyard The retinue speeds up to try and follow and they all end up going in a huge circle in the courtyard The camera observes this from on high to emphasize how small they are a bit of directorial virtuosity which caught me by surprise The emperor leading the people in circles I wonder where that idea came from While the emperor is thus cut off from the rest of the world China becomes a republic and the emperor becomes aware that it now has a president The feeling of his own imprisonment grows Eventually the emperor gets a tutor from Scotland who encourages him to free himself The emperor now around twenty fires the old guard and installs a person to do an inventory on how much has been stolen from the storehouse The eunuchs hundreds of them burn the storehouse to the ground The emperor says that this is to cover their thieving and in a strange scene in which the eunuchs carry their testicles in phials out into the courtyard wishing to be buried as whole men we are lead to believe that they will be executed although thankfully we don t have to witness the mass executions Apparently showing them would have made the emperor too hateful to the audience and interfered with the main theme which I will get to The film is largely based on the political history of China As such it follows the emperor s life into the period when he collaborated with the Japanese in Manchuria It is a sad life in which the enslavement of China has its parallel in the enslavement of the emperor he is merely a puppet again this time in the hands of the Japanese When the Communists take over the emperor is caught and spends ten years in prison being reeducated eventually becoming a gardener and dying in 1967 Ironically the Communist who reeducates him is portrayed as a kind teacher who has a profound humanity Later as the emperor walks the streets he sees the jailer forced to march in a parade of denunciation in which he is humiliated the vagaries of politics The emperor stands up for him but is in turn ridiculed by the young Chinese cultural revolutionaries who are just as much under the spell of an illusion as the emperor ever was The circle is complete The emperor has gone from illusion to disillusionment to awareness only now to be ridiculed by the young Chinese Communist guards just starting off on their own period of illusion During the emperor s reeducation the moviemakers mix in footage of real atrocities such as the mass opium addiction of the Chinese real executions as well as the attack on Pearl Harbor and the atomic bomb blast at Hiroshima This ties the movie more than anything else to our own reality So is this picture a cinematic version of Machiavelli In some ways it is Human nature doesn t change certainly a view of Machiavelli The emperor loves Manchuria Machiavelli was a passionate lover of Florence The corrupt nature of humanity is certainly present but perhaps it is best not to drive the parallels too far for the emperor s life is ultimately seen from the point of view of a long period spent under the spell of an illusion and his equally long period before breaking out of this psychic prison His struggle consumed his whole life The implication I think is that ours could consume the whole world From almost any angle this movie is first rate It even had a moment or two of humor as when a Chinese band plays its version of Auld Lang Syne as a send off for the emperor s Scotch tutor I don t quite know what to say about the coldness of the film In one way it is totally apropos it fits the subject matter perfectly On the other hand who wants to go see a cold movie All I can say is that I am really glad to have seen this important film I would compare it to going to the dentist s office to have your teeth drilled necessary but not exactly an endearing experience I salute the moviemakers this is a stupendous and important film In a world asleep in its illusions political power may just be the greatest oxyMORON of all
0304,Out of Rosenheim,1988,European directors seem to be fascinated with the American desert After all there is nothing like it in Europe German director Percy Adlon came to America and made BAGDAD CAFE There s been nothing like it on the screen before This off center gem discovers what happens when a corpulent German tourist played by Marianne Sagebrecht breaks up with her husband in the desert of Southern California She wanders into the Bagdad Oil and Gas Cafe and into the lives of a ill tempered woman played beautifully by CCH Pounder and her bizarre extended family The only name you ll recognize is Jack Palance as the weird old painter from Hollywood Other members of the menagerie include a tattoo artist who is very popular with the truck drivers a son with a bent for classical piano a daughter who comes and goes with an assortment of lowlife men and a boomerang throwing backpacker BAGDAD CAFE is a film that grows on you My relationship with the film paralleled the relationship of the two women At first I hated it It started out so badly that I thought they accidentally projected the second reel first Starting abruptly it was full of gratuitously tilted cameras staccato edits and mumbled German Oh brother How did I get talked into watching this movie The first ray of hope was the haunting theme music and a memorable image of the woman entranced by eerie lights in the sky Before I was aware Brenda the slovenly cafe owner had been won over by the genuine and compulsively neat Jasmine So had I Through a series of whimsical and strange vignettes BAGDAD CAFE worked its magic By the end of the movie I was completely hooked This is not mainstream belly laugh comedy but I will be smiling or laughing about some of the images for a long time BAGDAD CAFE is a must see for devotees of the off beat If you think a movie just isn t a comedy if it doesn t have Eddie Murphy in it stay home If on the other hand you still remember scenes from CHOOSE ME or TROUBLE IN MIND you better search this one out Island Pictures bless them is distributing but I don t know how wide a release BAGDAD CAFE will get I hope it comes to a theatre near you
0305,Killing Affair A,1988,When one goes to a film festival one expects to see films that normally wouldn t show up anywhere else Some of them might be too unusual or different for general release either because of the filmmakers idiosyncrasies or because of deep cultural differences between the filmmakers and the audience Some might be overly ambitious failures Some might be masterpieces by unsung geniuses Some might be godawful messes that were included for reasons beyond the ken of all but the festival committee What one doesn t expect is mediocre Hollywood filler Which is why A KILLING AFFAIR was so surprising when it showed up at the AFI Festival Basically A KILLING AFFAIR is suspense film with little to distinguish it from any of the other 100 American suspense films released in the last year About the only interesting feature is that it s set in rural West Virginia during World War II but little in the story or characters arises from the time or place so the setting is no more than local color Otherwise the film unwinds in precisely the same way that all of its brethren do The story concerns a woman who is alone in a secluded house menaced by a mysterious stranger Her husband a womanizing cad is away across the river and she doesn t know when he ll return The only neighbor a mile away doesn t want to get involved The ferry is too far and there aren t any boats around So she must deal with the stranger by herself And as the film progresses the role of the stranger becomes more complicated than a mere boogeyman The setup lacks originality but is a reasonable base for a suspense story The execution unfortunately is totally ordinary David Saperstein who also wrote the film shows a journeyman s talent in his first directorial effort Everything hangs together reasonably well the camerawork isn t terrible the pacing is acceptable the acting satisfactory A KILLING AFFAIR gives the feeling of a director who relied too heavily on the rest of the crew It looks like the cinematographer did pretty much what he felt was right the editor cut it his own way the composer made all the musical decisions and the actors followed their own instincts without anyone exerting a unifying force on the film That is the director s task Saperstein seems to have stood back too far allowing able professionals to handle routine jobs rather than convincing them that more than the routine was demanded Probably the strongest element of the film is Peter Weller s performance as the mysterious stranger He demonstrates as he did in FIRSTBORN and SHOOT THE MOON a fine ability to combine menace and attraction Unfortunately the script ultimately requires some pretty bizarre twists in the character and while Weller tries hard he s not quite able to pull them off Kathy Baker in the central role of the film fails almost from her first appearance While apparently an accomplished stage actress she is unable to find the key to making us care about her character We never sympathize with her or have a strong desire to see her removed from danger The character is written weak which made her task much harder This is the sort of role more suitable for an established screen performer as they can carry into the film a history that makes us empathize with the characters they play Saperstein s script is not well shaped Constrained by working from someone else s novel and apparently not a good one Saperstein failed to solve certain problems of the story Too many of the character s actions are unmotivated or stupid He also provides insufficient opportunities to develop suspense Neither does he do much to convince us of the period or place of the film The story could equally well be set anywhere with little or no change in dialog or plot Cinematography by Dominique Chapuis and editing by Patrick McMahon are professional and unengaged Any other of dozens of their compatriots could have filled in for them and produced exactly the same thing John Barry s score is also more professional than exciting A KILLING AFFAIR is destined for brief runs in theaters across the country It will probably be opened regionally and has already been shown in some parts of the US While the film has nothing really wrong with it it s hard to recommend such a resolutely average effort I suppose that Peter Weller fans might want to see it but others need not worry about missing out on anything If you absolutely have to see a movie and it s this or FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VII you would be much better off with A KILLING AFFAIR But then that s not saying much
0306,Lady in White,1988,Oddly enough while the ghost story is probably the most commonly written breed of horror story it is very uncommon as a type of horror film Perhaps there is a feeling that they do not translate well to film Ghost stories are usually mood pieces and directors who know how to capture moods generally have other kinds of films they want to make Ghost stories that have really worked on film have done so by hinting and by creating a let s be frank morbid mood in the audience The good ones have been THE HAUNTING THE INNOCENTS THE UNINVITED and perhaps THE CHANGELING Hmmm I never noticed before how similar the titles were Two films that definitely do not make it as ghost stories are GHOST STORY and POLTERGEIST While I liked POLTERGEIST it was really more science fiction on the astral plane than a ghost story Each of these two films has been too overpowering to make it as the subtle mood piece that a good ghost tale should be In fact of the classic ghost stories I mentioned only one was even in color The other three depended on a dark mood that is very hard to achieve in color Now a ghost story has come along on film that ranks with the classics perhaps even surpasses them LADY IN WHITE is a ghost story in color but it never overwhelms It is a very fine mood piece and the use of color in the film enhances the mood rather than fighting it And the story is worthy of the mood and the photography is worthy of the story LADY IN WHITE was written directed scored and produced by Frank LaLoggia That can be either a very good sign or a very bad sign in a low budget film LADY IN WHITE is very clearly one man s vision and dream brought to the screen I grew up in New England and I can tell you that no other place have I seen where autumn is so melodramatic The world turns bright hues of red and brown and yellow as it rages against the dying of the warm LaLoggia captures the melancholic autumn with a small town feel somewhere between that of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES Like those films this is a story of children and growth but it also raises gooseflesh in ways that are all too rare in horror films It is in fact the story of Frankie Scarlatti whom I suspect is made up in no small part of little Frankie LaLoggia from about 25 years ago Frankie loves Halloween and monsters of all sorts he tells such a good Halloween story of the prehysterical monster that stomps London that jealous classmates arrange for him to be locked in the cloakroom closet In the old school that has served generations years mean very little and he is visited by the spirit of a little girl his own age or she was when she died eleven years earlier a death that the spirit must re live over and over Even if the main story were not good and it is this would be a marvelously textured film Characters like Frankie s grandfather his father and his brother are drawn with a loving pen Frankie himself is played by Lucas Haas who young as he is is the veteran of films like TESTAMENT and WITNESS the film carries the viewer along often to unexpected vistas without making one false move until the final five minutes LaLoggia has problems ending the story without making it a little goofy and a little cliched But until the final minutes of the film LADY IN WHITE is a positive gem of filmmaking Even mistakes in the special effects work for the film Rate it an admiring 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0307,Aria,1987,This film isn t going to be widely realeased and that s too bad It s rated X or rated such that No one under 17 will be admitted and this is the kind of film that rated X was meant for Stuff like GRENDEL DOES THE GREEN BAY PACKERS should have its own rating ARIA is ten loosely linked segments each with a different director and a different musical score Verdi Puccini and Wagner are in there a lot Almost all of the segments are shot on location from a weightlifting room in Paris to the Madonna Motel in San Luis Obispo California Each segment is the director s interpretation of an opera piece Some of the segments are really fantastic The Tristan and Isolde starts with a young couple driving through an Arizon desertscape into Las Vegas and it s simply beautiful They drive down the strip we see the old ladies at the slot machines the odd people on the street the wedding chapels and the motel room In Jean Luc Godard s segment two young cleaning women in a Paris gym are ignored by muscle bound Narcissuses It s hilarious The idea behind the whole thing show modern people what opera felt like to the contemporaries of the composers is really executed well Usually I hate opera for once I loved it Released nationally but mostly in artsy places like the Varsity in Palo Alto CA 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0308,Willow,1988,WILLOW is the latest release from Lucasfilms and their best since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK George Lucas first solo story since STAR WARS A NEW HOPE is about a would be mage halfling Willow Warwick Davis who played Wicket in RETURN OF THE JEDI at age 11 who has adopted a baby found floating on a makeshift raft in the river It becomes apparent that she is the object of an intensive search set by the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda Jean Marsh and Willow is sent out with some reluctant companions by their local mage Billy Barty to bring the baby to safety On their way they encounter a rogue Madmartigan Val Kilmer as well as the Faerie Queen who informs them that their charge is the prophecied Princess who will bring their lands into better times and adds two 9 inch tall brownies to their companions though these prove as much hindrance as help Impeding their journey are hellish hunting hounds an evil barbarian general and the evil Queen s beautiful daughter Sarsha Joanne Whalley who is a great warrior herself Add to this formula a benevolent enchantress a troll beset castle and many of the classical trappings of faerie based sword sorcery and you have WILLOW If the plot and characters more than superficially resemble those in Star Wars that s OK those created for A NEW HOPE were faerie tale archetypal characters to begin with They seem just as home here if not more so The story line is fresh for Lucasfilms though and a welcome change What WILLOW is missing however is not so much the required sense of wonder as a sense of awe Remember the first time you saw the Imperial battlecruiser pass over your head But the story and action build very nicely indeed and it works Needless to say ILM and Sprocket Systems have again outdone themselves except for some minor quibbles I have which may be edited out or changed for the release prints that will go to theatres later this month when the film opens With WILLOW Ron Howard becomes the current premier director of science fantasy films and his direction is just fine There was talk that Lucas had taken over direction at one point during the Directors Guild strike last year but I don t think that counts for too much Anyway the two have been close friends ever since Howard starred in Lucas second feature AMERICAN GRAFITTI The photography by Adrian Biddle is lovely his work on ALIENS and THE PRINCESS BRIDE must have prepped him well for this effort Bob Dolman s screenplay is witty Outside of writing for WKRP in Cinncinati and the recent cable series POISON I doubt he has too many credits behind him The production notes don t even take the time to fill us in on him James Horner s soundtrack is little more than a John Williams rip which is a redundancy in and of itself and that s too bad I expected a little more from him Still I suspect he was working to order The incidental music in WILLOW s village festival sequence is written and performed by Ian Anderson and Robin Williamson and is delightful Overall I enjoyed WILLOW very much and could see it a few times an important criteria for Lucasfilms productions Despite the reported 40 million expense of making this film I don t think they ll have too much trouble making it back The ranch is saved
0309,White Mischief,1987,A lifestyle film par excellance This one however seems intent on exploring and contrasting a great number of lifestyles good ole boy wholesome British with underlying flaws female glitz seeker marries older man for money lots of sexually promiscuous consuming and debauched hedonists ranging from joy of excentricity druggies to brazen usurers African natives surviving the reign of self serving whites In the opening scenes a young woman exposes her lustful intent to chase money and title at whatever cost She is somehow wed to an old boy Brit with a large but threatened fortune He s old bald and pretty stiff She s young and sexy World War I quickly fades into the background as they move to Africa Immediately she sees a cute guy she wouldn t mind boffing All this is dished out in the first few minutes At this point all the various lifestyles come into play and contrast A great many crises ensue which seem only to give opportunity to explore the clash of lifestyles You don t get to know any of the characters as intimately as you might expect In fact much of the film you are left out of the know in a sort of free wheeling spectator s seat to watch what the various crazy people are doing Things escalate to an court trial then resolution of the major crises that have been raised Everybody seems to meet some sort of that s where your lifestyle takes you demon not entirely unlike BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY My theatre mates unfortunately all male like myself were quite happy to get the heck out of the theatre
0310,Manon des sources,1986,A few months ago I reviewed JEAN DE FLORETTE the film that makes up the first half of the film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Marcel Pagnol I refused to rate JEAN DE FLORETTE by itself because unlike some reviewers I did not feel it stood by itself as a story The story proceeds to a natural breaking point but a point unsatisfying as an end of a story MANON OF THE SPRING continues the story years later It works only slightly better as a self contained story and probably should not be rated by itself either We have essentially a single film and the parts should be separated by at most an intermission of an hour or so I cannot help feeling that even more of the story would fit together for me had I not allowed so long a time to elapse between seeing the two films As MANON OF THE SPRING begins Manon has grown into a beauty but has grown up a little wild in the hills where her father tried to build his farm There is some question as to how much she knows of the events that happened when she was a young girl Knowledge that the audience assumed she already knew comes to her as a revelation that brings her to tears It is only then that she starts plotting a revenge that I had earlier assumed she had years to think about the story is engrossing and credible through most of the film Then suddenly the plot twists again under the all too obvious hand of the storyteller Rather than a solid drama the film swerves into melodrama trying too hard for too contrived an ending But while the ending damages the credibility and dramatic power of the story it cannot damage the beautiful portrait of French village life This is a film in which the background is as compelling as the foreground In the final analysis how people live is of more interest than what the people do And the characters become more interesting as well Ugolin who is little more than a sidekick in the earlier comes into his own as a character His love for Manon the woman he had wronged years earlier is pitiful and yet compelling The viewer almost hopes that he can be forgiven the past and win Manon JEAN DE FLORETTE and MANON OF THE SPRING together make up a very good story that continues for nearly four hours without dragging Rate the pair 2 on the 4 to 4 scale If you can manage it see the two together
0312,Girltalk,1987,Credits Directed and Produced by Kate Davis Cinematography and Associate Directed by Alyson Denny Additional Photography by Richard Leacock Edited by Kate Davis and Alyson Denny Associate Producer Pat Gross Women s issues are paradoxically often defined by men and male dominated film industries offer few exceptions to this rule GIRLTALK is a refreshing change in that it is one of the few films about women s issues made by women By documenting the lives of three teenage runaway girls from Boston in an unflinching intuitive style without slick television style commentary the film ends up relying on the audience to decide which issues are and are not important Director producer editor Kate Davis and cinematographer editor Alyson Denny enlisted the help of youth service agencies runaway shelters and the police while searching for suitable subjects for the documentary After extensively combing the streets of Boston they ultimately found Pinky Mars and Martha What links the three girls together is their common history of abuse and neglect Pinky s father left home when she was small and her mother was judged to be a neglectful parent This 14 year old now refuses to go to school and is fascinated by pop music and anything pink She even wears pink Reeboks Martha was sexually abused by her foster father for six years Her mother was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic Now alone and pregnant at 18 she ended up living in over twenty foster homes and institutions after her father was sent to jail Mars father once threatened to take her to a motel room and break her in right Mars has been on the street since age 13 and she was once gang raped until she lost consciousness She now works as a stripper in the Combat Zone Boston s red light district where her specialty is to flip cartwheels lick lollipops and ride a tricycle in a disturbingly schoolgirlish fashion These harsh realities are presented however quite matter of factly through an unusual symbiosis between filmmaker and subject that hasn t been seen much since Jean Rouch s CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER 1961 Most cinema verite filmmakers these days endeavor to disguise or limit the camera s presence and influence on the unfolding events In this film however Davis and Denny seem more interested in transforming the filmmaking process into a healing mechanism to make a positive difference in the life of the girls For example Davis and Denny had the girls deliberately address the camera According to an article in the Windy City Times Davis told the girl that she would take care of them before and after filming that I wouldn t just run away to get it sold She even let the girls help edit the final cut of the film While this close link between filmmaker and subject removes any claim to journalistic objectivity it allows Davis and Denny to apply their integrity as filmmakers and human beings in directions quite different from the typical documentary The result is both candid and often painful Pinky seems the most uncomfortable with the film project because she remains the most enigmatic of the three Apart from introducing the viewer to childhood problems typical to many troubled teenagers and setting the tone for the rest of the film her presence in the film has little to reveal Asked why she likes being a girl she responds that Girls get more respect That s what I think The film is more effective in depicting the complexities of why Mars continues to work as a stripper It would be quite easy to blame her because it is apparent that she is not a drug addict or physically restrained to the bar she works in But the film goes on to reveal a hidden emotional tie to her work Mars claims that her schoolgirl routine is her way of becoming a child for the first time in her life When she calls the bartender Daddy or puts a little sign on her tricycle s handbasket reading Refuse To Grow Up it seems clear that she is trying to regain her lost childhood It would be patronizing to conclude that Mars is a total victim of her past and that she can do nothing now to assuage her problems Nevertheless the issue of why she remains a stripper is far more complex than many would care to admit The film s presentation of Mars childhood and her current position force a reexamination of the issue and caution against a casual dismissal of Mars as a willing victim And by doing so it carries the debate one step further The film is at its best however as it follows Martha from late pregnancy to the birth of her child The child s father is nowhere in sight and it is apparent that Martha will succeed or fail on the basis of her own efforts Martha is quite aware that patterns of abuse tend to repeat themselves and she worries about being a good mother One can only lament the early loss of childhood s innocence that leads Martha to say I feel a lot older than 19 But it is also quite touching and inspiring to see her rising above her dismal childhood to take charge of her own life GIRLTALK is not a well reasoned and provocative argument piece like the feminist documentaries RATE IT X and STILL KILLING US SOFTLY Rather than trying to dazzle the viewer with brilliant scholarship or rhetoric this film is more an introspective examination of the filmmakers efforts to work with the three girls The lessons to be learned stem from an evolving and intuitive experience rather than from critical or substantive analysis GIRLTALK manages to explore areas that have been given little attention in a manner that is not always successful but still effective in its own way Kate Davis was producer and editor of VACANT LOT a dramatic film about three Boston teenage boys Other films she has worked on include PARIS IS BURNING LOVE STORIES KATE and WACKO Alyson Denny wrote and directed SATURDAY AFTERNOON and BREAKFAST AT EIGHT She was also editor and animator for Ross McElwee s SHERMAN S MARCH Both Davis and Denny have taught filmmaking at Harvard University Richard Leacock founded the film department at MIT and he was a pioneer in the development of cinema verite during the 1960s His films include GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 1938 PRIMARY 1960 HAPPY MOTHER S DAY 1963 and DON T LOOK BACK 1967
0313,Stand and Deliver,1987,Cast Edward James Olmos Lou Diamond Phillips Rosana de Soto Vanessa Marquez Virginia Paris Carmen Argenziano Mark Eliot Will Gotay Patrick Baca Ingrid Oliu Tyde Kierney Bodie Olmos Karla Montana Daniel Villarreal Michael Goldfinger Michael Yama Lydia Nicole Graham Galloway James Victor Andy Garcia Rif Hutton Credits Director Ramon Menendez Producer Tom Musca Written by Ramon Menendez Tom Musca Executive Producer Lindsay Law Music by Craig Safan Editor Nancy Richardson Director of Photography Tom Richmond Associate Producer Iya Labunka Art Director Milo Costume Designer Kathryn Morrison Supervising Sound Editor Hamilton Sterling Project Consultant Kate Long The state of the American educational system has received much attention lately most of it negative STAND AND DELIVER in contrast is a film that tries to paint a positive picture of hope and inspiration The film brings to the screen the story of Jaime Escalante a high school teacher in East Los Angeles who managed to motivate and teach the intricacies of calculus to students who hardly knew remedial arithmetic When he first arrived at Garfield High he found gym instructors teaching basic math and the halls overrun by gangs and drug runners The situation was so bad that the predominantly Latino school was in danger of losing its accreditation But Escalante stayed and began to make a difference The film version has toned down the influence of the gangs eliminated the use of armed guards during the Advanced Placement re exam and created composite characters from real students But the film is otherwise quite faithful to the actual events Edward James Olmos Lt Castillo in MIAMI VICE who plays Escalante spent 18 hours a day for a month with the real Escalante to observe his teaching methods and personal habits See accompanying article for an interview with Olmos Olmos hard work pays off as he gives a rousing performance that carries the film past its weak first half Fortunately the film recovers its own feet before the end Americans love a success story and the first half goes overboard trying to oblige It introduces the characters and begins to show the unorthodox teaching methods of Escalante like bringing a machete to class This half of the film fails though to impart to the audience the magic that Escalante worked in his class because of choppy editing and faulty construction In depicting the positive influence Escalante began to exert the film glosses over how Escalante managed to calm the students down enough to listen to him in the first place The way the film presents it it seems that one day Escalante walked into chaos and by the next day had kids all lined up ready to learn It may have happened that way in real life but the film gives only glimpses into how Escalante achieved his remarkable successes For example one gifted young girl named Ana Vanessa Marquez tells Escalante that she has to leave school in the middle of the year because her father wants her to help in their family owned restaurant Escalante visits the father James Victor in his restaurant to try and convince him to let Ana stay in the class Far from succeeding however Escalante ends up arguing loudly with the father The father soon decides to throw Escalante and any hope for Ana s continued education out of the restaurant But lo and behold the next day there she is back in school ready to learn with no sign of what caused her father s remarkable change of heart Another botched change of heart takes place with hotheaded gang member named Angel Lou Diamond Phillips who has letters written on the outer side of his fingers that read F U C K Y O U when he brings his fists together Dennis Hopper s recent film COLORS was not very good but it did at least point out that one of the strongest reasons why youths join gangs is to feel a sense of belonging and identity That film also vividly showed how the gang ethic demands retribution against members of other gangs and those who leave or betray the gang These issues should be at the top of the list of any filmmaker who wants to show the success of a teacher in a gang ridden high school But these issues are barely mentioned by STAND AND DELIVER The scene where Angel walks away from his fellow gang members is simply that the film makes no attempt to examine why Angel would now accept the value of an education when it is clear that he rejected it in the past when he joined the gang Nor does the film delve into how Angel handles his ex gang friends once he left the gang The film introduces these concerns juggles them like a hot potato and then drops them without providing any illumination It seems as though the filmmakers did not want to discuss these matters at all but had to to address them at least slightly to maintain a modicum of credibility These examples are typical of how all the first half of the film does is present the end results of Escalante s efforts By not conveying any sense of how large the barriers the kids overcome really are the film fails to humanize the students and comes dangerously close to robbing their triumph of its meaning and value to others who may be facing the same situation As it stands Escalante and his students seem to be working virtual miracles and that leaves little room for the audience to identify or cheer for the characters since they will win out anyway For a film that wants to be inspirational this can be quite fatal Fortunately for the film the first half does succeed in setting the stage for the second half which is where the real value of this film lies The second part concerns the students efforts to prepare for and take the Advanced Placement calculus exam which no student had previously tried in the history of Garfield High The Educational Testing Service ETS which administers the tests discovers that a number of the students made the same mistake on the test and therefore opened an investigation into possible cheating Realizing that their scores will be voided is the biggest setback the kids suffer since they came under Escalante s spell and in addition to upsetting the high school seniors plans to attend college the accusations thoroughly demoralize Escalante and his students At this point the film finally begins to examine some of the deeper issues that so badly need to be brought to light In one tremendously evocative scene Escalante confronts the ETS investigators Andy Garcia and Rif Hutton who have been trying to convince the kids to confess how they cheated Working himself up Escalante points out that the kids made the same mistake because they all had the same teacher and he angrily adds that the kids scores would never have been questioned had the school been located in an upper class suburb and had the kids names been non Hispanic In another scene later on Escalante finds himself re examining the wisdom of his decisions to push the students to learn calculus as hard as he did These are the types of scenes that display the soul searching and human weaknesses that firmly ground the film s story in reality and carry the students eventual triumph to truly inspiring heights Throughout the film the camerawork does little to distinguish itself from the style of made for television films but the final shot of the film is well composed and deserves some mention Just prior to the shot Escalante is in the office of the Principal Molina Carmen Argenziano discussing whether the kids really cheated when a phone call brings news of the kids excellent scores on the re test As the dumbfounded principal reads out the grades in a voice over Escalante exits the office and walks down the hallway The camera shows the length of the hallway from the office to the doorway at the far end As Escalante nears the doorway he silently permits himself a hand raised cheer Then silhouetted by the light from the doorway and his back still turned to the audience he keeps on walking down the hallway and out the door which shuts behind him After a few more shots the credits begin to roll The reason the shot works so well is the stoic way in which Olmos conveys Escalante s acceptance of the final payoff of all his efforts Instead of patting himself on the back Olmos lets the audience cheer for Escalante Olmos also recognizes that the film s ending is the beginning of Escalante s efforts and Olmos plays the scene accordingly The way Olmos walks down the hall through the doorway one feels that Escalante is going back to his classroom to teach some more students The camerawork also does not overly hype the triumph The filmmakers could easily have shifted the point of view to a front view of Olmos and then ended the film on a freeze frame of Olmos upraised hand They wisely chose not to do so The result of how they did compose the shot is that the ending is easily the best moment in the film One of Escalante s innovations was to display posters of Einstein and Galileo in his classroom next to popular sports figures like Kareem Abdul Jabbar Escalante knew that if he could get his students to respect the great thinkers as much as they admired rock stars and movie actors his battle was half won The filmmakers show the posters only in the background but they too know that the real importance of Escalante s story lies in changing viewers attitudes enough to cheer for a schoolteacher who cares and beats the odds The filmmakers manage to bring the story to the screen although clumsily and that in of itself is remarkable and refreshing in the final analysis The filmmakers of STAND AND DELIVER are mainly recent graduates from film schools making their feature film debut Director Ramon Menendez emigrated to the United States from Cuba in the early 1960s when he was still a child He enrolled in the UCLA film school in 1976 where he met Tom Musca producer and co writer and Tom Richmond cinematographer Editor Nancy Richardson also attended the UCLA film school
0315,Milagro Beanfield War The,1988,While watching the opening credits roll on this film I said to myself Wow this is really hokey but the clearly superior cinematography and the music while inappropriately European or Argentinian sounding kept my hopes up and I was rewarded with a charming cartoon not the animated variety but the kind William Goldman talks about in his book ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE Warner Books Inc New York NY 1983 In it there is a short chapter called The Ecology of Hollywood p 151 Therein he talks about comic book movies THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR is a comic book movie par excellance Being as the movie is recently released I won t divulge much about the story but I would like to urge that if you like fairy tales and or cartoons you simply can t miss this movie At the outset let me assure you that I am a bonafide hispanophile I m married to a woman from Colombia who is the greatest thing God ever did for me I speak Spanish which was a definite aid in enjoying this movie love the food some of the music the cultures So how can you expect an unbiased review Well I know something about movies having written screenplays Let me start there The movie like so many others is based on a novel No I haven t read the novel but there is no need to A screenplay has to stand on its own two feet even if it s an adaptation from another medium perhaps more so when it is The differences between a good novel and a good screenplay are too numerous and far ranging to go into here I bring this up however because so many adaptations fall flat because of it but also because the movie s title mislead me I thought I was in for some good drama but found I was fed pablum This bothered me To be sure some great movies have been made with Hispanic characters and cultural values Brando was involved in some great ones THE APPALOOSA actor 1966 and the colossal ONE EYED JACKS actor director 1961 after which Brando for having spent so much money directing it was unable to work as a director Another less well known and surrealistic film is THE MOLE shot in Mexico I suspect only the real cine addicts amongst us may have see it I also refer you to THE NEST EL NIDO Spanish 1980 as another great one This is not meant as a pitch for Spanish films but merely to provide a comparison between the difference figuratively and cinematically between sinking your teeth into a steak and being fed pablum One of the refreshing things about this movie is that there are no big stars in it There are actresses and actors that you ve seen before but no one you d recognize as big Sonia Braga Brazilian has a part in it Maybe you ll recognize her I ve never been quite able to understand just exactly why unknowns are not used more Some of the great Italians used them extensively See eg DeSica s UMBERTO D 1952 or the touching American film DAVID AND LISA 1963 whose biggest star at the time was Howard Da Silva who while admittedly a great actor did not have tremendous name recognition There s money to be made with unknowns but who in Hollywood these days will risk it I ll go with Stallone where are the keys to my Porsche thank you While not meaning to lessen any of the good to great supporting actors in this movie and there is a great performance turned in by the Mexican character actor Carlos Riquelme who plays a character called Amarante the part heart stealer for me was the pig cast as Amarante s pet You ve simply got to see him her You ll laugh with this movie and the characters will make you love them When it s done you may feel like you ve been to a carnival my wife and I made tacos and drank beer after watching it but it may also make you feel like you ve just eaten cotton candy You ll feel good while you re eating it but afterwards you won t feel like you ve had anything substancial Don t let that put you off This is good entertainment and although a formula tale of rich land developers vs indigent but spiritually rich folk it is lots of fun The issues this film raises need to be raised again and again The simplistic political message at the end of the film certainly has widespread belief if only the real world worked that way It kind of proves you can t answer serious problems with simple minded ideas from the elite Look for small chinks in the cult of machismo in this movie too Directed by Robert Redford
0316,Kamigami no Fukaki Yokubo,1968,Cast Rentaro Mikuni Choichiro Kawarazaki Kazuo Kitamura Kazuko Okiyama Yasuko Matsui Yoshi Kato Hosei Komatsu Kanjuro Arashi Chikako Hosokawa Chikage Ogi Jun Hamamura Credits Directed by Shohei Imamura Screenplay by Shohei Imamura and Keiji Hasebe Adapted from the 1962 play PARAJI Cinematography by Masao Tochizawa Music by Toshiro Mayuzumi Art Direction by Takeshi Omura Shohei Imamura has always liked making messy really human Japanese unsettling films And he has done exactly that in KAMIGAMI NO FUKAKI YOKUBO THE PROFOUND DESIRE OF THE GODS a film he made in 1968 that had to wait two decades to be released in its full 170 minute version in the United States Using vivid color and and magnificent cinemascope photography Imamura reaches back to ancient myths to explore the incestual origins of human society in the tiny island paradise of Kuragejima in the Ryukyu Islands Imamura coalesces all aspects of the film into a coherent whole with a supreme confidence that permeates virtually every shot of his film Not until the short epilogue at the end does this rare sort of masterful filmmaking go slightly astray The film is defined by its six main characters who form a microcosm of both the island s past and its encroaching future Four of them are members of the Futori family which has a long history of engaging in taboo practices like incest and being punished by both the gods and their fellow island residents Because of this they are commonly considered little more than animals by the other islanders and they are treated accordingly Twenty years ago Nekichi Futori Rentaro Mikuni was discovered having an incestuous relationship with his sister Uma Yasuko Matsui According to legend the gods showed their displeasure by hurling a huge boulder onto the island during a terrible storm The islanders then chained Nekichi for his crimes and put Uma in the care of the local noros shamanesses To appease the wrath of the gods Nekichi has been digging a pit for the boulder to fall into for the past twenty years and the job is nearing completion Nekichi s son Kametaro Futori Choichiro Kawarazaki is understandably confused about his heritage since Nekichi is the son of his own grandfather Kametaro is also uncertain about his future career plans Kametaro s sister Toriko Kazuko Okiyama is mentally retarded and is quite content to wander around in a burlap sack and to be used sexually by island men The other two main characters in the film are the village headman Ryugen Ryu Yoshi Kato who manages a sugar mill on the island and Mr Kariya an engineer from Tokyo who is sent by his company to construct a water source for the mill Kariya is of course the representative of civilization and he finds the local traditions and myths that obstruct his task to be incomprehensible As may be expected from this culture clash Imamura draws a few comedic moments with Kariya Also in the film is grouchy Grandpa Futori Kanjuro Arashi who eventually dies and returns from the grave in a night time vision seen by many of the islanders Finally Tokuri the Balladeer Jun Hamamura imparts the film with much of its mythic proportions through his storytelling and songs For most of the film Imamura calmly and casually explores the idiosyncratic world of the Futoris and their life on Kuragejima with an almost documentary like style But all throughout the film is an ongoing subtext that ultimately relates back to the film s title Furthermore that subtext is the heart of the film and is crucially dependent on Imamura s camerawork Typical of how Imamura constructs his shots is one scene where Kariya Ryugen and Kametaro who has become the engineer s helper inspect a cliff for sources of water Most of the scene is shot matter of factly from ground or eye level However as the three begin to inspect a hole already dug in the rock Imamura abruptly shifts the camera angle to an overhead shot On one edge of the cinemascope frame is Kametaro and on the other edge are Ryugen and Kariya Because the sudden cut is deliberate and repeated throughout the film the scene strongly implies that the three men are being watched by hidden unseen forces And because the camera photographs the three men precisely on the edges of the frame it seems as though the hidden forces are watching them through a perfectly situated window that leads from one world to another The question of who or what these hidden forces are the key to the subtext is answered by numerous stylized shots of owls lizards birds snakes and other animals These shots are by the way good examples Imamura s fascination with hybridizing documentary and dramatic styles He first explored documentary authenticity in his 1963 film NIPPON KNOCHUKI THE INSECT WOMAN The common factor linking most of the animal shots is that Imamura repeatedly focuses on the animals piercing eyes That and the fact that Imamura includes them in the film at all transforms the creatures into physical extensions of an omnipresent divinity constantly observing the island from all directions This is especially apparent when an owl with bright yellow eyes gazes steadily at the characters as they bumble around in a forest late at night The cinematic link between nature and divinity is the underlying structure that the entire film is based on and indeed it is the key to beauty of how Imamura documents the vagaries of human interaction and the worlds in which they live the issue with which Imamura is ultimately most concerned One should note that Imamura s camerawork both raises the sense of watching through a window and also conveys a sense of the animals actually legendary gods through the film s identification of divinity with nature as the ones doing the watching What the film s title content and structure emphatically exclude is the possibility of equating the film s gods with the film s audience It would be smug and arrogant to assume that the film s viewers are meant to be gods Because Imamura s camera often switches focus from the human characters to the animals and back again it is clear that the camera s field of view does not singlemindedly represent any one particular perspective And even if it were Imamura s intention to make viewers into gods so to speak the viewer gods would be necessarily impotent and ineffective since the viewer is at the mercy of Imamura s cinematic and narrative judgment To the other hand one could conclude that the film is little more than an indulgent effort to equate the real god back to Imamura himself While Imamura has played similar tricks in his other films most notably in his 1967 film NINGEN JOHATSU A MAN VANISHES where Imamura surreptitiously photographed a woman who is searching for her missing fiance and who falls in love with the fake interviewer investigator Imamura paid to accompany her there is no such sense of egotism in KAMIGAMI NO FUKAKI YOKUBO because Imamura never calls undue attention to his camera tricks He also does not carry anything to gratuitous extremes Imamura is certainly fascinated by the dirty laundry of humankind and it is therefore only natural that he would be attracted to the themes of incest and lecherous gods that Kuragejima has to offer But in this film at least Imamura wants to examine and learn from those themes not exploit or revel in them The abrupt epilogue of the film somewhat disrupts the flow of the film but it does effectively address how these concerns have changed the community five years after the main events of the film Kariya the engineer returns with his family to visit as does Kametaro who has become disillusioned with life in Tokyo Although western influences have transformed the island Coca Cola signs are everywhere new indigenous legends are also emerging Imamura implies that such folklore will always find resources to survive in the face of encroaching realities What is most striking though is how strange and foreign the visitors seem on the island Not having witnessed the events that led to the creation of the new myths the visitors will never consider the rock named after the now deceased Toriko to be anything more than a curiosity Kametaro is best qualified among the visitors to realize the full import of the changes and it is therefore appropriate that he is the only one who sees a vision of Toriko dancing on the train tracks ahead of the locomotive pulling Kariya s train This is a rather clumsy method but Imamura makes his point Kametaro and the audience are well on their way to realizing that the story of Toriko has now become intimately anchored within the village s traditions and collective mythology just as a large rock hurled onto the island became a part of the local lore twenty years earlier Imamura is in this film concerned with the symbiotic relationship among individual humans in a primitive society as well as the dynamic tensions between civilization and mythology He has managed to explore the relatively isolated world of Kuragejima with both his and the residents integrity intact Not once does Imamura patronize the villagers And his filmmaking is near the height of perfection Imamura s documentary style footage is in fact decidely manipulative but it is also disarmingly laidback and easygoing enough that that neither the narrative impact nor the cinematic illusion except during the epilogue is ever lost KAMIGAMI NO FUKAKI YOKUBO is another of Imamura s excellent films one that has endured two decades of obscurity in this country The full length version will undoubtedly transform that situation for the better English title in brackets FD Feature Documentary Shohei Imamura was born in patrician circles but he quickly rebelled against his upbringing After a stint in theater at Waseda University he first joined the Shochiku company s Ofuna Studios working as an assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu and others However he longed to leave the studio because it and Ozu embodied a view toward tradition and family that Imamura emphatically rejected He joined the Nikkatsu studio which was revived in the mid 1950s In 1975 Imamura declared I wouldn t just say I wasn t influenced by Ozu I would say I didn t want to be influenced by him The running times of these films may not reflect the film s original length According to Audie Bock of East West Classics Japanese distributors routinely cut films to approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes when shipping them to the United States
0317,Dolls,1986,For those of you who don t know DOLLS is another little sickie from the same folks who brought us REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND Unbelievable horror generously laced with gore and a truly perverse sense of humor is their trademark and they live up nicely to their reputation with this little gem The story is familiar A bunch of assorted characters get stuck on a winding country road in the middle of a sudden storm and stop to spend the night at the lavish home of a kindly but somewhat strange old couple Of course they have to spend the night and are soon introduced to the handiwork of their hosts Toys dolls hundreds of them These of course are not your regular Mattel issue Wetsy Betsy s but a truly fun loving breed of little playthings that just want to have some fun And some fun they have Nothing unusual so far right Basic horror formula with some NIGHT GALLERY and TWILIGHT ZONE thrown in Rod where are you when we need you So what makes this movie memorable The casting it s damn near perfect Don t expect the usual Empire crowd No Jeffrey Combs no Barbara Crampton no Barbara Crampton s breasts no big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent There s one vet though but a great ensemble cast with just the right blend of camp and seriousness I love a movie where you can hear the people around you saying No don t go in there you fool Don t you know what s behind that door and this is definitely one of them Another difference between this flick and the other two is that the psycho sexual aspect is really toned down It s also not quite as bloody but probably even more frightening Do not show this movie to your children unless you want to spend at least a few nights awake with them warding off the Bad dollies I was keeping a close eye on my sister s teddy bear for about a week myself
0318,Fruits de la passion Les,1981,After complaining for months that it s impossible to find Shuji Terayama s films on video by chance a friend spotted Klaus Kinski on the box of FLOWERS OF PASSION and called my attention to it If anyone has information on the availability of Terayama s other films I would love to hear from him FLOWERS OF PASSION is based on a story by Pauline Reage who wrote THE STORY OF O It is set in a mythical Robbe Grillet esque Hong Kong in the 1920 s In fact the atmosphere and imagery in FLOWERS OF PASSION is very similar to some of Robbe Grillet s later novels for example LA MAISON DE RENDEZVOUS with its surreal events dream like images and themes of mental and sexual bondage FLOWERS OF PASSION is appropriately produced by the producer for Oshima s Bataille esque IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES and Peter the female impersonator who appears in many Kurosawa films plays the madam of a brothel FLOWERS OF PASSION is beautifully photographed and has many unforgettable images the elaborate toys in the brothel O tied to a bed perching precariously on a sloping roof with a bird on her torso a prostitute drowns herself in a river and a piano floats up from the bottom of the river to prop up her body There are many well constructed scenes and lighting effects However Terayama seems to have little to say beyond the cliches of French decadent sexual philosophy think of Bataille or de Sade the film opens with a Baudelaire quote He comes very close to capturing the atmosphere of books like Robbe Grillet s LA MAISON DE RENDEZVOUS but without explicitly challenging the preconceptions of viewer
0319,Big,1988,Every once in a while the Law of Averages works especially well or poorly for filmmakers Columbia made MAROONED just before Apollo 13 and THE CHINA SYNDROME just before Three Mile Island On the other hand three different filmmakers independently decided to make the films PLACES IN THE HEART COUNTRY and THE RIVER a few seasons back all save the farm films Of late it has been child and adult changing places films In little more than a year we have seen LIKE FATHER LIKE SON VICE VERSA and 18 AGAIN Now Tom Hanks joins the ranks of Dudley Moore Judge Reinhold and George Burns playing a younger person in an older person s body Well the first major difference is that this is not two people changing places The story is not really two stories of people adapting to sudden age change Instead we have a 13 year old suddenly finding himself about twice that age Josh Baldwin finds a mysterious wish granting machine at a carnival After this point the story gets more realistic and at the same time less so Josh s own mother thinks the older version of him played by Tom Hanks is a kidnapper and he has to flee with the help of a friend to Manhattan He is a child who for the first time is seeing the gritty real world without the protection of his parents Then the realism dissolves as he enters the business world and finds his winning boyish ways open doors for him Previous versions of the idea have children in older bodies trying to seem normal and failing miserably or at least humorously Hanks wears silly looking clothing and acts like a kid and in some sort of film blanc manner it all works out for him as if he was Chauncey Gardner from BEING THERE His secret boyhood catapults him to success in business and love in the toy business None of this is very believable And on top of that the ball of string that I collected as a boy may have had more loose ends than BIG but I doubt it Supporting Hanks is Elizabeth Perkins who played a second banana role in ABOUT LAST NIGHT As the woman intrigued by the boyish Hanks she reminds one at times of Debra Winger and at other times of Jill Clayburgh Also on hand are the venerable Robert Loggia whose second career in film seems more successful than his first and John Heard who tarnishes some of his earlier nice guy roles playing an ambitious executive And who can forget the grungy hotel clerk played by Rockets Redglare And the whole production is directed by Penny Marshall formerly of LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY I would say BIG is a step up from her first film JUMPIN JACK FLASH but it still gets just a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0320,Aria,1987,Book publishing has the concept of the original anthology Several well known authors are given a theme to write on and each does a short story bringing an original approach to that theme Occasionally a similar approach is tried in anthology films having a different director for each segment but usually what is done seems to be to give the director a script and let him direct it Films like QUARTET TRIO ENCORE all based on collections of W Somerset Maugham stories O HENRY S FULL HOUSE and DEAD OF NIGHT were probably done this way ARIA appears to be a film that gave its directors even more autonomy In this anthology film the only thing that the segments have in common is that each is an interpretation of an operatic aria As long as the aria is played through the film it seems to fulfill the requirements It would be misleading to try to rate such a mixed bag of short films as a single piece Instead I will consider each segment Even there I want to give each piece two ratings one on how it stands on its own as a film and a second rating on how well it used the music it was interpreting Ratings are on the 4 to 4 scale Opera UN BALLO IN MASCHERA A MASKED BALL by Giuseppe Verdi Director Nicholas Roeg The opening piece but for a framing piece that will be described later involves an assassination attempt on King Zog of Albania The attractive and versatile Teresa Russell BLACK WIDOW has finally been given a role that she is totally unconvincing in Sporting a handlebar mustache and wearing a tight military tunic she plays King Zog Only afterwards did I find out that it was she in the role but it was obviously an actress rather than an actor Nor did the punchline of the story work Story 0 Appropriateness 1 Opera LA FORZA DEL DESTINO THE FORCE OF DESTINY by Giuseppe Verdi Director Charles Sturridge I did not care for this segment on first brush but on discussing it later I see more quality in it Sturridge shows us troubled children leading a pointless existence of TV watching and getting into trouble The original aria is a plea to the Virgin Mary which may well be appropriate Story 1 Appropriateness 1 Two attractive female attendants in a gym for body builders first desire the powerful masculine bodies around them then try to seduce them only to be frustrated and ignored by the dehumanized athletes around them The section is amusing and perhaps even erotic Story 1 Appropriateness 1 Seemingly out of place we have one Blake Edwards style sex farce A husband and wife cheating on each other both go with their lovers to the same garish motel The common tension builds as husband and wife nearly run into each other time and again Will they run into each other Do we really care Mindless but amusing Story 1 Appropriateness 0 Opera DIE TOTE STADT THE DEAD CITY by Erick Korngold Director Bruce Beresford Because I read the program I know what the director of BREAKER MORANT and CRIMES OF THE HEART was trying to say with this film but it does not come from the film According to the program it has a man falling in love with what he believes to be the spirit of his dead wife It appears to be just two lovers and scenes of an atmospheric and apparently empty old European city Story 0 Appropriateness 1 One would expect a good segment from a director as distinguished as Robert Altman Surprise This is the biggest loser in the lot It is dull but worse than that it is borrowed from a much better film MARAT SADE Both films deal with the historical fact that in post Revolutionary France it was though chic to involve the inmates of insane asylums in theatrical productions In MARAT SADE the insane put on a play and rich patrons come to see it in Altman s the insane come to see an opera In both the mad are uncontrollable which is one reason the rich want to watch them But in MARAT SADE the monkeyshines are only a tiny piece of all that is going on on the screen They are all that happens in Altman s section of ARIA Story 1 Appropriateness 1 I was not fond of Roddam s films THE BRIDE and QUADROPHENIA but I have to give him the prize for ARIA This had to be what the people who thought of the film had in mind This is a very sensual adaptation of Wagner s Liebestod that in some ways fits the music as well or better than Wagner did originally Story 1 Appropriateness 3 I lucked out on this one I did not read the program There is a nice surprise in this segment but the program ruins it by telling too much The story is of a princess of some sort being decorated by having diamonds and rubies inlaid directly into her flesh But even as we watch it more is going on than we realize Don t read the program Story 1 Appropriateness 1 An old woman dressed incongruously in the clothes of a much younger person remembers days gone by This one squeaks by passable but no great shakes Story 0 Appropriateness 0 If Bryden was trying to say something with his framing sequence of John Hurt preparing for and singing PAGLIACCI it went right past me Not very unusual This was not up to most of the segments it framed Story 1 Appropriateness 1
0323,Bull Durham,1988,BULL DURHAM is a kind of comedy we don t see much of any more There are a lot of comedies being made now but most seem to be of a formula Take one or more comics established by being on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SECOND CITY etc and add a script full of jokes you would have to be blind AND deaf to miss by definition subtlety means someone might miss a gag The comedies you get then are films like the horribly unfunny SPIES LIKE US DRAGNET and DR DETROIT BULL DURHAM is more like the comedies they made most of the time in the 1940s and 1950s What humor it has is derived from the interaction of believable personalities in believable situations The only thing keeping BULL DURHAM from being a throwback to the subtler comedies of the 1940s is several fairly explicit sex scenes BULL DURHAM tells the story of one season in the life of a minor league ball team the Durham Bulls The team has among others a pitcher Nuke Laloosh played by Tim Robbins who has a hundred horsepower pitching arm and a nine volt brain a catcher Crash Davis well played by Kevin Costner and two groupies One groupie is the owner s daughter played by Jenny Robertson and the other Annie Savoy played by Susan Sarandon is an odd fan who has turned baseball into a sort of religion and has sort of become a team institution Crash has been hired not just to catch but also to keep Nuke out of trouble as the big dumb super pitcher is groomed for the majors His job is complicated by the attentions of Ms Savoy who is indecisive whether it is the pitcher or the catcher she wants to sleep with BULL DURHAM gives us some tantalizing views of the characters of the team members and especially the managers but unfortunately these characters are never filled out Most of the story deals with Sarandon s character who for someone with no more status with the team than fan is never far from the action Some of the action she generates herself by tying ball players to beds and reading to them poetry by Blake and Whitman And though Costner s character is a bit stereotypical the embittered veteran player he plays the role well With a rating of 1 on the 4 to 4 scale it brings to four the number of sports films I have liked THE NATURAL got a 3 from me and IT HAPPENS EVERY SPRING and HOOSIERS got 1s
0324,Rambo III,1988,Synopsis In general an OK movie Unfortunately there was a lot of unneeded character development plot and far too many peaceful settings to make the movie really enjoyable It stars Rocky Balboa as our hero John Rambo along with a cast of thousands of expendable extras with bad teeth I was going to skip this latest version of Gee Don t I Have A Great Body until I read in the paper that some watchdog group reported something like 127 people got killed in the movie Now being a math major I quickly figured this gave it a 1 5 pkm people killed per minute rating As this beat hell out of the Friday the 13th movies I mugged 8 winos and went down to the local theatre I should have rolled a few old ladies too prices went up and I couldn t afford popcorn The first scene is just some stupid old guy in an army uniform down in the docks of some Third World country showing Johnny s picture to a bunch of natives More interesting was the normal film preamble telling us who stars in it directed it and produced it In general this scene was much too long I d replace it with a black background with Brought to you by the usual gang of idiots in white letters We get to see Johnny in the flesh in the next scene There s gonna be a stick fight and lots of ugly extras are betting on the outcome Although the fight starts out with Johnny losing we in the audience know better Let s face it John s got soulful brown eyes while his opponent only has a scraggly beard I m not going to spoil the movie for you by telling you who wins let s just say it was a surprise ending While no blood was shown and nobody dies there are a few good kicks thrown and punches landed Let s let the scene stand Cut now to Johnny working on some big primitive building The old fart in the army uniform shows up along with a CIA flunky They get re acquainted with each other say lots of sweet nothings to each other and then the old guy asks John to go into Afghanistan John says no Old fart says you ll regret this you know and leaves Dull dull dull This 5 minute scene would have been much better had the old fart walked up asked John to enter Afghanistan and John told him where to go 10 maybe 15 seconds max is all that was required I must admit at this point I was getting pretty pissed off I mean it s been 15 minutes already and not a single body Maybe that watchdog group was watching the evening news instead of the movie Even worse I d had my eye on this little old lady 2 rows down who was eating popcorn About the time I decided to mug her she got up and left It s a good thing I didn t follow the old bat into the lobby cause right about here the movie gets interesting This nifty Russian copter comes across the old fart and his caravan in the desert Boy them Rooskies really know how to make an airplane This thing had rockets machine guns bombs missles and a big old searchlight mounted on the front so the audience can see the bullets go right through the bodies Much better than an American psycho in a hockey mask with a butcher knife or rope In the excitement I lost count but at least 10 guys must have gotten shot and or blown up here No question about it this scene remains untouched Maybe I spoke too soon The movie loses track of its objective for fifteen to twenty minutes here We have the CIA guy getting John to go into Afghanistan to kill some Commies we have Johnny getting his weapons we have Johnny going into the desert to meet up with the rebels we have arguments we have a stupid kid whom we know damn well ain t gonna get blown up so why have him at all we have a big meeting where John impresses the rebels and we have some stupid game on horseback where they try to throw a lamb into a circle They shoulda just given John a gun some C4 and tossed him into the desert Oops I almost forgot There was one terrifying scene I shoulda mentioned in the last paragraph John and his guide are riding horses down a steep path and the horses slip I was so scared the horse would break it s leg I bit my lip hard enough to draw blood Jesus Christ They shouldn t be allowed to show stuff like that to young kids it might warp them for life When is the movie industry ever going to police itself Or are we going to have to do it ourselves Oh maybe I should also mention the torture scene here too Seems the evil Russian boss tortures the old fart By the way the old fart was taken captive instead of being killed 2 paragraphs ago Anyway it wasn t much of a torture scene Dr Craig treated Erlich much worse while sticking the plastic heart into that sheep Anywhoo finally we get to see 2 more of these magnificent Rooskie choppers God I orgasm every time I see one of this machines It only takes two to wipe out an entire rebel village including women and children What more could you ask for From here on out things pick up quickly Lets face it there s only half an hour left and they still have 80 to 90 Commies to kill Assuming our watchdogs didn t lie to us There are some really neat scenes here My favorite was when Johnny tied a rope around a Commie s neck pulled the pin on a grenade that was on the Russkies jacket then threw the Russkie into a deep hole that just happened to be handy Brother you haven t lived until you ve seen a guy fall 20 feet jerk to a stop 20 feet above the ground and then a split second later get blown into smithereens Totally awesome dude Well this review is getting to be much too long Besides I hear my boss coming down the aisle so I gotta go back to work But I d like to briefly comment on what I would do to make the movie better First off there was way too much plot here I mean who cares why the guy is getting killed as long as he has a spectacular death Right So let s do away with the first hour or so of the movie Except for the scene where we are first introduced to the helicopters maybe the opening credits can scroll up while the chopper does its thing to the caravan Nah that would obstruct the audience s view of the blood Let s just have the chopper fly towards the caravan so the audience can know what s gonna happen as soon as we find out who produced the damn movie Next it must have been a real bitch to count the bodies in this movie Sometimes five or ten bought it at the same time and no matter how loud we yelled the projectionist refused to rewind the film and show the good parts in slow motion So I propose we just get say 150 people in a line They can have big numbers across their chests kinda like in a marathon so the audience can identify with them Then the hero kills each one in a unique way Stab a few strangle a couple blow one up burn one blow up several etc This would have several advantages First it makes the watchdogs jobs much easier Right off the bat they can see how many people die just by reading the number of the guy standing at the far right Then they can just leave and go back to spinning Ozzy Osbourne records backwards Second the producers can do away with the local scenery and just line the suckers up in the desert Face it who wants to see a bunch of trees and flowers The money saved here can be used to buy more bullets bombs and blood Finally the two methods described above could result in shortening the movie to about half an hour or so So they can show it to 3 times as many people This will greatly increase their profits at no loss in quality to the movie going public PS Anybody know where I can rent one of those Russian helicopters I d love to try one out
0325,Vaivegli but jaunam?,1987,IS IT EASY TO BE YOUNG is a documentary on Latvian youth made in the mid 1980s Unfortunately the entire film is horribly dubbed with one droning narrator handling all the voices The documentary is in several independent sections spliced together with little thought for organization or transition The first and longest section contains numerous clips from an open air rock concert somewhere in Latvia Most of the footage is of the largely youthful audience who could easily be a group of middle American suburban teenagers with colorful T shirts and jackets some sporting funky sunglasses There was a near riot after the concert Teenagers trashed the interior of a train and seven or eight of them were arrested as scapegoats There is extensive footage of the trial with some hilarious shots of jurors looking very bored interleaved with interviews with some of the teenagers involved in the trial Some of the other sections featured a young man who worked in a morgue with a one second shot of an autopsy a group of Latvian punks complete with studded leather jackets and painted hair the most anti social thing they re shown doing is spraying graffiti on an old building youths helping to renovate an old building and a film maker in his late 20s or early 30s The last section was surprisingly on the war in Afghanistan The narrative had understandably few political undertones focusing instead on two veterans and their impressions of the war We are shown clips from a film made by the young director interviewed earlier The visual style imagery and treatments are remarkably similar to music videos on MTV there is no dialog only an electronic soundtrack the same heavy handed delivery overblown fantasy images and lighting effects that you d expect to see from say a video by Kansas Maybe this has something to do with video pioneer Rybczinski who made several interesting films in Poland before moving to the US and making MTV videos for Art of Noise and Yoko Ono Overall the youths interviewed in the documentary seemed to feel that they have all they need and there is nothing left to work for Most of all they seem terminally bored In other words they are not much different from suburban teenagers in the US It s amazing how two societies that profess to be so different have produced generations that are so alike in their materialism and apathy
0326,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1988,Wednesday evening I stood in line at the newly restored Alhambra Theatre in San Francisco Here s a trend I hope catches on the theatre used to be split in two but now it s back to being one large room the way theatres are supposed to be I was at the head of a long line a very long line Opening night audiences are the best in the world especially when the movie is An Event And what an event it turned out to be WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT always sans question mark is a landmark film Technically it is as big a breakthrough as STAR WARS and there are precious few movies I ve enjoyed as much as this one Now I like to think of myself as reasonably well up on the state of the art in visual effects and to a respectable degree in the state of the art in animation Roger proved to me that I don t know nuthin The animation as John Lasseter pointed out is the kind of animation animators dream of doing this is real animator s animation In nearly every shot they go out of their way to show off Most of it is so flawless that animation neophytes will never guess how hard it was to do But they will enjoy it just the same How could you not enjoy a piano duet with Donald and Daffy Duck How could you not enjoy seeing nearly every great animated character ever created working together in one film I could tell you more about characters which get applause for just showing up but I m bound and determined not to put any spoilers in this review Industrial Light and Magic especially the optical department deserves a zillion simoleans and a basket of joy buzzers for their work on this film I particularly hope that Ed Jones gets a little statue for the tone mattes used to give the animated characters so much dimensionality The optical crew composited 1 050 shots as compared with just over 600 for RETURN OF THE JEDI Bear in mind that they pulled this off simultaneously with doing WILLOW Those guys are superhuman suicidal or both Do not I repeat do not show up late for this film If it starts while you are at the candy counter forget the imitation popcorn and bits of sticky chewy stuff and run into the theatre The first several minutes contain some of the best and hardest animation ever done While the animation is pedal to the metal during the whole movie one standout sequence is also the most subdued Jessica Rabbit Roger s wife delivers a knock out torch song at the Ink and Paint club in a sequence which is a cinematic tour de force Amy Irving did the vocal performance for the scene and I didn t know she could sing As if the animation weren t enough reason to go see the movie and don t you think it ought to be Robert Back to the Future Zemekis serves up his finest work ever The same layered detailed approach he took to the world of 1955 is applied to 1947 For example there are no cartoon characters in the movie predating that year except for the penguins from MARY POPPINS but they re working as waiters The best part of his direction for me is his sense of kinetics The timing the pace the movement of everything is darn near perfect from the way scenes are cut to the way props move Bob Hoskins is absolutely dead on as the drunk has been private eye Eddie Valiant who is caught up in a murder mystery His ability to act with characters that aren t there yet is stunning This is effects acting at its finest If he isn t remembered at Oscar time then the Academy is a bigger bunch of maroons than even I thought The supporting cast almost half of which is human is also very good Christopher Lloyd is wonderfully evil as the dread Judge Doom Joanna Cassidy as Valiant s lady friend holds her own even though she can be seen at least once biting her lip to keep from laughing Don t you try that or you ll need stitches in your lip Listen Log out now and head for the theatre Expect long lines Word of mouth on this film is going to be incredible See it in a theatre with a big audience it s a terrific audience participation film Of course there is so much going on and the laughter is so frequent that you ll have to go see it again and again to catch what you missed the first time
0327,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1988,Mini review WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT deals with an animated i e cartoon rabbit accused of murdering a human being He is aided by an alcoholic private eye to clear his name Robert Zemickis and Stephen Spielberg give us a standard but irresistible story and characters I give this a must see A 3 and a 95 To paraphrase from HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE Sneakin in at the Movies This was a great movie It was filled with stereotypes but I give it the serious high five If you have ever enjoyed the Roadrunner Tom and Jerry Sylvester and Tweety or any other slapstick chase cartoons then you will love ROGER RABBIT If you have ever enjoyed Goofy Bugs Bunny Droopy or any other hidden adult meanings but fun for kids cartoons then you will love ROGER RABBIT If you enjoyed the Star Trek episodes dealing with the 1930 s and 1940 s e g A Piece of the Action or the Christopher Lloyd characters in BUCKAROO BANZAI BACK TO THE FUTURE and Star Trek III The Search for Spock then you will love ROGER RABBIT I should give a little background before the movie Boston was definitely Dark and Stormy but it caught me by surprise and put me in the mood for cartoon humor with the high winds the driving rain from out of nowhere and the lightening which seemed to be chasing me as I ran to the theatre Anyone who has seen Bugs Bunny run from Elmer Fudd could relate Especially the episode where he uses the Spear and Magic Helmet to bring down our hero This is a great work of art totally separate from the quality of the story The Toons move through the story just as realistically as the humans a compliment to the artists who do this in much better quality than seen in any cartoons since the time of the 1950 s and Chuck Jones The actors have it much easier They only have to act in front of the camera with no cues or references Jimmy Stewart had to do this and many people have seen people play off of invisible actors in BEWITCHED and I DREAM OF JEANNIE but these Toon Human interactions are perfectly done right down to the Toon s effects on human clothing and bodies The premise behind the movie is simple Toons are alive and well and living in Toontown but work in Hollywood Los Angeles with humans Roger Rabbit is a recurrent victim of Baby Herman in their films but has had trouble doing his part lately Bob Hoskins MONA LISA is Private Eye Eddie Valient known for doing Toons a good turn until And Christopher Lloyd is Judge Doom the magistrate of Toontown meant to keep them Toons in their place The supporting cast is just about anyone from Disney and Warner Brothers that you would remember and in a version of detente they all work together in this film You have just to name a few Plenty of others will be easy to spot plus the references to many more not seen in the film This is the kind of film that you would buy instead of rent as a VCR tape because each time you watch it you will see neat little details that you missed the first time You might even want to buy a few of the old cartoons before going just to get even more in the mood for the camp fun nostalgia and quality animation The last time I felt this from a film was in BATMAN THE MOVIE And never have I heard the amount of applause after the movie was over Definitely the best out so far this summer My first movie review is now concluded and I leave you with one of many quotes that will stay with you a while There are plenty more visual jokes that cannot be described can only be seen Aaron Fager Boston University and The University of Miami
0328,Silence at Bethany The,1988,Actually it s been about a month since the Seattle International Film Festival ended I ve been busy with other matters and haven t gotten a chance to get the rest of the Film Festival reviews out Hopefully I ll have the rest written by July 4th moriarty There are things to look for in the SIFF schedules One of the better signs at least for me has been that the film is an American Playhouse Theatrical Release i e sponsored by the PBS television program of the same name These are released in theaters first then on TV the one that comes to mind is A FLASH OF GREEN They are almost always understated intelligent dramas that involve one intellectually as well as emotionally SILENCE AT BETHANY is no exception The film takes place in a Pennsylvania Mennonite community during the early 1940s A young man named Ira Martin Mark Moses who grew up in the community but left to live with relatives out of state when his parents died in a fire returns to visit The simple non materialistic lifestyle appeals to him as does the local deacon s niece Wilder In turn the deacon sees Ira s spiritual knowledge and enthusiasm for the church as factors that would make him an excellent preacher for the community His assessment turns out to be accurate after marrying the niece Ira becomes a model preacher giving excellent sermons and supporting the members of the community However he begins to conflict with the deacon s strict ideas about the interpretation of the scriptures in daily life and the Mennonites at least in this film consider conflict within the community at least public conflict an extremely traumatic event something to be avoided at all costs How Ira his family and the community deal with this conflict is the kernel of the plot and it is certainly intellectually involving One of the more refreshing elements of SILENCE AT BETHANY is in how the Mennonites are portrayed Films like WITNESS always portray Quakers or Mennonites as spiritual hermits constrained from emotions and habits which are considered normal by most of us by their faith and customs All the characters in SILENCE AT BETHANY lack the Cecil B DeMille oratorical hang up they discuss love necking and each other with the candidness you would expect from people living in a farm community Really the film centers on how the traditional customs of the community that do exist can survive in post war America None of the characters are stereotypes both Ira s and the deacon s motives are partially out of pride much of the film examines where principals leave off and personality begins And the deacon is never shown as wind up zealot he is concerned with the best way to run the community at a time where the Mennonites status as pacifists is coming under fire from the local draft board The characters in the film often mention relatives and friends who have left the community for another Mennonite settlement due to a disagreement with the Elders it is considered better to leave the people they have grown up with than to live in disharmony with their church The film illustrates just such a case with a fine sense of detail and subtlety As to the film itself the casting stands out more than the acting each member of the cast seems perfectly suited to their role though none stand out over the others this is an asset to a film so absorbed with the idea of community I particularly liked Ira s wife s father the brother of the deacon he provides a character who mediates well between the various characters while maintaining the common sense nature you often find in farmers The film is shot in Pennsylvania while the photography is never exceptional it has that American Playhouse feel to it it works very well with the everyday lifestyles of the characters The music is really poor better suited to a film about concentration camp living than a fairly pleasant rural settlement The composer is Lalo Schifrin a man reknowned for spoiled film music in 30 years he ll only be remembered for the theme to MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and it ll be to his benefit In summary while this film won t get your blood rushing or involve you emotionally very much it is an enjoyable engrossing 90 minute film Since it will probably be on television in a year or two sans interruptions on PBS I recommend you scout your TV listings rather than your local theaters
0331,Souvenir,1988,If I had to pick a film from this year s festival that could cause some real controversy when it s released SOUVENIR would would be right up there Not that it works at being controversial first and foremost it is a character drama but it also takes on the emotional issue of guilt and assigning guilt in the aftermath of a war Christopher Plummer plays Ernst Kestner a widowed grocer who has lived in America since 1950 In 1944 he was with the German army during their occupation of a small French village where he fell in love with a local French girl He was shipped out without seeing here again and has remembers his time with her very romantically After retiring he decides to visit the village again to remind him of his time with her and to find out if she is still alive His estranged daughter Hicks decides to accompany him and his cold reserve to her begins to melt as they approach the village Kestner is in for a massive shock The village is much as he remembered it but it has become a monument to the Nazi war atrocities in reprisal for Resistance attacks the local Gestapo rounded up the women and children of the village and locked them in the town church They then burned it to the ground Included in those who were burned to death was Kestner s lover It is clear that Kestner did not know she had died in the fire but we are left wondering how much did he know And is he to blame That question is constantly left hanging to the audience to Kestner s daughter and to Kestner himself To add further fuel to the moral controversy the town s mayor Lonsdale a famed resistance fighter who rose to political celebrity with his slogan to never forget is very close to attaining a position of national prominence and his previous statements on keeping the memories of World War II alive are in conflict with his plans for European unity Towards the end of the film Kestner becomes a catalyst for the mayor s political decision and Lonsdale reveals information which complicates the web of guilt even further I came out of this movie trying to figure out whether the director was trying to make a specific statement with this film i e whether he favored either side of the argument After a month of contemplation I d have to say no he s just skillful enough to to outline the best arguments on either side and let it play from there While it works as character drama it s equally good at stimulating ideas and outlining conflicts and I ll be interested to hear what others think of it Christopher Plummer gets his best role in years however I keep wondering what other actors could have done with Kestner With Plummer you get the feeling that he s pushing himself to the limit with any kind of emotion Kestner is a very frigid person so this seems appropriate but I felt like I still was missing a large piece of his character by the end of the film Hicks and Cazenove as a hack reporter who stumbles on Kestner and daughter and sees a story in it while doing nothing particularly noteworthy in the acting category keep the film from grinding under its own angst every twenty minutes with their back and forth pleasantries Lonsdale who I ve only seen in DAY OF THE JACKAL and as Drax in MOONRAKER is perfect as the savvy and very intelligent mayor of the village Nothing spectacular but a very involving little film from beginning to end Certainly food for thought and arguments for those of a political bent Recommended for a Tuesday night viewing with coffee afterwards
0332,Shame,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival SHAME Australia 1988 Director Steve Jodrell Screenwriters Beverly Blankenship and Michael Brind Cast Deborra Lee Furness Tony Barry Simone Buchanan Ever see BILLY JACK or the incredibly bad TRIAL OF BILLY JACK I always liked the initial concept i e a violent liberal with Kung Fu skills rather than wiping out commies or Mafia gangsters Billy would wipe up the floor with rednecks who messed with kids minorities hippies peace loving eccentrics or disabled people It s rather incongruous to disembowel folk in the name of peace and love I guess but as a ten year old it did hold a certain logic for me when I saw it at the theater my dad thought it was hilarious Where it really got stupid was in TRIAL where all manor of shocking atrocities were carted across the screen so that the audience was primed to see Billy ream the bad guys As a kid the slaughter and rape scenes really disturbed me as they should have come to think of it when viewing them at a later date they disgusted me because their only purpose was to build the audience up to frenzy rather like atrocities in a Rambo film but that s usually pretty cardboard all around I have that problem with SHAME a film that appears to be a drive in exploitation film with trappings of social justice It opens with a motorcycle rider Furness in black leathers crossing the country in Australia She stops in one of those small towns for bike repairs and right away we know there s some nasty stuff going on because the Sheriff is a good ol boy or mate as this is Australia and the boys and young men in the neighborhood are tossing her crap and suggesting that she get out of town Major conspiracy city it seems She stops at a garage on the outskirts of town where a dour but decent mechanic lets her sleep in the garage while her extremely fine looking Japanese bike the kind that promote chase scenes is being fixed That night the mechanic s daughter he is a widower is verbally assaulted by several of the lads from the town The cycle rider who is a junior barrister on vacation discovers that the daughter was gang raped by a group of the local boys and that her father has not spoken to her since as he thinks it is her fault While waiting for the bike to be fixed Furness gets the girl to open up and realize it wasn t her fault and eventually gets it through the mechanic s head that his daughter was raped A reconciliation of sorts occurs between the two and the daughter and father go to the police station to swear out a complaint against the rapists I was beginning to hope that the film was going to avoid the drive in cliches and do something original like have Furness get these people legally Of course not The main industry of the town is a cannery that keeps most of the population employed and one of the rapists is the son of the owner the Jane Wyman type from Falcon Crest who owns the town and treats the locals like lower class citizens The women does everything but rub her hands together and order the butler to off the mechanic and his family After getting her son and his cohorts out of jail they go on a rampage The barrister trapped with the daughter inside the garage puts on her leathers and revs up the bike Coincidentally the mechanic s mom and the mechanic are fighting off the mob of drunken scumbags with a steam machine so the glowing dials of the motorcycle s instrument panels somewhat more complicated than the one in BLUE THUNDER and the rider now completely obscured in her black leathers and reflective helmet really look mysterious with the smoke swirling around her and the soundtrack music going duh DUH in the background I think you get the picture If this followed the buildup it had been given I expected to find that the cycle was armed with heat seeking missiles No such luck She puts the kid on the back of the cycle and gets her out of there Then the good townspeople get large sticks and track the sadistic little whooses down and turn them over to the sheriff who says the Down Under equivalent of Well gosh darned if you weren t right Ma am The ending and the crimes committed in the rest of the film would have had impact if the kids and rapists weren t such cardboard villains here they seem to be waiting to be knocked down by a Hero Heroine and when the film tries to spotlight them at the end as if they were making moral commentary it s comes off as ludicrous Against realistic deviants it would have been acceptable but the director tries to have an exploitation film and wring his hands over it too and it torked me off It does have good points Furness is quite good at times especially with the daughter and the middle lulled my misgivings about the film away with some good character development around the mechanic and his family But in general rate this a no go
0333,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1988,Hefty German woman Marianne Saegebrecht finds herself stranded at a motel in the middle of the California desert with a bunch of American oddballs She finds friendship and brings some happiness into their lives Film seems somewhat remote and uninvolving during the viewing but grows on you afterwards Two and a half stars The best film I ve seen so far this year Several interlocking stories about young people in the Bronx in 1964 centered around the homecoming of a psychopath just out of prison Offbeat story and dialogue written by the writer of MOONSTRUCK Reminiscent of THE WANDERERS and DINER Three and a half stars A romantic farce set in a village on the Greek island of Rhodes during the tourist season The set of interlocking stories concerning romance entrepreneurialism espionage and art theft is coherent and funny The scenery is incomparable and Jacqueline Bisset although looking her age is still beautiful Only problem in the film is the romance between Bisset and her ex husband played by Edward Fox which is completely lacking in chemistry There s enough in this film to make up for that though Three stars In the Kenya of the Fifties a young African boy whose father has been killed by the Mau Mau is forced to take a job as a kitchen toto or helper in the house of the British chief of police He becomes caught up in the revolution and is divided in his loyalties between the Africans and his British employers The film presents a well rounded and even handed treatment of the British colonials and their African servants but I felt that the treatment of the Mau Mau as evil thugs was too shallow and took away from whatever points the film made on behalf of the British Two and a half stars I read the novel last year and have been looking for the film on video or in a theatre ever since The film by Visconti is a meticulous recreation of the classic novel about a Sicilian prince Burt Lancaster and his adjustment to Italian unification and the rise of the bourgeois society Visconti decided to leave out the last few chapters for time reasons probably although the film still lasts almost three hours which unfortunately tends to blunt the point that the novel tries to make There s still enough here though to make the film worthwhile even if you haven t read the book Three stars I finally got around to seeing this after reading some negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised Something of a romantic fantasy but with intelligent well rounded characters and witty dialogue Cher and Nicolas Cage put in excellent performances and I can t even look at Vincent Gardenia s face with out breaking up Three stars Nothing I say will keep anyone from going to see it but I thought it was a low grade Chinatown with a Howard the Duck ending Yes the technical virtuosity was admirable but that s only enough to give it two stars out of four
0334,Red Heat,1988,Capsule review Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Soviet policeman teamed with a laconic Chicago cop Jim Belushi in Walter Hill s latest police chase film That s the high concept and the rest of the details are filled in just about the way Hill filled them in in 48 HOURS Enjoyable as a summer throwaway Rating 1 Cop films are in this year Maybe it was the automatic success of even the very weak BEVERLY HILLS COP and the marginally better LETHAL WEAPON The most popular formula for the police film is the odd couple That s where you have two mis matched partners who learn to love and respect each other LETHAL WEAPON was a case in point THE ENFORCER was another Formula number two is the lone cop who discovers the force is corrupt and weeds out the bad guys BULLITT may have been one of the first but there were plenty more like SHARKY S MACHINE and BLUE THUNDER The third popular plot is the outsider That one is like a COOGAN S BLUFF and a ROBOCOP where someone of questionable value proves his worth If you want to stretch a point RED SUN fits in here and in category number one Walter Hill combined plots 1 and 3 to make 48 HOURS he has returned to that plot combination for RED HEAT In Moscow perestroika has turned into booming drug traffic Ivan Danko played by Arnold Schwarzenegger a muscle bound Moscow policeman is dispatched to Chicago to pick up an escaped pusher He is chosen because he is already on the case and perhaps because his English is better than his Russian In the U S he ends up teamed up with a wisecracking partner played by Jim Belushi Together they find themselves in the kind of chase Walter Hill films are famous for violent funny more often lethal and with plenty of car chases or rather in this case a bus chase Hill s great understanding of Soviet culture shows up almost immediately with a scene of an apparently co ed public bath house supposedly in a country where nudes in art are considered pornography Of course without this scene the film would have almost no female nudity and authenticity does not sell tickets Then there is the obviously authentic Austrian accent his Moscow policeman has And just to get the audience in the right mood the opening credits have the R s and the N s backwards and no crossbars on the A s O guess that really captures the Soviet feel On a more positive note Hill tells a reasonably enjoyable story with enough action to make the film exciting rather than realistic RED HEAT is however notable for not being really anti Soviet The Soviets are shown as occasionally having effective if brutal means of ridding their society of criminals But hey Hill s audiences have nothing against brutal or they would not still be Hill s audiences RED HEAT could use a few new touches besides the choice of the origin of the outsider cop but it tells its story competently Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0335,Je hais les acteurs,1986,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival I HATE ACTORS France 1986 Director Screenwriter Gerard Krawczyk based on the novel by Ben Hecht Cast Jean Poiret Michel Blanc Bernard Blier Guy Marchand Claude Chabroi In this short span of time we call life we generally learn what to do and what not to do through pleasure displeasure response Yes I know there are other far nobler reasons but the majority of events people and places we avoid are due to repeatedly wretched experiences with them There are exceptions but statistically they all fall into what Jimmy the Greek would call a bad gamble The freeway during rush hour the old buddy who calls you up for a wild time next weekend the restaurant with the waiters who sniff at your Levis And your French comedies I really don t have much to say about this film It s shot in black and white and attempts to be a comic mystery set in the Hollywood of the 1940s It uses make that attempts a lot of physical humor and contains a lot of characters who act stupidly I liked one bit with an Errol Flynn like actor performing a sword fight scene while on lithium but other than that it was a blur It looks particularly sad next to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT Eddie Valiant has it over these goons any day of the week Amazing how little was funny about this film
0336,Consuming Passions,1988,See at the Seattle Film Festival CONSUMING PASSIONS Great Britain 1988 Director Giles Foster Screenwriters Paul D Zimmerman and Andrew Davies based on a play by Michael Palin and Terry Jones Cast Tyler Butterworth Jonathan Pryce Vanessa Redgrave Freddie Jones Prunella Scales This following plot summary hardly gives away anything about this movie since the major plot impetus occurs in the first five minutes Chumley Chocolates that stately family firm has been sold to a Nestles like food corporation saintly old Mr Chumley Freddie Jones with brown stained lips this time around has stayed on as a figurehead but the real power behind the throne is a corporate representative played by Jonathan Pryce in one of those roles where the actor is so perfect for the part that you almost sigh with satisfaction when he s on He s pushed Chumley into selling a new line of chocolates without any chocolate in them he s counting on the high sex advertising to sell them to the British sweet eaters Into the whole shebang comes innocent young nebbish Tyler Butterworth who in his first few clumsy minutes on the job manages to knock three factory workers into the automated chocolate making machine That s the bad news The good news is that only Jones Pryce and Butterworth and the head secretary know what happened On the down side though the chocolate tainted with the bodies of the men has gotten out to a seaside resort Even worse the new chocolates are being poorly received all over the country except in the little seaside community where people just can t get enough of them Well it s clear to Pryce that he s got one heck of a secret ingredient on his hands the question is will Butterworth and Chumley go along with it More importantly where can he get more of the necessary um supplies It s a wonderful set up for the rest of the film and in general it lives up to its potential though it doesn t exceed it There is a long slow period in the middle I suspect that this is where the screenwriters added extra material to stretch the Palin Jones play and it s a rather obvious break But the beginning and end are quite good and the supporting characters carry it as decently as anyone could Particularly hilarious is Vanessa Redgrave as an aging nymphomaniac whose price for silence about her husband s chocolate coated demise is Butterworth s constant attention to her carnal desires I can think of a dozen ways this could have fallen flat into something out of Benny Hill but Redgrave is so inexhaustibly delighted with having Butterworth s services at her beck and call that it really is quite funny her open mouthed grin has to be seen to be appreciated However CONSUMING PASSIONS derives much of the humor from its premise and that s outlined within the first fifteen minutes The rest of the film is fairly standard even though the play was written by a couple of ex Pythons it doesn t get really zany until the end with the hilarious exception of an AIDS prevention poster sight gag preferring to stay with controlled slapstick like A PRIVATE FUNCTION but with less appealing subjects for humor there isn t a character here that you ll have much concern for which is probably a good thing Butterworth in particular becomes rather annoying after awhile he s good as the comic foil to the events overtaking him but at times he seems to be shooting for the title of the British Don Knotts A decent 3 50 film unless you re a fan of British comedies in which case full price is quite acceptable
0337,Other Side of the Wind The,1972,I m not sure whether to call this a retrospective or a review of newly released work Come to think of it it hardly matters it seems unlikely that you will ever see the majority of the films I m about to describe Most of them were brought up by Gary Graver a cinematographer who worked with Welles during the last two decades of his life I ve heard Graver called any number of things a talented collaborator of Welles a hanger on who has lived off Welles memorabilia and other sobriquets I ll leave it that I haven t the slightest idea one way or another I m glad that he provided the clips and films that he did they were certainly of interest to anyone who has followed Welles career in the cinema and his isolation from the mainstream of the film industry Whether the average viewer would enjoy the majority of works shown here that s another question Two parts of THE UNSEEN WELLES Fountain of Youth a wonderful half hour TV pilot for an Orson Welles weekly television playhouse and OTHELLO 1952 shown in a new 35mm print were real treats more about them later The rest of the clips however while being of interest to the film historian were not what could be called of general interest Most were very unfinished and showed the signs of extremely limited budgets and production values It was impressive to see how clever Welles could be with a Super 8 movie camera but the average film viewer would have been bored stiff I think The trailer of F FOR FAKE clips from his unfinished works THE MERCHANT OF VENICE THE DEEP and others were often rather tedious and extremely unfinished no editing sometimes no sound The only set of clips I was fascinated with were from a film Welles attempted around 1967 to 1972 I believe it s a bit fuzzy at the moment called THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND The story deals with a Raoul Walsh like director played by John Huston who is being financed by several producers to do a film marketed at the EASY RIDER audience The film deals with a party the director throws at his ranch where many sixties new wave film makers are invited to attend all with cameras in hand The film yanks back and forth between different cameras point of views and it s a nice touch though a bit tedious towards the end however it was unclear whether this would have been edited down or not when released Also interesting was spotting some of the actors in it Huston Robert Walden Rossi of Lou Grant and a few others whose names have faded in the last month damn I have to start writing these columns when I get home The second set of clips were of two men and a women driving through the rain at night on a desert highway and is one of the most erotic sequences I can remember The final sequences were of a young man who looked and sounded a hell of a lot like an 18 year old John Savage chasing around a naked girl apparently under Huston s direction Huston s character never appears but his voice instructs both in such a way that you wonder if it s supposed to be a scene in Huston s movie or whether the two are really performing their run around with Huston providing sardonic comment Also I was never sure whether the sequences very Sixties appearance were real or the result of Welles wanting to make it look that way the man could affect current fashions faster than People magazine Very impressive though the production values were again dismayingly poor Graver says that the film is co owned by himself and Welles longtime associate lover Oja Palinkas and that when and if they get the money they will work at editing it and releasing it not too subtle hinting there I m surprised a plate wasn t passed around The rest of the evening except for OTHELLO and the TV pilot were clips of Welles doing magic really boring and some out takes from test film No redeeming value whatsoever Considering the show got out so late I left at 11 10 on a Monday night and the German TV documentary The Making of OTHELLO had still not been shown I think Graver could have cut much of this out I refrain from mooning over the cinematic and photographic leftovers of Marilyn Monroe that seem so prolific Orson Welles smoking a cigar for Japanese commercials is even less interesting to me for obvious reasons The evening was still a success however Fountain of Youth was a delightfully droll story about a romantic triangle between a Narcissistic young actress an equally vain tennis pro and a clever professor whose work with glands acts as a potent weapon against his rival This is witty comedy and I wish to heaven that someone would sell the pilot to the people releasing Golden Age television on video this is a gem Unseen for years it was Welles effort to compete with the likes of Texaco Theater and other television dramas directing writing and narrating he brought the pilot in on time and under budget often using slides and silhouettes in an appealing manner that added to the gossip column atmosphere of the play CBS paid him for the pilot and then put it on the shelf They finally showed it during the summer when faced with an empty half hour slot when Edward R Murrow fell ill This was the only time Fountain of Youth was ever broadcast but it went on to win the Peabody Award that year which must have been sweet to Welles after having been shunned by the network If it ever comes out on video I recommend that you get it This is the kind of thing that they don t do on television anymore not even American Playhouse they re all 1 1 2 to 2 hours long and Welles made it a high point of the genre The story unfolds like one of Woody Allen s amusing short stories snappy sardonic and assuming a reasonably intelligent audience The other work was OTHELLO shot in black and white in Spain in an ancient castle it is full of Wellesian camera tricks and angles wonderful moving shots of Welles as Othello striding through the ancient halls the pillars dividing the shots Halliwell asks if this was the best way to film Shakespeare I don t know if it serves as a fit introduction to the Moor for the first time reader but it is a kick to someone who enjoys lively cinematography and who has seen OTHELLO several times before An interesting mix some Olivier like symbolism the hanging cage moderately good acting not great though and the feeling that you re watching a suspense movie at times I half expected Alan Ladd to walk in with a trench coat at the end
0338,Short Circuit 2,1988,It would be hypocritical of me to say that SHORT CIRCUIT 2 is a big come down from SHORT CIRCUIT since frankly I was not much of a fan of the first film Also I hate to see a sequel be too much like the original and it true that SHORT CIRCUIT 2 was not much like its predecessor What it was like was any of dozens of throw away summer films The basic plot could have been done as a sequel to anything from THE LOVE BUG to STARMAN with small variations In fact with the exception of Ally Sheedy s off screen voice in one scene there are only two characters in common with the first film One is Number Five itself now mysteriously called by Everyone Johnny Five the other I am sorry to report to all Asian Indians is Ben the malapropping Indian robotics specialist who is now a toy manufacturer Ben is in a major United States city the script seems to imply it is New York but you see just about every Toronto landmark except Toronto Tower itself He makes a deal with a department store that he will make a thousand toy replicas of Number Five in time for Christmas a deal that gets him involved with small time thieves and big time bank robbers But Number Five is reduced to being just a cute character made out of electronics parts Whether or not he is alive the major point of the first film has little to do with SHORT CIRCUIT 2 All this is not to say that there were not a few fairly funny jokes in SHORT CIRCUIT 2 I remember laughing more than once at what was happening but I frankly expect more from a movie than a few good gags If you think that a dozen or so laughs are worth the price of an admission ticket be my guest My recommendation however is to wait to rent it or see it on cable Rate it a flat 0 on the 4 to 4 scale for the sake of those dozen reasonable gags
0339,Marusa no onna,1987,See at the Seattle Film Festival A TAXING WOMAN Japan 1987 Director Screenwriter Juzo Itami Cast Nobuko Miyamoto Tautomu Yamazaki Masahiko Tsugawa Hideo Murota Rarely has a foreign sub titled film garnered so much attention in the U S I heard two NPR bits and a CBS news report on this before viewing it I abstained from Stanley Kaufman s review in The New Republic not wanting to spoil any surprises The great success of Itami s previous film TAMPOPO in both the US and Japan centered media interest on his latest effort especially since A TAXING WOMAN has been so popular in Japan Also it s subject tax evasion in Japan with the main character a female tax inspector has raised the feelers of various news programs and so has snowballed into popular interest Unfortunately I had a midnight showing the night before and nights of film viewing before that by the time I got to A TAXING WOMAN I was dead tired and barely hanging in there I think I drifted off for about twenty minutes during the first half hour and while I don t feel I missed much I wouldn t feel right about drawing any conclusions For those of you expecting another outrageous comedy like TAMPOPO don t A TAXING WOMAN reminds me a little of those documentry like police dramas that used to appear years ago great effort is expended to show what a tax inspector s life is like It actually looks appealing I mean if you had to pick a job that required you to smoke cigarettes and work 70 hours a week this would probably be my choice However Itami centers on some of the amusing aspects of the job and ends with an ironic tone that seems to question whether or not the taxing is in the best interests of the citizens No grade but I liked what I saw of it Can anyone up on popular Japanese culture explain the significance of the blood stained handkerchief that the financier gives Ryoko Miyamoto I m curious
0340,Playing Away,1986,See at the Seattle Film Festival PLAYING AWAY Great Britain 1986 Directed Horace Ove Screenwriter Vijay Amarnani and Caryl Phillips Cast Norman Beaton Robert Urquhart Helen Lindsay Nicholas Farrell This is one of those little character films which are such a delight to find at the festival they pick you up for a couple of hours and let you down emotionally and mentally sated PLAYING AWAY is a study in the contrasts and similarities of two modern British cultures One is the familiar to filmgoers anyway country village replate with farmers the good hearted local minister and a few of the gentry It also has a collection of surly disaffected teenagers found even in rural Britain The other culture is represented by a cricket team of West Indian immigrants living in a black London neighborhood These left their home to come to London and get jobs now their jobs are becoming endangered by the poor economy and their race their children seem to be falling into the morass of urban blight and they miss the islands greatly The two cultures run into one another when the villagers invite the city team for a weekend cricket match in their town The two groups meeting tends to bring out the best and worst in several people much of it is very funny but some of it is frightening and not at all attractive What makes it work as either comedy or drama is how carefully the characters are drawn within the 100 minutes of the film Each member of either team is brought to the point where at the end of the film you feel as if you know them all quite well What makes the film so much fun is watching how the various characters from both sides of the fence deal with each other or fail to scenes like the meeting between Willie Boy the leader of the city team and the local squire are a delight some people find they have much in common while others find they have nothing or so they think The cricket match itself at the end is something of an anti climax and suffers from slo mo sports sickness a bit too much But it never lags below a rating of good and the ending gives you some faith that the good in people can find the good in other people no matter how great the difference of birth and background are Rating 3 50 4 00 film Perfect for an early weekday or a Sunday evening
0341,Sinnui yauman,1987,I ve been trying to figure out how to describe the sheer fun I had at this film I haven t seen anything that mixed this many genres and kept me this hooked since ALIENS I hear the VILLAGE VOICE said it combined the best elements of THE PRINCESS BRIDE and EVIL DEAD II and recommended that no amphetamines be taken before viewing it This is a wise move A CHINESE GHOST STORY has more energy in it then last year s entire summer film season with the lone exception of ROBOCOP and a damn site more adventure than the last four LucasFilm entries It also combines romance horror adventure martial arts comedy and satire and does each one well I think you ll have the time of your life there frankly this is BUCKAROO BANZAI style genre mixing if you know what I mean and I know you do Well what we got We got a foolish young tax collector whose in bad with the local yokels and decides to spend the night at a haunted shrine We have a beautiful young thing he falls in love with but who has a terrible secret We got a bad ass old samurai who s sharing the shrine with the lad he bounces off of trees fires rays from his hands does a rap number right in the middle of the film and gets to say the kind of great things that Warren Oates always got to say in his films We got zombies ghosts hags stupid warrior types and a 40 foot animated tongue Ho boy This is my kind of neighborhood Damndest thing is it works great as a love story as a folk tale and as an adventure The plot and the samurai add a real tongue in cheek feeling to the works and the martial arts sequences takes those leaping forty feet in the air sequences you see on Channel 61 s Hong Kong Theater every Sunday morning and jacks them up about 400 I really got to caring about whether the lad and the sweet young thing were going to make it This is great stuff Good photography though on a budget and a lot of the sub titles are misspelled but that kinda adds to the flavor first sub titled film I ve been to where you d hear people asking What did he say Rating Faded if not seen on a weekend night However worth every penny of 5 if seen at midnight movie preferably with cronies and munchies Wouldn t be bad on video either Leave the diet pills at home

0343,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1988,Capsule review In a world where Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny really could come knocking at your door nearly anything can happen WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a rather dull mystery plot set on a really great background where cartoon characters rub shoulders with living humans Technical credits and inspiration of having the favorite cartoon characters of the 1940s come together in one film make the plot inadequacies seem unimportant Rating 2 Back in the three or four years after the Second World War two different sorts of films were reaching their heyday One was the hard boiled detective film which made a tentative start before the war with a few films like THE MALTESE FALCON had dried up a little during the war years then really hit its stride with films like MURDER MY SWEET THE BIG SLEEP and LADY IN THE LAKE At the same time Chuck Jones cartoon characters began taking on the shapes and styles familiar to modern viewers But no two styles of film could be much further apart than the film noir detective story and the cartoon form At least that was the case until Gary Wolf wrote the mystery novel WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT Wolf set his story in those post war years but took out the blacks that Raymond Chandler s detective called shines and replaced them with toons the characters of cartoons In this world cartoons are just live action films in which all the actors are toons Adjoining Los Angeles is the ghetto where all the toon actors live a place called Toontwon Against this background the film WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT takes place And the background is what is important in this film In the foreground is a sort of prosaic mystery story in which tough guy humor detective Eddie Valiant valiantly played by Bob Hoskins is looking for the real killer in a murder case in which the police strongly suspect famous cartoon star Roger Rabbit Valiant at least initially thinks Roger is innocent but he is not so sure about Roger s buxom wife Jessica Rabbit Don t let the name fool you she is a very human looking toon The mystery story is not a very good one and its resolution is disappointingly bad but it is unlikely that that will disappoint much of the audience What may resonate a little is the statement against bigotry against toons or humans The technical effect of mixing live action and cartoon will definitely dazzle most audiences The integration of live action and cartoon reputed to be flawless is at least technically very very good Just occasionally we find Bob Hoskins looking a little too high as he talks to Roger The animators had after the fact placed the top of Roger s head rather than Roger s eyes in Hoskins line of vision But that quibble aside this film goes many orders of magnitude beyond any previous such mixing The cartoon characters in the real world have a three dimensional quality resulting from careful use of shadow no explanation why they do not have shadowing when they appear in cartoons Among the interesting touches are the attempts to make toons work consistently in the real world Clearly the laws of physics do not work the same in cartoons as they do in the real world but when you start separating cartoon characters from cartoon settings you have to decide which side gets the ability to break with physical law As it turns out logically or not both sides get it to some extent Roger tends to rocket around a real world room when he drinks a glass of whiskey But a human in Toontown also gets some special cartoon protection like being able to survive falls Apparently toons have magic both in themselves and in their setting WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a cooperation between the two traditional competitors Steven Spielberg s Amblin Entertainment and Walt Disney Enterprises who decided late in the production that this film would be a Touchstone film and not a Walt Disney film Perhaps they wanted it released through their adult division because of some violence though their professed reason was that Jessica Rabbit was a little too well endowed and a little under dressed for a child audience That cooperation and either the money it brought or the inspiration of the project bred more cooperation As Disney was one of the production companies getting permission to use Disney cartoon characters was probably no problem but somehow they managed to get Warner Brothers characters complete with Mel Blanc s voice so you could have Daffy Duck on screen with Donald Duck and making wisecracks about Donald s speech impediment Donald may have been wisecracking back but with Donald who can tell Woody Woodpecker and hosts of other cartoon characters are also on hand For humans the cast is no so star studded but Christopher Lloyd is on hand with another weird character for director Robert Zemeckis BACK TO THE FUTURE Then there are Kathleen Turner and Amy Irving who do the voice for Jessica Turner does the speaking Irving does the singing WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a great film for lots of reasons many of which have little to do with the actual plot Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0344,Da,1988,Martin Sheen s character is a popular New York playwright in the middle of preparations for an opening night performance One morning he receives a long distance call from Ireland his father affectionately named Da by Sheen has died Sheen flies back to attend the wake and take care of arranging his father s business affairs Then in a rather matter of fact manner Sheen begins to see his deceased rapscallion of a father Hughes wandering around the house The rest of the film is taken up with conversations between Hughes and Sheen sometimes there are flashbacks sometimes Sheen appears and converses with his earlier self It s basically a stage play adapted to film very well mind you where two men become familiar with one another after many years even though one of them is dead On a film like this you have to grade on acting and script because plot is really not there for the majority of DA it s just two men talking And the script is good though not particularly funny or touching It s comfortable you can watch it and have your attention held but it leaves plenty of room on the back burner of the brain for other things Hughes acting is rather like that too comfortable He s playing the old Irish rapscallion with just the right amount of blarney he never really tries to be more than a codger Sheen on the other hand has to attempt jumping from an adult to a sometimes reminiscing child in an adult s body he doesn t do very well with the latter The really standout performance is William Hickey as a financier in the village who took young Sheen under his arm and was a marked contrast from Sheen s anarchist father Hickey also gets all the best lines with his scratchy voice and shrunken face he walks off with some wonderful bits during his short appearances But generally you re left with Hughes and Sheen and while that isn t objectionable it isn t enough Rating Not bad but I d rather wait for it appear on TV and even then I think I d read a book instead
0345,Out of Rosenheim,1988,Seem at the Seattle Film Festival BAGDAD CAFE West Germany 1987 Director Screenwriter Percy Adlon Cast Marianne Sagebrecht CCH Pounder Jack Palance Christine Kaufman BAGDAD CAFE is one of those comedies that derives much of its humor from the strangeness of its characters The question I think is critical to rating such a picture is this how long did it take for the characters to become more funny than strange In the case of this film about twenty minutes The Bagdad Cafe is a run down little cafe that Brenda Pounder runs It s dilapidated frequented only by truckers and home for a number of rather odd people Brenda herself her rather dim witted husband her two children one is an abandoned father of a little tyke who plays classical music all the time while the other is a beautiful teenager whose attentions are favored by the local bikers truckers and high school kids her Indian counterman and cook Then there s the residents of the adjacent motel a hooker who does tattoo work on the side and Jack Palance as a Hollywood drop out from the sixties who seems absolutely delighted with whatever is going on Into this steps Jasmin Sagebrecht a stout Bavarian woman who has just left her husband during their visit to the United States She knows little English and her first encounter as she walks down the highway her American Tourister luggage wheeling along behind her is The Bagdad Brenda is in a really bad mood as her husband just left her he sits about a half mile away in a car watching the Bagdad through binoculars and muttering Oh Brenda Due to a number of misunderstandings it takes Brenda and Jasmin a while to hit it off but when they do a bubbly infectious happiness seems to grasp the entire group of characters indeed one leaves because things are too compatible From there this giddiness doesn t threaten to overwhelm BAGDAD CAFE it does overwhelm it slamming it and the audience into a grinning choke hold for the rest of the film BAGDAD CAFE won the Golden Space Needle Award I hear you gasp for best picture and it certainly seemed to be a crowd pleaser the audience I left with seemed to be buzzing about how good it was I felt it had a slow beginning and slow ending but then I m not as enchanted with unusual characters being one myself I guess Palance character was a delight but it gets a bit too giddy for my tastes at the end Still a heckuva lotta fun with a big audience Rating 3 50 or 4 film
0346,Out Cold,1989,See at the Seattle Film Festival OUT COLD USA 1988 Director Malcolm Mowbray Screenwriters George Malko Leonard Glasser Cast Teri Garr John Lithgow Randy Quaid Bruce McGill This was the closing night show at the festival we were supposed to have gotten Coppola and Lucas s TUCKER but they apparently pulled out at the last minute I wish I could tell you that OUT COLD was a fine substitute but if this film is never screened anywhere else it will be better for everyone s career BLOOD SIMPLE has a lot to answer for There must be at least five films about with Film Noir subjects friend kills friend so that he can get at friend s wife etc that have been played for laughs over the last few years OUT COLD is the latest and one of the least funny It opens in the butcher shop of Ernie and Dave two Vietnam war buddies who started up a deli when they got out of the army Ernie McGill is a womanizing asshole who picks on his conniving wife Sunny Garr and leaves all the work to his meek pleasant partner Dave Lithgow Garr wants a divorce so she hires inept private detective Lester Atlas Quaid to track down Ernie s girlfriends one night after Dave and Ernie have had a fight Sunny wanders in finds Ernie waking up in the meat locker from a punch in the jaw from Dave who has left in a huff decides that it would be to her advantage to shut the door to said locker in Ernie s face and does so Dave gets there the next morning to find Ernie frozen in the locker and assumes he did it Sunny would love to have it end that way however Lester Atlas followed Ernie last night and mistook Sunny in a wig for Ernie s lover From there we go onto a long track as Sunny attempts to manipulate Atlas into thinking that Ernie has left to go hunting and Dave to get rid of the body It s kind of like a poor I Love Lucy episode with black humor and a cast of unappealing actors Garr is never funny just bitchy as is McGill but at least he s dead through the majority of the film Quaid plays a detective so stupid that he makes Inspector Clouseau look like Columbo the dumb act and his slob habits are brainless slapstick and very dull Dave is the only character who s likable in the whole film but he s such a colorless guy that you really don t care about him Which makes for a pretty barren movie gang I don t know when this is coming out but stay away from it when it does A comedy without one redeeming feature to it Thumbs down
0347,Belly of an Architect The,1987,See at the Seattle Film Festival THE BELLY OF AN ARCHITECT Great Britain 1987 Director Screenwriter Peter Greenaway Cast Brian Dennehy Chloe Webb Lambert Wilson Vanni Corbellini I made a special point of going to see THE BELLY OF AN ARCHITECT since I had heard that due to legal hassles it may never see the light of day I wish I could tell you that its absence from distribution would be a shame unfortunately I was totally at sea during the entire picture The plot itself is interesting a noted Chicago architect Stourley Kracklite Dennehy and his much younger wife Webb travel to Rome so that Kracklite can fulfill a dream design a tribute to the 18th century architect Etienne Louis Boullee Kracklite is obsessed with Boullee and his health begins to fail under the strain of getting the tribute prepared in time for the opening Several of his sponsors are trying to turn it into a more commercial affair than Kracklite would like and one Wilson begins to seduce Kracklite s wife This drives Kracklite further into his obsession he begins to write letters to Boullee describing his problems his gastric problems which mimic Boullee s become serious and he wonders if his wife is poisoning him like Alexander s wife did a famous statue of Alexander was done by Boullee He also has an annoying habit of punching people in the nose though almost every Italian in this film is portrayed as being an asshole it is not a promotional picture for visiting Rome in that sense I won t get into the conclusion but you basically have the plot right there and there are few surprises No one is really very sympathetic in the film Kracklite s wife and Kracklite basically work at destroying the other and while you feel sorry for Kracklite as he breaks down it s not the type of artistic obsession you can empathize with Wilson and his very strange sister and weasel like flunky would be a pleasure to throw off a bridge The photography is fairly staid and things move at a snail s pace About the only good thing I can say about it is that the shots of the Roman architecture are spectacular but I am sure there are several PBS documentaries on Italian Architecture which could provide just as much scenic pleasure while sparing us the angst
0348,Bellman and True,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival BELLMAN AND TRUE Great Britain 1987 Director Richard Loncraine Screenwriters Desmond Lowden Richard Loncraine Michael Wearing from a novel by Desmond Lowden Cast Bernard Hill Kieran O Brien Richard Hope Frances Tomelty BELLMAN AND TRUE is a caper film and one of the very best ones in recent memory What it lacks in sympathetic characters it makes up for in realism and technical panache and in controlled on key acting The film opens with an engineer named Hiller Hill and his stepson on the lam from some criminals Hiller was paid to go in and steal some information about the company he worked for from their computer banks instead he took the money and ran They catch up with him and get him to decode the information they are looking for Hiller also learns that the information will be used to rob one of the most heavily guarded banks in Britain his technical abilities are in demand and he decides to throw in with the caper Outside of Hiller and his son there are hardly any sympathetic characters the burglars may be interesting ingenious and remarkable in their old world new world thinking but they are also brutal and quite willing of kill anyone who stops them from the heist or causes problems afterward So the audience is left rooting for the father and son combo and this works very well thanks to Hill s understated performance Both are people who ve never been particularly well treated by anyone before the other came along and their love for one another is the only warm tender thing in either of their worlds or this movie They form a nucleus that one worries over during the course of the film And rightly so It s a dangerous break in but fascinating in its ingenuity The technical jargon is right on how often does that happen eh and is as intriguing as the British underworld jargon bellman is the title of Hiller s job to disable the alarm systems It is particularly fascinating to see how the thieves deal with the new technology and the new gangland ethics the money man for the operation is a yuppie who none of the burglars seem to be too enthused with At any rate the suspense is palpable throughout and everything is down to Earth including the ending which has constantly been reported as unbelievable by other critics I can t imagine why the entire film seems enormously plausible
0349,Bat Whispers The,1930,See at the Seattle Film Festival THE BAT WHISPERS USA 1930 Director Screenwriter Roland West from a play by Avery Hopwood and Mary Roberts Rinehart Cast Chester Morris Una Merkel Grayce Hampton Maude Eburne William Bakewell Gustav von Seyffertitz First the archival notes THE BAT WHISPERS is one of the first films shown in 65mm as opposed to the 35mm which is still the standard for films today and has been restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive Technically it s a piece of history with it s use of the big screen and numerous moving shots that are striking even today The plot is that there s a master thief by the name of The Bat who is going around stealing murdering and basically making the police look like bumbling amateurs However a rival thief has stolen some valuable jewels before The Bat can swipe them himself and the looney tunes burglar dressed up in full cape and everything trails the New Crook on the Block to a old mansion owned by a decisive matriarch and her annoyingly loud comic relief maid that maid s whining was enough to almost for me to wish for Jason to make an appearance Lots of characters arrive and we have to figure out who is the Bat and who is his rival criminal This film has all the signs of being made just after the switch to sound everyone overacts outrageously and uses pantomime to ridiculous degrees but none more than Chester Morris winner of the coveted Life Achievement award for Cheesy Acting His eyes roll he stares into the night muttering melodramatic nothings He was fun to watch I ll admit Outside of that folks this film must have been the Member s Choice at the Over The Top Acting Hall of Fame It was adapted from a stage play and was basically filmed that way except for several miniatures and outdoor shots It reminded me of a game of Clue the characters have all the personality of wooden inch high markers and are stereotypical to the point of exasperation A crazed butler with a hunchback A sinister doctor vith a Transylvanian accent A cowardly old maid A hopeless gumshoe A masked criminal mastermind CrimeCausers Handbook any real criminal mastermind doesn t need a mask He or she hires someone else to do their duty work A truly mechanical script too I m willing to take into account that this is a 1930s film but really the audience was laughing at it throughout the whole thing however not enough to justify seeing the film Rating Not advised unless you re keenly very very keenly interested in the history of the American cinema Or you want to learn how make the eyes roll back into your head
0351,Un zoo la nuit,1987,Seen at the Seattle Film Festival NIGHT ZOO Canada 1987 Director Screenwriter Jean Claude Lauzon Cast Roger Le Bel Gilles Maheu Lynne Adams Lorne Brass Germain Houde NIGHT ZOO had a lot of good word of mouth before it reached the festival and I was looking forward to seeing it Set in Montreal it talks about an ex con named Marcel who is released after serving a sentence for drug smuggling Upon returning to his apartment he is rousted by a pair of sadistic cops who he sold the drugs for Marcel hid the money before getting inside and the cops want it back At the same time his father and he are estranged and his father is in very poor health As Marcel s situation with the two cops becomes more tense the wall between father and son crumbles and he plans to take his father away from the cesspool of the city NIGHT ZOO has mainly been praised for being able to move between dark very brutal crime drama and the tender relationship between Marcel and his father I d agree with that up to a point the scenes with Marcel and his father fishing and their gradual reconciliation are quite good However the final hunting trip at the end just becomes odd and the drug smuggling plot is resolved as an afterthought The photography is quite good and reminded me somewhat of DIVA slick city views combined with romantic shots of the country The story though lacks staying power and the performances while good need more support from the story
0353,Wives Under Suspicion,1938,The following films were part of William K Everson s Hollywood and the Code series at the Seattle International Film Festival A KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR USA 1932 Director James Whale Cast Frank Morgan Paul Lukas Nancy Carroll Jean Dixon Gloria Stuart Walter Pidgeon WIVES UNDER SUSPICION USA 1938 Director James Whale Cast Warren William Gail Patrick Constance Moore William Lundigan Ralph Morgan In this double feature Everson gave us a rare opportunity to see how the same film fared when it was shot before and after the institution of the code What s more it had the same director and even better an excellent one James Whale who is best known for FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN A KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR tells the story of a husband in Vienna Paul Lukas who shoots his wife when he finds her in a tryst with her lover His old friend and lawyer Frank Morgan takes on the case Lukas tells Morgan how he slowly began to suspect his wife one incident in particular is used to illustrate the moment he knew she was cheating on him Morgan begins to become obsessed with the case so much so that he first begins neglecting his younger wife and then suspecting her of infidelity herself There is a lot of playing with the characters and audience s heads we re often wondering if it s all in his mind or whether he has reasons to believe it s true It becomes obvious about halfway through that it is true and Morgan begins to use the case to psychologically torment his wife ah Vienna waits for you describing how he will show Lukas was justified in shooting his wife for her unfaithfulness Lukas paradoxically is telling Morgan not to kill his wife because he realizes that his life is now empty without his wife whether he is convicted or not By this time Morgan is somewhat mad and his speech to the jury is fantastic and impassioned which works and Lukas goes free waiting to leave the country long enough to convince Morgan not to commit murder There is a scene at the house where Morgan and his wife reconcile an excellent scene and really not melodramatic at all This is a quality film throughout part thriller and part melodrama but mixed well and given the sophisticated European flavor many of Whale s films had The sets were in fact leftovers from FRANKENSTEIN which could explain why the prosecutor s office looks like a dungeon in a castle you ought to see what Lukas cell looks like The film didn t create much of a stir with the reformists apparently Everson says that films set in Europe could get away with a good deal more since the public viewed Europeans as lacking the moral fiber of Americans Good character performances and production values and very well shot Not a classic but enjoyable to watch Years later Universal wanted Whale to recreate his success of A KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR by refilming it in a B picture WIVES UNDER SUSPICION It was something of a step down for Whale he had finished SHOWBOAT and was then began being assigned to lesser films apparently the studio was trying to get rid of him while his films returned their investment several times over they were usually more expensive than average Anyway the story of A KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR had to be horribly mutilated to fit within code guidelines Everson pointed out that the lower quality of WIVES UNDER SUSPICION was partly because of it s B movie status poorer actors cheaper sets but the film obviously has a lot of other problems as well First it s set in some big city with Warren Williams playing a crusading DA who decides to prosecute a professor who kills his wife The fellow tells the same story from the first film and Williams begins to suspect his wife However here it is obvious that she is totally faithful to him and that they are all delusions on his part the Code couldn t let any hint of impropriety actually be going on without the wife being punished It ends in a particularly stupid boring manner which fits the rest of the movie The husband as played by Williams is supposed to be a crusading DA but instead comes off as an insensitive dickhead the kind whose noses Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin enjoyed twisting in Rex Stout s novels And the wife is hardly sympathetic after uttering one of the worst intentional racial slurs I ve ever seen on the screen or Everson s he said this was crude even by late thirties standards to the horribly stereotyped black maid in the film For all the Code s talk of censoring racially offensive material from the film industry this is obviously evidence that it was paying only lip service to its doctrine I doubt you ll ever see this film even on TV but if so switch it off However A KISS BEFORE THE MIRROR is worth a glance an entertaining example of elegant melodrama which they certainly don t make anymore
0354,Born To Be Bad,1934,Both of these films were shown in conjunction with the Hollywood and the Code Series at the Seattle Film Festival BABY FACE USA 1933 Director Alfred E Green Cast Barbara Stanwyck George Brent Donald Cook Margaret Lindsay Douglas Drumbille John Wayne BABY FACE and BORN TO BE BAD are rather interesting sides of the same coin The first made in 1933 and listed by William Everson as one of the films most responsible for the institution of the code is a surprisingly entertaining story of a down and out girl from the slums who sleeps her way to the top of a corporation Barbara Stanwyck redeems the film a good deal with her presence but it has appeals beyond that To get a job in a major business office she takes advantage of the considerable number of dorks who promote her to the top in exchange for her affections After a fall from grace so to speak she is given a position of responsibility in France which she does extremely well on her own even though she s never heard French or studied accounting well she is Barbara Stanwyck When the Big Boss falls in love with her on the up and up she plays along but she believes that all she s interested in is his money the interplay between her and Brent is excellent she tosses in a couple lines that Mae West would have been proud of Right at the end she realizes that she does love him surprise surprise and it has a rewritten ending that combines a happy ending with a fate that was supposed to satisfy the punishment of evil theme that the religious reformists were crying for her husband and she give up all their money to get his company back on its feet and they go to work in the factory town she came from until the company hits the big time at the very end I really enjoyed this for a number of reasons though Stanwyck was the main point She plays a woman who is much smarter than the bozos she s working for cynical but very intelligent capable of doing anything they toss at her legitimately and able to manipulate them in a number of ways The romance between her and Brent works rather well he knows what she s done but loves her anyway and doesn t treat her like the Scarlet Woman he treats her indiscretions as minor ones when he first meets her as opposed to the pull out the crucifixes and garlic attitude that other films impose on such characters And the performances are rarely dated especially Stanwyck s her early scenes in the mill town have a particularly gritty realistic feel for Hollywood Right before the code was instated a lot of the tawdry films were rationalized by the studios as moral parables Rather than watch some character doing naughty bits you held up that person s behavior and insured that she came to a bad end A prime example and another film Everson used as a precursor to the code is a ridiculous film named BORN TO BE BAD with Loretta Young as a beautiful young woman with a son born out of wedlock Henry Travers in an immensely annoying performance Everson listed it as the single worst child performance he d ever seen and I see no reason to dispute it even the kid in DONDI had more appeal than this Young is tough but appealing but the script is so stupid that nothing could help it Young tries to put her kid up to a false injury suit against Cary Grant s dairy he s the president of a huge milk company but is driving the truck that Young s brat runs in front of because one of my employees was ill Sure and I bet you fill in for your secretary too Cary Once the false nature of her claims against Grant become apparent the court takes Travers away to a home for wayward boys where Grant decides to be a foster home for the boy Grant s wife so saintly the audience was breaking up and Grant work towards reforming the kid so Young decides the only way to get the kid back is to vamp Grant After being utterly goody goody and refusing all Young s attempts put this in Cary Grant ese You re bad bad bad a bad girl she shows up in flimsy evening gown and ba boom From here it gets really ludicrous as Grant makes love to her in his own house and keeps her there Those lusty dairy magnates and his wife get this decides to release him to true love and gets ready to leave but not before she saves Obnoxio the boy wonder from a fall in the pool Of course Loretta sees things in a new light leaves kid to live with Grant and wife and goes to work in the bookstore where she gave birth to the kid in first place The entire thing is such a hoary failure that today it s tough to see why people got upset But of course we ve had DALLAS and DYNASTY to guide us through such bathos Side observations Young has a tendency to run around in her undies there is a pretty offensive stereotype of a Jewish shyster lawyer and the comment That s white of you which Everson said was fairly common for that period One of the things I found most unpleasant was how Grant is viewed as some sort of innocent throughout it OK he has a baby face but still as if it s all Young s fault that he jumped her there was a lot of women hissing from the peanut gallery at The Egyptian and I don t blame them BABY FACE is heads above this both from the script and from the acting
0355,Phantasm II,1988,Capsule review PHANTASM II is a parasite of a film that does nothing to advance the director s planned trilogy and only exploits the popularity of its predecessor It panders to a teenage audience by making a teenager the only thinking character and by throwing in bits of other recent successful films The parts of the film that are coherent enough to make sense don t it s all spectacle and no characters or logic Rating 2 Nine years ago there was a revolution of sorts in horror films brought about by advances in makeup technology The idea of prosthetic makeup meant that you could show things on screen that could only be shown poorly on screen if at all in the past If you wanted to show a man turn into a werewolf monster on screen you did not have to resort to pieced together double exposures that had been the best way to handle the effect since the 1940s Pneumatic air bladders and mechanical effects allowed realistic looking transformation effects on screen With a concentration on new effects technology many low budget horror films were made in a race to show the public new sights and effects Artistically it was a disaster as many of the films had little to offer but visual effects many of which were intended to gross out the audience For every CAT PEOPLE or THE HOWLING there were a dozen films that were purely a waste of time with no concepts behind them no artistry and a generally weak script Somewhat above average was Don Coscarelli s PHANTASM It sold itself on a gross out special effect a sort of flying drill best not described but all the strange things happening at the film s mortuary some not frightening but very strange for a horror film turned out to make sense in terms of a more interesting science fantasy premise Coscarelli has said that PHANTASM was only the first part of a trilogy that would expand on the initial premise PHANTASM II is the second film By the looks of it it may be the last Thematically it is hard to believe Coscarelli is planning a trilogy because PHANTASM II does not advance the story at all There is virtually nothing certainly nothing of value that is in the sequel that was not in the first film Mike who was a boy in the first film and is nineteen in this film now he is played by James Le Gros returns with his adult sidekick Reggie played by Reggie Bannister to play Rambo at whatever mortuary the Tall Man still played by Angus Scrimm has currently set up shop in Since Mike is now nineteen they have to add a sex interest for him and so they crudely add Liz played by Paula Irvine by claiming that for years she has been psychically linked to Mike and now they are finally meeting Clever plotting PHANTASM II is a very poor piece of storytelling It assumes the viewer has seen the first and remembers it After nine years it was not easy Even with a liberal piece of re used footage much of the film is incoherent and does not explain what is going on Unlike the first film PHANTASM II very consciously attempts to appeal to a teenage audience All the good ideas come from the teenager who apparently is the only character who thinks There is a conscious effort to infuse the plot with heavy handweapons sawed off shotguns and flame throwers popular with a teenage audience There are also more visceral special effects The first film pretty much contented itself with showing mustard colored blood PHANTASM II s effects of showing creatures coming out of human bodies and machines burrowing in are state of the art in an effects technology that has really taken a wrong and regrettable turn That these effects should change so much yet the scenes connected with the premise of the film are so unchanged leads one to really question Coscarelli s values The script for PHANTASM II contains a wide variety of logic flaws The characters get their high tech weaponry by building it themselves one night when they break into what is apparently a hardware store For reasons unexplained no alarms go off Among the goods they apparently get in the raid are shotguns and hand grenades I guess you really can get all your hardware needs at your True Value Store When they are all done being basically honest they drop a wad of money in the till That leads one to wonder about the need to break in at all We have all seen in swashbucklers the classic tense swordfight scene in which the bad guy has the good guy down and raises his sword over his head for the last stroke and while the sword is up the good guy uses the opening to go for the stomach and win PHANTASM II has the identical scene with chainsaws Only one problem the scene makes no sense with chainsaws A broadsword needs some momentum to cut a chainsaw does not There is no reason to pull back a chainsaw so that your last stroke has more momentum One of the characters is in a villain s control at one point The villain is about to pop her into a crematorium oven For no reason other than to build tension he starts doing other crematorium chores instead Then when her turn comes he puts her on the roller track leading to the oven and walks away He then is surprised to find out she just rolled herself off the track to avoid the oven There is more and worse to say about PHANTASM II But suffice it to say that Coscarelli probably ruined his chances at a trilogy and certainly a lot of public interest in that trilogy by turning out such a bad excuse for a film The biggest horror fan I know fell asleep on PHANTASM II and later said she was glad she had But if you have a nice comfortable bed at home there s no reason to go and see this film at all Thinking about the film I am tempted to lower it to a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale but I will settle for the 2 I gave it in the theater The only reason I said so much about a film I would rather forget is that I had a boring car ride from Massachusetts to New Jersey and I had to fill the time somehow
0358,Story of Temple Drake The,1933,The following two films were shown in William K Everson s Hollywood and the Code series at the Seattle International Film Festival THE STORY OF TEMPLE DRAKE USA 1933 Director Stephen Roberts Cast Miriam Hopkins Jack LaRue William Gargan NIGHT NURSE USA 1931 Director William Wellman Cast Barbara Stanwyck Clark Gable Joan Blondell Ben Lyon Charlotte Merriam Charles Winninger THE STORY OF TEMPLE DRAKE was used by Everson to illustrate the problems of adapting a work that dealt with material considered too risque for the times While previous films examined in this series had added elements of sex and violence to attract audiences TEMPLE DRAKE is a film which contains these elements but doesn t attempting to pander to the public For years several people at Paramount had wanted to film William Faulkner s short story Sanctuary however it was always considered an impossibility as the subject matter a young southern girl who is raped and then abducted by a hood was considered way too touchy for that period Finally after much cajoling Paramount was able to get it made It has the texture of a Warner s crime drama in many several senses and much is hinted at rather than explicitly shown the actual rape scene is basically communicated by a candle approaching Drake s bed and a scream It also has more of a social conscious than most films of the times the hero of the film a public defender in a small Southern town is defending blacks before the imperious Judge Drake Temple s grandfather The Judge s continuing ideas of Southern classes are seen as generally corroding his daughter and his community towards the end Ironically the film raised little controversy because the publicity was fairly non exploitive in theme However it was one of the last films of its type to make it through the Hollywood studio system until the loosening of the code in 1938 NIGHT NURSE was one of the other films that Everson had listed as being most instrumental in the institution of the code with a title like NIGHT NURSE you might guess that this isn t exactly MY BRILLIANT CAREER Barbara Stanwyck becomes a nurse trainee in a local hospital where the doctors and nurses all seem pretty cynical these people make St Elsewhere look like a paradise She teams up with another trainee Blondell who wants to use her position as a nurse to find some rich old patient to marry She also befriends one of the nicest bootleggers I ve ever seen in the movies a chap who looks like he sells magazines to get through State U except that he meets Stanwyck to have a bullet removed from his arm Guy just radiates boy next door charm and we can tell that these two are made for each other After nurse graduation or whatever the hell they call it the two women take a job nursing a pair of children who as it turns out are being starved to death Their mother a rich alcoholic is being seduced by her evil chauffeur played by Clark Gable dressed like Kato he plans to scrag the kids and marry their mother so that he can get all the money also he probably knows that the lovable tykes will laugh at how his ears stick out Gable has arranged for the kids doctor to be a drug addicted surgeon we know this because he twitches like a fiend who confines the little girls to their room without food The children look remarkably healthy by the way except that they swoon every five minutes from hunger Stanwyck of course won t stand for it and after haggling with a decent doctor at the hospital to skip ethics rather like Jack Klugman as Quincy but with better legs she gets him to come in and save the girl Gable tries to put a stop to it but Stanwyck s boyish mobster gets the drop on him and makes fun of his ears The girls are fine the quack doctor brought up on charges and Gable apparently goes for a ride The last scene is Stanwyck and boyfriend driving off into the sunset So honey who would you like me to rub out next It was something of an exploitation film extremely tawdry in Everson s best British accent the really isn t a really sympathetic character outside of Stanwyck though by today s standards the bootlegger would be a saint compared to Chuck Norris or Dirty Harry Blondell and Stanwyck spend an inordinate amount of time in their lingerie Gable punches Stanwyck I mean punches bloody nose and everything I expected to see her lay him out as she is definitely the toughest character in the cast All in all this would almost be worth watching for unintentional laughs and Stanwyck of course holds your attention
0359,Desire,1936,The following film concluded William K Everson s Hollywood and the Code series DESIRE USA 1936 Producer Ernst Lubitsch Director Frank Borzage Cast Marlene Dietrich Gary Cooper John Halliday William Frawley Akim Tamiroff Ernest Cossart Alan Mowbray Zeffie Tilbury When watching old films every once in a while you come across a real gem sometimes it s one that has been remarked upon like BRINGING UP BABY and sometimes it comes out of the blue Here s one of the latter a romantic comedy which is a pleasure to sit through and a star combination Cooper and Dietrich which is dazzling to watch It was picked for the Hollywood Code series due to its producer s ability to weave innuendo with innocence in a film that deals with a jewel thief s attempts to smuggle pearls it s ironic to see how Lubitsch smuggles Cooper into Dietrich s bedroom and gets her off scott free at the end even though she is definitely a con artist throughout the film It s a pleasure to watch it s clear that the two have been sleeping together but any attempts by the censorship board to bring it up would have looked foolish Lubitsch s genius is how he made it appear that the censors had dirty minds A brief synopsis I wouldn t want to spoil it for you The opening shows how jewel thief Dietrich pulls off an immensely amusing heist of a pearl necklace On the run to Spain she runs into literally Gary Cooper a Detroit automobile engineer who is taking two weeks vacation in Spain before returning to the U S Of course they fall for each other but there are some nasty people after Dietrich on both sides of the law and it s up to ol Montana Gary to get the lil lady out of it
0361,Lady in White,1988,To garble Dickens There s more Spielburg than spectre in you my friend At points this reminds me of E T with ghosts instead of aliens other times it contains a rather self conscious resemblance to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD This isn t a bad film but it has a lot of potential at points almost all of which is unrealized If I sound a bit disappointed with THE LADY IN WHITE it s because I am It came with very good word of mouth more importantly it s professed aim a ghost story without gore that produced chills instead of shocks never materialized I gave up on the film being another THE HAUNTING after the first appearance of the ghost a little girl whom the main character a young boy locked in a school cloakroom after hours sees It s a basic transparency shot superimposed on the setting while I wouldn t shoot a film down wholly due to a lack of technical proficiency THE LADY IN WHITE adds to that a lack of technical imagination This film is rarely spooky it occasionally pops to the completely cute and concludes in a Close Encounters light show and as a ghost story is badly lacking However the director writer has woven in several other threads besides the spectral elements It s a mystery in that a child murderer is on the loose in the community the little girl was one of the first victims unfortunately the identity of the killer is telegraphed early into the film It also tries to be a kids eye view type of film narrated by an adult version of the boy again TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD seems to echo through the film Parts of this work especially the younger boy s relation with his older brother but the strongest element in the whole film is the racial subplot The film is based in the early sixties and the black janitor of the school is accused of being the murderer This I thought was handled very well but it s a very small part of the rest of the film and can t justify the rest My other complaint is the soundtrack also done by the writer director it s terribly overbearing throughout the film especially during the suspense scenes It s not really a bad film per se it s just not a good one The conclusion is a retread of both fantasy and suspense movie talk about dragging it out and while I liked the dated feel the film had it just wasn t enough Rate it a 2 movie if you ve got absolutely nothing to do on a fall afternoon and you should Otherwise skip it
0362,Coming to America,1988,Let me not mince words I have liked some of John Landis s films but too many have seemed like extended comedy sketches He is generally weak on characters and weaker on storyline Eddie Murphy is a standup comic who can be funny but whose films have had little of quality beyond his jokes His acting range is dwarfed even by John Wayne s Both Landis and Murphy are symbolic of what is going wrong with screen comedy The only current comedy I wanted to see less than John Landis s Eddie Murphy comedy COMING TO AMERICA was ARTHUR 2 ON THE ROCKS Then I heard that COMING TO AMERICA was supposed to be a departure for Landis and Murphy It got good reviews on television So I tried it COMING TO AMERICA is to date the high water mark for Landis s directorial career and it is the best film Eddie Murphy has ever been in Even more than BULL DURHAM it is a throwback to earlier comedies Watching it I was reminded of comedies by Lubitsch and Capra and of stories by O Henry The storyline is simple and predictable like an O Henry story but it is told with warmth Prince Akeem of Zamunda played by Murphy without a lot of smirky highjinks but with dignity and sincerity objects to the wife his father regally played by the great James Earl Jones has chosen for him Instead he decides to go to America and find someone he wants He wants someone with a mind and a will of her own who wants him for himself This ploy is a familiar one he will pretend to be a poor man and find a wife like commoners do With him he takes his faithful servant Semmi Arsenio Hall plays Semmi so well one wishes the two roles had been reversed Landis has assembled a very good cast for this story with Hall Jones Shari Headley very appealing as the woman Murphy wants to marry and John Amos as her father who runs an imitation McDonald s restaurant so close that the McDonald s corporation is going to sue him any day In addition there are a raft of minor characters who add depth and texture to the film The liberal sprinkling of minor characters is a characteristic of the good classic comedies but in recent years we see less of it because they take good writing and they take away screen time from the major stars In COMING TO AMERICA they do away with that problem by having Murphy and Hall play many of the minor characters in Rick Baker s heavy makeup Just to show I was not totally bowled over by this film I will say that there were problems with the scenes in Zamunda It should be a never never land but Zamunda seems more never never than most Perhaps my geography is bad but for a heavily forested African kingdom the vegetation seemed all wrong It is a very wealthy kingdom in which baby elephants have the big ears of African elephants but the adult elephants have the small ears of Indian elephants On top of all this the matte work to show the African palace is abominable These are definitely quibbles but they are noticeable and still I give COMING TO AMERICA a strong 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Landis and Murphy how about more of the same Oh and you will have no problem finding the reference to SEE YOU NEXT WEDNESDAY
0363,Coming to America,1988,If you are a Murphy fan definitely see this one Eddie s character is substantially tamer than usual in this new comedy romance but it was still non stop humor and action The African Palace related scenes very much reminded me of a 1940s movie like the ones Alice Faye Betty Grable and all of that crew did Remember the ones where the props were obvious facades and the landscapes obvious paintings but you didn t care because the costumes and dances were so eye catching One comment about the movie The movie is incredibly Black Sure the movie is about an African prince but the theme 99 of the cast the jokes and nearly every quality about the film seems to have been pulled out of JET or EBONY magazines I can t say if this really hurts or helps the film In fact pay attention and you will even catch a glimpse of a Black version of a famous French painting somebody help me out here the one with the French girl staring forward dressed like a maid waitress Manet or Monet There is quite a bit of background humor to watch for in this one If someone could send me a note explaining the Mortimer s money joke I d be grateful went over my head and the entire theater was clapping and cheering wildly Moderator s note The two bums were the businessmen from Murphy s earlier film TRADING PLACES Murphy does an excellent job of retaining his Eddie Murphyesque within a persona that is not his signature street wise foul mouthed wise guy His character is markedly naive to the ways in the big city this time Often I saw his BHC smile on the screen and I had anticipations of his Axel Foley character jumping out at any minute The movie s Ebony Magazine setting pokes fun of countless Black stereotype countless There is a nice pseudo insult directed at Whitney A lot of nice slams directed in the direction of McDonald s restaurants If you like any Eddie Murphy flicks at all this is a must to see but keep in mind that although he does bend his character a little here and there he is an African prince in this one
0364,Fish Called Wanda A,1988,Director Charles Chrichton Screenplay by John Cleese Produced by Michael Shamberg Starring John Cleese Jamie Lee Curtis Kevin Kline Michael Palin and Wanda Seen at USC Norris Theater July 14th This is one of those rare films that s as structurally sound as it is hilariously funny The timing characters and the absurd situations are perfect and will be appreciated by even those who don t generally care for Monty Python humor of which John Cleese and Michael Palin are co founders By the way those who do will absolutely love this movie The basic premise of four double crossing criminals trying to outsmart each other in order to find their hidden loot is well constructed and just intricate enough to be interesting without becoming unmanageable Perhaps the best part of this film is the wild and outrageous characters that Cleese has come up with Curtis and Kline both normally dramatic actors pull off comic roles like old pros and easily fit in with mainstays Cleese and Palin A true test for a great comedy it is even funnier when you think back on it afterwards and get a bigger laugh A FISH CALLED WANDA definitely fits this bill as a brilliant comedy a must see A
0365,Dead Pool The,1988,also a couple of corrections additions to the SIFF reviews at the end Moderator Before seeing THE DEAD POOL yesterday I watched the original DIRTY HARRY on CBS last Friday I enjoy that film a good deal and also MAGNUM FORCE while it s not exactly an even handed crime drama it sets the standards for a character who s gone on for a hell of a long popular run In the early Dirty Harry films San Francisco was always portrayed as a place to stay the hell away from because of those long haired crazies some of whom were homicidal maniacs you can always tell these guys because a they giggle hysterically all the time and b Harry says something pithy before slamming a bullet into their forehead And Harry s always portrayed as one of the last few bastions between Decent Folk and The Crazies and it s a thankless job I believe that some of my older relatives in Iowa got their ideas of San Francisco and California in general from Clint Eastwood movies The last couple of Harry films however have spent a lot of time parodying that image apparently not well enough though since Eastwood got elected in the Carmel mayoral race watching John Vernon ask him for advice in DIRTY HARRY becomes all the more funny Having his dog get blown away in the last film was taking the dead partner bit about as far as it would stretch and you felt as if the formula had gotten so re used that they were playing part of it for laughs Funny but I missed some of the character and eccentricities that made Harry such an interesting cop in the first movie all I can remember about the film preceding THE DEAD POOL is that Harry s tag line is Make my day It s outlasted almost all remembrances of the film itself THE DEAD POOL starts out with several efforts to get out of the rut and most of them work pretty well Harry has just put a big time gangster in San Quentin and two things have come of it One are numerous attempts on Harry s life by the gangster s associates which of course he s used to What he s NOT used to is being in the good graces of the department and the public due to his work and he has something to say about attempts by the police PR man to make him a celebrity We also have a series of murders going on among San Francisco movie people which continues to twist in the film s general news and hype theme This is all done pretty well About halfway through the film though things begin to return to the self spoofing stage though THE DEAD POOL is more subtle about it than the previous Harry films Also the city is portrayed in a less gritty manner than in some of the early films Except for kids robbing Chinese restaurants it looks like a paradise to me The ending is straight formula Harry and for that it was enjoyable but I could have asked for watching the character go somewhere MISC There s a great spoof of San Francisco chase scenes towards the end Harry s methods are still not very legal though some of them are understandable strikes me that if a guy unloads a machine gun into your car with you in it you can t be faulted too much to shooting him in the back as he runs away The romantic interest in THE DEAD POOL looks like a more elegant version of Sondra Locke I liked his new partner who can out one line Eastwood at times Basically worth 4 50 or 5 if you like Harry or limited crime dramas in general If you an informal Harry watcher wait for it to hit the discount houses Several people have pointed out two mistakes I made in the Seattle International Film Festivals I wrote First that was Kristy McNicol in TWO MOON JUNCTION not Jodie Foster Sorry it wasn t in the credits of the SIFF program and I got mixed up and put Foster s name down Lord knows why I would get the two mixed up Anyway it s a stupid movie you still don t want to see it Secondly in the Hollywood and the Code retrospective of BORN TO BE BAD I mistakenly put down Henry Travers as the obnoxious child actor who played Loretta Young s kid Several people pointed out that Travers was a older pleasant character actor who was a Hollywood staple these days he s best known as Clarence the Angel in IT S A WONDERFUL LIFE I got the name mixed up I forgot that in the thirties child actors got much lower billing than they do nowadays unless their name was Shirley Temple and since Travers was listed below Grant s name I expected that was the kid s name he s on screen a lot Travers plays a kindly old bookstore owner who is always trying to keep Loretta Young on the path of virtue Good luck One last addendum to the festival The Market Theater which closed down a few weeks ago has been picked up by the Cineplex Odeon chain of theaters and is currently showing DOMINICK AND EUGENE I can only hope that since DOMINICK AND EUGENE is the kind of film the Market always enjoyed showing that Ann Browder and company are still in charge and maybe just maybe they can wangle Cineplex Odeon into using the Market for next year s festival
0366,Die Hard,1988,Well looks like DIE HARD made it out before A FISH CALLED WANDA I have no doubt in my mind these will be two of the most remembered movies shown in national movie theatre chains this summer ROGER RABBIT being the third probably but who can tell Thumbs up from me and my friends although I must say it s probably going to be far more impressive if you see it in 70mm so you get the bigger than life feel and the big sound of course It was impressive Still this one should hold its own in normal movie theatres as well Bruce Willis The man is an enigma No He is a jerk Or used to be He started off really hot in MOONLIGHTING and kind of sputtered out We won t even mention debacles like THE RETURN OF BRUNO and so forth However in DIE HARD the director probably said Don t be doing Seagram s Wine Cooler acting in here or you re outta this flick Must ve been a convincing director In my mind and I ll bet the rest of you will feel the same as well Willis does a damned convincing job The character in which he is cast feels pain and goes through it for the people depending on him and coincidentally for the audience You can even feel for him In certain places the acting seems a bit contrived as in when he seems to be going crazy going what ll I do a bit pushed Other places few as they were were annoying with the wonderful one liner Yippee ki ay m therf cker However as a whole he does a damned convincing job in his role Which is this John McClain is a NYPD cop either accidentally invited to an office Xmas bash in LA or he has gone out there to visit his separated wife and kids or both I m still unclear on this it ll come to me As he enters the office tower where the party is going on cutting out the first 15 minute hullaballoo an ingenious subplot is unfolding a crafty incredibly knowledgeable team of experts want to get their hands on a lot of valuable goodies locked inside a very tricky safe inside this building I won t relay more detail because many of you probably have not seen this movie yet In short the team seals off the building from the inside effecting a hostage situation It s McLain s Willis job to get the people out in one piece among other things I ve said too much already go see it It s a another must this summer It seems to be a little too high on action seems to be something happening every minute after the first 20 which is probably why the few people who were somehow bored with this movie didn t leave I d guess 3 out of a theatre of 1 000 or so The slow motion cliffhanger sequence sky scraper hanger near the end was extremely well done in my opinion Shhh Ok ok The amount of enforcer help summoned near the end seems a bit ludicrous to me as do the FBI agents attitudes It has a fairly talented cast not too many faces I recognized but the main baddie has a face from somewhere I am sure and is very cold and very calculating a perfect villain especially considering what he was supposed to be portraying And one of his cronies is that guy with the wonderfully stormy good word face that was also the conductor in MONEY PIT an amusing but strange comedy to see at 4AM I forget his name I am almost 100 positive he is Germanic But he is wonderful The end bit was a little cough HA hard to believe but I remember now Alexander Godunov He also co starred in WITNESS tri starred 4 starred
0367,Midnight Run,1988,The other day I rented Brian DePalma s 1986 organized crime comedy WISE GUYS It was worse than this DePalma fan thought a DePalma film could be So it was with some trepidation that I went to see yet another Mafia style buddy film MIDNIGHT RUN Perhaps the contrast accounts for why I so thoroughly enjoyed the latter There is nothing particularly new about pitting two opposites against each other having a cross country chase or dodging the FBI and the mob MIDNIGHT RUN transcends the formula with a well crafted script and terrific acting on the parts of the lead characters I was never a big fan of Charles Grodin until I saw him hold his own with Robert DeNiro The chemistry between these two actors really works and they are so compelling that they practically carry the film Fortunately they are backed up by a fine supporting cast featuring some of the dumbest and meanest mobsters ever with Dennis Farina as the latter Yaphet Koto gets in some good licks as the harried FBI special agent Martin Brest also gets credit for his taught direction This film is a real balancing act between comedy drama and action picture Just when things might tip too far in one direction everything comes swinging back And as Steve Upstill pointed out at the theatre there are at least four times during the film where you ask yourself How on earth will they get out of this one As outlandish as the answer often is the film works well enough to let you willingly suspend disbelief MIDNIGHT RUN is certainly worth seeing and it s actually worth seeing on the big screen the better to appreciate Rob Hahn s fine camera operation
0368,Midnight Run,1988,High Concept Picture this The Odd Couple in a cops and robbers chase movie Well maybe not the original Odd Couple but you have the slob and the high strung neurotic The slob is a bounty hunter who smokes eats greasy food cusses that sort of thing He s got to bring the accountant of a Las Vegas gangster and heroin dealer from New York to Los Angeles Any of these odd couple movies work on the principle that if you get to know somebody even of a very different type whom you start out hating you of course get to like the other guy as you get to know him The odd couple plot has already been done at least once on the road with last year s PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES MIDNIGHT RUN has its own odd couple as well as its own planes trains and automobiles Bounty hunter Jack Walsh played by Robert DeNiro having the time of his life has got to get Jonathan Mardukas played by Charles Grodin from New York to Los Angeles On the up side he will get 100 000 just for bringing one guy in On the down side 1 he cannot stand Mardukas 2 Mardukas is too neurotic to fly the distance so they have to go by ground transport 3 the FBI wants to stop them because they want to bring Mardukas in 4 another bounty hunter wants to stop them because he wants to bring Mardukas in and 5 the Mob would like to stop them not just because they do not want Mardukas to tell what he knows but also because he embezzled 15 000 000 from them All this is just a quaint way of saying that Walsh s chances of getting Mardukas to L A are less than ideal and that this particular trip is across country will not be uneventful The two leads of MIDNIGHT RUN are clever and funny men Charles Grodin has a reputation for being in real life one of the funniest and wittiest men in filmmaking but he just cannot project it from the wide screen Or perhaps he is just being himself on screen while other actors turn up the clowning switch to high while the cameras roll He comes off not so much funny as witty and likable in MIDNIGHT RUN DeNiro can be funny but somehow the chemistry between the two men never really works MIDNIGHT RUN is often funny has a lot of action and some semi obligatory car chases and is in general an okay piece of entertainment Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0369,Big Top Pee-wee,1988,SYNOPSIS WINGS OF DESIRE is a recent film in which an angel falls in love with a circus trapeze artist BIG TOP PEE WEE is a recent film in which Pee Wee Herman falls in love with a circus trapeze artist The two films have many other surprising similarities in common as this review makes clear Neither film in this reviewer s opinion lives up to its potential ASIDE The credits for BIG TOP PEE WEE listed a Key Gizmo Man Is this an established job on a film set What does he do REVIEW Cinema today has occasionally been compared to religion moving pictures are essentially icons or likenesses taken on faith requiring some suspension of belief in the nature of everyday reality and perhaps needing additional imagination on the part of observers to fill in the lacunae of the presented visions For this reason many film critics find particular interest in films which touch on spiritual matters One film which I saw recently seemed to center upon the rite of passage of a spiritual being and his earthy fascination with an aerial artiste a trapeze performer in a circus The opening moments of the film are moody and powerful as it becomes apparent that only small children can truly perceive the nature or even presence of the protagonist himself happiest when flying or leaving the constraints of this mortal coil to appear far overhead But will his infatuation with a circus showgirl prove to be a meretricious liason resolving her into his Nemesis Is a consideration of this eternal question perhaps the Angst which eats out the soul of which Fassbinder so fearfully cautioned us As enigmatic as Resnais s L ANNEE DERNIERE A MARIENBAD the French translation is tantalizingly imprecise as to whether derniere is last in the sense of final or rather previous this film can perhaps best be interpreted as an endorsement of Wittgenstein s fundamental philosophy later repudiated that the correspondence between elementary propositions and real facts Wittgenstein s Sachverhalt can only be inaccurately pictured in language but not stated for this would require an extra linguistic medium for expression Hence Wittgenstein erroneously reasoned all philosophy attempts to say the unsayable and true to the consequences of this belief he gave up his professorship and became a porter in an English hospital If only the film director had followed this example Others more charitable would suggest that a more accurate simile for this cinematic woman inspired evolution of the child visible free spirit would be Bogart s definitive transformation of Charlie Allnutt Bogart s only Oscar was awarded for this portrayal from intrepid but uncaring observer into involved hero of courage perseverance and devotion in THE AFRICAN QUEEN The brooding concentration as an idiosyncratic hero follows an elegiac path from a world beyond conventional experience into the physical confinements of the human condition works on a plethora of levels and effortlessly conveys a deep but ultimately unsatisfying sense of fantasy fulfilment which mars both of these films Echoing Brecht s famous theory of alienation the scene which worked best for me was the one in which the earthbound lover slowly twirled the vertical rope on which the aerial object of his affections was posing Bertolt Brecht strongly believed in avoiding the creation of illusion so that the audience was not emotionally manipulated but remained capable of intelligent appraisal Shunning past transparencies the hero of this film is now definitely earthbound while the heroine glides easily over his head in a clever but not wholly unanticipated inversion of their prior stations both have given up much but the union of both together achieves more Brecht s thesis on this occasion is vindicated ironically enough by the garish showmanship of a circus act Bazin founder of the seminal CAHIERS DU CINEMA held that a film maker should be considered in the light of thematic consistency and development throughout his work On these terms this film can only be regarded as a disappointing regression from previously promising though inconsistent earlier works I d like to end these pensees with a real kick ass power metaphor but it s Saturday night and my intellect is throbbing in a way that nothing short of a few swift bevies with the bitchin babes at the local brewhouse will allay Also it s my turn to argue whether Being and Nothingness is a correct translation of Sartre s Etre et le Neant so I gotta scoot Later dudes
0370,Big Top Pee-wee,1988,Pee Wee Herman had a farm E I E I O Pee Wee now lives on a farm and takes care of several animals including a talking pig named Vance He is engaged to the local school teacher a pretty virginal blonde who loves egg salad When the circus lands in Pee Wee s back yard he is quickly adopted by the circus people Pee Wee falls in love with the beautiful Trapeze Girl and has to decide between the school teacher and her Being a big Pee Wee fan I ve been anxiously waiting for the release of his new movie Unfortunately I was disappointed maybe I expected so much more The first 30 to 40 minutes of the film is by far the best these are scenes where Pee Wee deals his everyday life the farm the farm animals the townfolks his fiancee etc The scenes work because the focus is on Pee Wee it s when the film breaks away to the circus people and their problems that it loses interest Pee Wee s comedies always seems to work when he surrounds himself with characters sillier and more absurd than himself in doing this we the audience can relate to him and discover our own peculiarities In BIG TOP PEE WEE he breaks away from this formula too much and as a result the audience looses interest Kris Kristofferson sic plays his scenes so straight that Pee Wee has trouble playing off him it doesn t appear to be any chemistry between Pee Wee and the other characters In PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE every character was so absurd and exaggerated that Pee Wee seemed normal The ending of Big Top Pee Wee bothered me the most It appeared that the editor left out about 15 minutes of story The entire film builds up to the big night of the circus and nothing happens the film ends without a climax I would have loved to have seen Pee Wee caught up in several circus acts it would have been the opportunity for some great slapstick On a scale from 1 to 10 1 being a piece of shit and 10 being absolutely fantsatic I give it a 7 I must admit being a big fan of Pee Wee I m biased however I did expect the film to be as good or better than his first film PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE LEE
0371,Fish Called Wanda A,1988,A local theater previewed A FISH CALLED WANDA last weekend A FISH CALLED WANDA is an awkward title for a very funny film John Cleese who wrote and stars in but does not direct this film is back on form If you like zany comedies then you ll love this Some of Cleese s earlier solo films were patchy PRIVATES ON PARADE and some were downright boring CLOCKWISE but here we see sustained clever inventive comedy It simply gleams with wit The story line is straightforward based on a gang of double crossing jewel thieves after a successful raid The story is set in London and it s a pleasure to see the care taken with the location shooting apart from the final shot of the speeding car heading from the Old Bailey to Heathrow why are you going via Oxford John Some of the film editing is a bit clumsy too how does Michael Palin end up on the luggage conveyor at the airport Kevin Kline is superb as the ex CIA hitman sneering at the Brits The audience broke into spontaneous applause at the end of this film and you don t hear that very often these days A FISH CALLED WANDA is funny contains sharp characterizations and deserves to be an extraordinary success
0372,Midnight Run,1988,Friday mornings are tough enough to wake up to however I have a few habits which have made the process easier to bear in my twilight years I get up at 6 45 tune the radio to NPR and twist the volume up a couple of notches Then I tramp into the shower and wash in a slow motion manner while my stupor begins to melt About the time coherent thoughts are possible Tom Shale TV critic for the WASHINGTON POST is on doing one of his guerrilla film reviews and that brings me usually chuckling to consciousness While Shales and I don t always agree I like films that he hates he s so cutting and inventively nasty that he s fun to listen to opinion regardless So imagine my surprise upon hearing Shales voice boisterously praising a new film as my senses begin to function After checking that there wasn t any shampoo in my ears I struggled to hear the name of the film Shales actually liking a film all the way through What freak of nature had caused this hiccup in the law of averages Some new Dutch wunderkind with a film on lovers during the Falklands war Well no it s an action comedy picture By the guys who did BEVERLY HILLS COP no less MIDNIGHT RUN with De Niro and Grodin While struggling into my rather wrinkled chinos and rugby shirt I made a mental note to catch the film that weekend and see if Shales had his shit together He does There have been so many unsuccessful buddy buddy action films of late that it s easy to be cynical about the whole schtick These movies usually walk too far on one side or the other of the the action comedy partition too funny to be real or else the comedy is plastered on with a trowel hardly meshing to the plot at all MIDNIGHT RUN doesn t have that problem suspense is not a put on to the audience and the comedy is based almost entirely on the relations between a series of major and minor characters This film is like some molecular model everything that happens results from various supporting characters bouncing into the two main characters De Niro and Grodin who are themselves chained together often literally by their circumstances MIDNIGHT RUN walks the razor blade of a genre film and pulls it off completely due to the skill of the people involved Robert De Niro is an ex cop who works as a bounty hunter in L A He wants to make one final midnight run that ll pay big so he can buy a coffee shop He s got scruples and rules that few bounty hunters and as it turns out few cops have A sleazy local bail bondsman wants him to find and bring back to LA a mob accountant who skipped bail Charles Grodin he needs to be back in five days Unfortunately for De Niro a lot of other people want Grodin the mob because Grodin stole millions from them and gave it to charity the feds so that Grodin can testify headed by Yaphet Kotto in his best role in years and a bungling bounty hunter brought in when the bondsmen gets worried about De Niro s chances After finding Grodin in New York De Niro begins a cross country trek with his prisoner who both gnaws and ultimately grows on him And at every step of the trip they find themselves running into or from the supporting characters It almost becomes a ritual but it gets funnier each time it happens and it never slows down This film has all the bubble and bite and I m not handicapping it any of a Preston Sturges film at his best and I can t think of a much better compliment than that The story holds up perfectly everything happens for a good reason and hardly anything is telegraphed unless it s intentionally to divert the viewer in another direction The conclusion is especially good and I walked out vowing to see this again in a couple of weeks I m looking forward to it too De Niro plays his role with the hundreds of quirks he puts into any of his character physically and emotionally he can be a clown but he never mugs for the camera and his character is full blooded This isn t ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA but he doesn t put anything less into it Charles Grodin is just as good but his watchword is control He could have played this like Tony Randall in a broadly neurotic TV style eccentric Here however he is restrained and gets his laughs from his low key snipes at just the right times and in the right tone of voice And he also ends up with a character who is as three dimensional as De Niro s it turns out that both their characters believe in certain rules and sticking to them and both of them do and you end up admiring them for it The other actors are all all top notch As I said Kotto has a slow burn in this film that Edgar Kennedy could envy The two mob underlings after Grodin are hilarious their obvious affection for one another one is former pug and neither is too bright is another of those bright touches that litter this film Dennis Farina of the late unlamented Crime Story on TV plays a mob boss with the kind of vicious conviction that breaks through that kind of role And Melvin the bumbling class B bounty hunter who competes for Grodin with De Niro carries out a running gag there are lots of running gags in this film and all of them are good with the best of the slapstick fall guys These guys are all archetypes not stereotypes they start from the standard character type and go on from there fleshing themselves out with each movement and sentence The writer for MIDNIGHT RUN George Gallo had these people pinned down in his head and with director Martin Brest he brings each to the forefront Along with BIG one of the best comedies in the last two years Worth every penny of 5 and then some
0373,Die Hard,1988,Well it starts out with Bruce Willis taciturn New York cop in his wife s LA office in expensive high rise office tower housing big executive Christmas party He s in his undershirt making fists with his toes in the carpet like any white male during the holiday season But wait What s this Big black trucks with ominous music heading for the Century City tower Guys with Germanic accents A terrorist who looks like Huey Lewis Explosions A younger clone of David Warner Surface to surface missiles Dumb Feds Smart street cops The dickless guy from GHOSTBUSTERS being dickless again Lots of fashionable swearing Actually DIE HARD is pretty entertaining It s like a two hour plus MISSION IMPOSSIBLE episode livened a bit by good action photography a decent score except for a one minute excerpt of James Horner s Marching Klingon music at the end Willis conversations with an LA street cop and a limo driver and competent attention to detail throughout except for the conclusion which sacrifices a lot of logic to provide domestic bliss and one last thrill It s popcorn entertainment at it s very best i e plastic thin but will keep you happy for the duration 70mm and Dolby stereo help a LOT The thing that separates melodrama from drama is how well written the characters are and if it s acted how good are the performances In TRAVELLING NORTH the answers are respectively good and very good Leo McKern plays a retiring civil engineer in his seventies who retires to the northern shore of Australia with women who is younger than him by a decade or two McKern is a grouchy old socialist who can be quite a tyrant with his new companion and his neighbors What s more his health begins failing him and his SO is torn between staying with him in an almost servile capacity as his health fails and his temperament gets worse and visiting her daughters from a previous marriage living in Perth who are having their own problems The film deals with intelligent people having a relationship in their twilight years and all in all it does it quite well The dialogue is fine understated and is never over dramatic McKern puts in a very fine non Rumpole performance and his fellow actors and actresses put in an honest day s work I came out of TRAVELLING NORTH strangely refreshed it s not a big film in any sense but it is a quietly satisfying one All I can say is that this is comic genius to watch Tom Hanks play a thirteen year old in a man s body The credit shouldn t go to Hanks alone of course the script and the direction by Penny Marshall give out for no more than four or five minutes in the entire film and the whole principle twist of the film that a boy of thirteen can prosper by seeing the world in his adolescent terms is carried out beautifully rather like a variation of Peter Sellers Chauncey Gardner s trip through high society What s more Marshall and Hank s constantly underline how much of the adult world of business inherits the foibles of the child s playground The theme is constantly spotlighted but always in a way clever enough not to breed familiarity and thus contempt And there are some beautiful bits here the first check the meeting on the building transformer and the decoration of Hank s apartment The cocktail party scene should definitely be remembered come Oscar time if only for the corn and caviar jokes Enough verbiage I laughed my ass off through this film and the audience gave applauded it at the end pretty good for a film in its eighth or ninth week
0374,Dead Pool The,1988,Capsule review There is a slightly lighter touch to the new Dirty Harry film but otherwise it is the strict Dirty Harry formula including lots of action and impossible escapes Eastwood takes potshots at the bad guys TV news and horror movies Rating 1 Dirty Harry is back in THE DEAD POOL I don t have to tell you what kind of film it is There just isn t a whole lot of variation from one Dirty Harry film to the next There are car chases there are explosions there is a violent murderer there are machine gunnings Hey an aside here At one point thugs go after Harry with machine guns When the machine guns hit a car door they make a nice regular perforation when they hit a windshield they make holes in a random pattern as if from single shot guns and even with a machine gun the thugs can t seem to hit Harry They swiss cheese his car and Harry steps out without a scratch I guess that too is a hallmark of a Dirty Harry film In fact the only thing really new is the jokes And one of the best of these is borrowed from from GARDENS OF STONE This time around the plot involves a convicted Mafioso who has it in for Harry an attractive TV news reporter and the murder of a rock star on the set of the new ripoff film of a cult horror film director uh he calls it an homage Before it is over the film will take pot shots at the invulnerability of Mafiosi and the standards of TV news reporting but it will save its biggest salvo for how nasty and violent horror films are I am sure that Mr Eastwood sensitive soul that he is would never allow violence to creep into one of his films We also see three people blown up in explosions two people carved with knives and one extremely hypocritical actor playing the lead It is good to see Evan C Kim getting a major role as Harry s new partner Kim did a hilarious imitation of Bruce Lee in KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and in the interim I remember him only in HOLLYWOOD VICE SQUAD Beyond that there is some creativity in THE DEAD POOL including the only car chase I have really enjoyed since FOUL PLAY in spite of the fact that it makes little sense some wildly improbable escapes for Harry and a new mean line to replace Make my day All in all it is a new Dirty Harry film even if that is an oxymoron Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0375,Fish Called Wanda A,1988,Capsule review Very funny well written crime story comedy combines the story telling of the old Ealing comedies with the pace and outrageousness of FAWLTY TOWERS This film makes one long for the days of better films by better writers We don t see many like this any more Rating high 2 I got complaints recently on my review of MIDNIGHT RUN I only mildly liked a comedy adventure in which you got to know somewhat two conflicting character types set on the background of a sort of race across country that included cars chasing cars helicopters cars and double crosses Now eight days later I see an English comedy adventure A FISH CALLED WANDA It too has chases conflicting personalities and double crosses but the poor British cannot afford to blow up helicopters and crash cars so they economize by getting good writers who can really write dialogue and create characters and at the same time be funny and tell a good story that keeps an audience guessing how things are all going to turn out In short A FISH CALLED WANDA is not only a film that does things right it is a film that does some things astoundingly right The film begins with a mismatched set of crooks pulling off a jewel heist There are two English brothers played by Michael Palin and Tom Georgeson and an American brother and sister Otto and Wanda played by Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis The jewels are just barely stowed away when the first double cross happens The second double cross is only a short time after One double cross might have caused problems with two all hell breaks loose in an amazing set of misunderstandings dirty tricks counter plots and revenges Soon into the fray comes barrister Archie Leach does that name sound familiar played by John Cleese Wanda wants to use Leach against the English brothers but Otto s basic anti British prejudice starts fouling things up A FISH CALLED WANDA was written by John Cleese and directed by Charles Crichton who directed great British comedies like THE LAVENDER HILL MOB It was based on a story by Cleese Crichton With that background it is not surprising that it has a feel of FAWLTY TOWERS combined with MONTY PYTHON crossed with old Ealing Studios comedy A FISH CALLED WANDA has good three dimensional characters has a good story and is very funny at the same time Rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0376,Blob The,1988,When the original BLOB came out in 1958 it was a film that was in some respects ahead of its time Not that it was a virtue but it was one of the first science fiction films that put teenagers not only at the forefront as the main characters but also made them the clearest thinkers of the film a device to cater to a recognized teenaged audience even then Also the film was made by an independent production company but released by a major in this case Paramount a practice more common today than in the 1950s One thing that was not 1980 ish about THE BLOB was the special effects At that time most often special effects were expected only to help tell the story not to be visually believable necessarily much in the way that little is really visually believable in a marionette show So like many of the science fiction films made when science fiction films were hitting their stride but special effects had not yet hit theirs THE BLOB is getting a nominal remake in the special effects conscious 1980s I say a nominal remake because there are some major twists to the story not in the original film Perhaps Jack Harris who produced the original and co produced the remake felt that the original story was a little slow and simplistic for modern audiences However the major innovation is one that has been done many enough times that a straighter remake would have made for a more original film overall Many of the incidents of the original film occur in the remake but in different ways Shawnee Smith plays Meg Penny who has seen what the amorphous alien can do but nobody believes her The police look at the mostly consumed body of one of the victims and assume absurdly enough that it is local rebel Brian Flag played by Kevin Dillon who killed and ate the unfortunate after a disagreement between the two I assume some sort of congratulations should go to screenwriters Chuck Russell who also directed and Frank Darabont for figuring ways to take the plot of a 30 year old film and fill it with 1 motor vehicle chases 2 sex 3 another retread of the condom buying scene from SUMMER OF 42 4 heavy armaments 5 an anti government social statement 6 whiz bang special effects and 7 rock music And whiz bang special effects they are The original shapeless glop from outer space did little but roll The new incarnation also shakes and rattles It does all kinds of disgusting gooey things that seem to have been inspired by the effects of John Carpenter s THING Also the filmmakers of the new BLOB know how to create some atmospheric photographic effects So which is the better film Well if they are seen back to back which effectively I did I would say that the original pales next to the remake That only proves that the remake would have been a memorable film in the 1950s if it had not been banned for what then would have seemed like too much sex and totally absurd levels of violence But the original will remain the classic because it stood out from the pack The remake is just one more of the same kind of film Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0377,Tucker: The Man and His Dream,1988,Capsule review Francis Ford Coppola and Lucasfilm in top form bring to the screen the story of automotive legend Preston Tucker The film is a tribute to American creativity and a lament about a system that wastes genius Jeff Bridges refreshingly plays that increasingly rare hero of the screen a man of genius Rating 3 Okay I admit it I like stories about engineers and engineering feats My favorite war film is probably DAM BUSTERS I liked THE RIGHT STUFF a lot even if it in some ways trivialized the space program I like tributes to intelligence and ingenuity particularly if the ingenuity is in something other than a better way to clout someone on the head or drive a car in a car chase It is about time filmmakers recognized that some audiences respect and have interest in other talents than those perhaps some skills that can t be tested in a video game The problem is that videogame skills are easy to make exciting on a screen Intelligence drive and vision really require a good script Francis Ford Coppola s TUCKER The Man and His Dream has a good script It is the first film I have seen since THE RIGHT STUFF that has a hero I would call heroic Part of the reason is that both films are about true pieces of history but also that both portray a sort of American engineering optimism of the 1940s and 1950s that seems to be very rare today TUCKER is the biography of Preston Tucker enthusiastically played by Jeff bridges who had visions of creating a car of superior design but who was brought down by the system in a true story that could have come from an Ayn Rand novel It shows the design and the building of the Tucker a futuristic car that the entrepreneur wanted to build in the years following World War II This film is the anecdotal story of how Tucker assembled a design team financed the project acquired a factory and sold the idea of the car to the public and finally of the events that led to Tucker s name not becoming a household word A film about creativity should be creative and TUCKER is in a lot of different ways The film starts out as a public relations film for the Tucker Motor Company and with no discernible boundaries segues into the real story of the film Particularly creative are the ways in which the film visualizes telephone conversations And even with the creative photography TUCKER creates a period feel And speaking of imaginative things never done before Coppola manages to turn Martin Landau s character Abe into someone likable and sympathetic With the exception of an abortive effect during the second season of SPACE 1999 no one has ever tried much less succeeded at making this wooden actor seem likable Landau even looks the part or at least the type something done by no one else major in this film as Coppola seems intentionally to tell the audience No matter his characters embody a spirit that transcends physical resemblance Also occasionally they say things that are intended more for 1988 ears but always to make a point well taken
0378,Someone to Love,1987,Cast Orson Welles Henry Jaglom Andrea Marcovicci Michael Emil Sally Kellerman Oja Kodar Stephen Bishop Dave Frishberg Geraldine Baron Ronee Blakely Barbara Flood Pamela Goldblum Robert Hallak Kathryn Harrold Monte Hellman Jeremy Kagan Michael Kaye Miles Kreuger Amnon Meskin Sunny Meyer Peter Rafelson Ora Rubens Katherine Wallach Credits Written and Directed by Henry Jaglom Produced by M H Simonsons Associate Producer Judith Wolinksky Director of Photography Hanania Baer Sound Sunny Meyer Assistant Editor Ruth Wald Songs by Diane Bulgarelli Stephen Bishop Dave Frishberg and Jerome Kern Ira Gershwin Henry Jaglom has remained outside the Hollywood mainstream for more than a decade and a half and he s quite proud of his role as a maverick A close friend of Orson Welles Jaglom has written and directed seven films since 1970 each costing less than 1 million He has insisted on total artistic control over them all looking inward for the source material of his films For example his 1985 film ALWAYS examined his divorce from actress Patrice Townsend and was shot entirely in the house they had shared Whenever a filmmaker and artists in general focus on themselves in this manner they typically find themselves accused of wallowing in self indulgence This sort of criticism doesn t faze Jaglom To get something of universal value Jaglom said in a telephone conversation you have to focus on one specific issue rather than appealing to the lowest common denominator Of course the issue Jaglom is most familiar with is himself He has creatively used his independence once again in SOMEONE TO LOVE In it he raises the question of why people are lonely especially on that most romantic of holidays Valentine s Day Of course Jaglom is a filmmaker and not a sociologist or philosopher and so he doesn t have any real answers to this profoundly human question Given that reality Jaglom said that he knew from the start that I would paint myself into a corner Therefore Jaglom asked Orson Welles to put things in historical perspective and to impart his considerable wisdom and experience not only in filmic matters but in the tricky ground of love and interpersonal relationships The film begins appropriately enough with a few choice words from Welles Then it quickly shifts to Danny Jaglom and Helen Andrea Marcovicci with whom Jaglom has spent most of the past five years with in real life getting ready to go to sleep Helen who has just gotten used to sleeping alone after the painful breakup of her previous relationship tells Danny that she won t be able to go to sleep if he remains inside her house This arouses Danny s curiosity and he sends out telegrams to his show business friends to gather on Valentine s Day at a beautiful theater in Santa Monica the Mayfair Theater that is about to be replaced by a shopping mall Danny a filmmaker figures that he might get some interesting footage and at the very least he will be able to introduce his brother Mickey Michael Emil Jaglom s brother in real life to some romantic companions When Valentine s Day arrives Danny s friends arrive expecting a party but find themselves talking about themselves and their loneliness into the handheld Arriflex cameras run by the film crew Danny has brought along One soon realizes that all the actors in Danny s film are in fact thinly disguised versions of the actors in Jaglom s film And Danny the filmmaker is really Jaglom the filmmaker while Welles listed as Danny s Friend in the credits is of course himself These dichotomies becomes more and more unified as the film goes on until it is nearly impossible to distinguish between actor and character This sort of interview filmmaking can be traced to the Brechtian and Godardian technique of having actors interrupt the narrative flow to comment on their perceptions of what their character is doing and why And indeed Jaglom cites as his primary influences the great filmmakers of the 1960s Bergman Fellini Godard Truffaut Although the film has a somewhat documentary feel to it Jaglom says he has not been influenced by the cinema verite movement as epitomized by Frederick Wiseman Instead he likes the label that some critics have given his works emotional verite Given the close relationship between Danny s film and Jaglom s film one can t help but wonder how SOMEONE TO LOVE was constructed Did Jaglom notify his actors about his plans Or did he pull a trick similar to the one Danny pulls for his film In reply Jaglom simply says that SOMEONE TO LOVE reflects his general filmmaking technique He mentions that he scripts thorough guidelines for his actors but lets the actors fill in the actual phrasing of dialogue Jaglom says that he likes to go with the emotion that s going on during the shoot When shooting is complete Jaglom retreats to the editing room for several months where he reinvents the film melding the disparate elements into an evolving whole The result of this process doesn t always seem to work and indeed SOMEONE TO LOVE is more interesting for Jaglom s and Welles ideas on filmmaking than as illumination on romance Jaglom s favorite quotation is one from Orson Welles The enemy of art is the absence of limitations In principle this is entirely accurate the great film artists are the ones who have transcended barriers both human and technical to arrive at new forms of expression of their ideas Many of these great filmmakers especially those hampered by official condemnation or censorship have had to struggle mightily for the opportunity to create their art In Jaglom s case however the barriers he overcomes are not intrinsic ones to the medium of film By definition film is a technological art form and Jaglom will be the first to admit he has done nothing to advance the technical state of filmic art Asked why he then employs the medium of film instead of say books or stage plays Jaglom replies that he prefers the basic tools of the cinema because they give him access to closeups sound manipulations and editing Jaglom says he decided not to use television or video which offer similar advantages because cinema has a different feel at least for now He stresses that for him as opposed to Spielberg or Lucas technology must always be used to stimulate minds about humans and humanity Even on the human side though it s not that easy to identify or relate to Danny who seems to have swallowed completely the veneer of dazzling romance put forth by countless Hollywood movies When Helen reminds Danny that Not everyone wants a picket fence you know Danny replies Well everyone should without bothering to give a reason why everyone should feel that way Given that most real life relationships don t even come close to enjoying the grandeur on display in most movie romances it s no wonder that Danny feels something is wrong Danny though doesn t seem able to trace his problem back to his premise and he just sticks microphones in people s faces and continues asking questions looking more and more foolish as he goes along But this usual sort of criticism is misplaced here because Jaglom is quite consciously portraying Danny as a lovable buffoon It has almost become a Jaglom trademark for his character to simultaneously be a protagonist and an anti egotist As mentioned above Jaglom knew from the beginning that his project would not work without Welles It takes Danny a bit longer to come to the same conclusion while shooting his film Finally around the end of the fourth reel Danny throws his hands up in the air and mutters It s not going to work It doesn t work And that s when Danny Jaglom bring Welles in again to offer his wisdom Viewers may condemn Jaglom for self indulgence but no one can possibly accuse him of being arrogant or self serving By playing a filmmaker making a film which is essentially the same film that viewers are seeing Jaglom succeeds on two fronts First he manages to raise some basic questions about people as simple living human beings Second he then steps back and encourages the characters in the film as well as the members of the audience itself to ponder and think for themselves what appropriate responses there may be to Jaglom s questions Because there is no bearded saint dispensing wisdom from a mountaintop in this film Welles doesn t count despite the fact that he is indeed bearded and wearing a long flowing wine colored robe he can only gently guide viewers with his advice because he too doesn t have any magic answers there is no hope of being spoon fed with ready made solutions The actors and actresses in Danny s film rise to the challenge they think for themselves about loneliness and pour forth a rush of diverse answers as diverse as the actors themselves What emerges of value is not only the specific answers in addition it is the emotional and intellectual processes by which Danny s friends derive their answers that is also important Danny Jaglom has recognized perhaps subconsciously that methods often get lost in the perpetual craving for predigested results and it is exactly that realization which SOMEONE TO LOVE is trying to convey to its viewers at least to the viewers who remain until the end This sort of reflexive filmmaking is rare of course and it certainly is removed from the common assumptions of conventional cinema Only two films in recent memory have similarly linked filmmakers actors and viewers together one being GIRLTALK and the other a 14 1 2 hour marathon on nuclear war called THE JOURNEY This separation from the mainstream is hardly a weakness Rather it emphasizes and affirms that Jaglom is one of the endangered species of American cinema He is a serious and dedicated film artist who refuses to pander to the box office and he has consistently declined offers to direct big budget films in order to persevere and preserve his integrity His themes are by no means revolutionary and his simple cinematic style couldn t be more different from the highly technical art of Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 1968 But Jaglom has adopted these and other filmmakers visionary outlook on the potentials of filmic art and turned it inward to make highly personal and intimately human films Like the actors and actresses in Danny s film viewers and up and coming filmmakers would do well to experience the subtle methodology underlying and enriching Jaglom s SOMEONE TO LOVE Directorial filmography of Henry Jaglom Orson Welles once said that Henry Jaglom s films have no cute little space creatures no chases no rapes no murders And it s true His latest film NEW YEAR S DAY will be released this coming winter Currently he is shooting a film in Los Angeles called EATING which will focus on women and their obsessions with food He has also recently established the Women s Film Company as a subsidiary of his International Rainbow Pictures to produce low budget hopefully high quality human stories by women directors
0379,Last Temptation of Christ The,1988,This review is posted here because it is a review of the film While it does cover a lot of the controversy regarding THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST it does it in the context of the film itself Opposing reviews are of course welcome Siskel and Ebert both panned the film for example but they must be reviews and based on the author s opinion of the film after viewing it him herself Moderator Well due to all the controversy surrounding THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST I went to see just what the furor was about on opening Friday night I arrived at the CinePlex theatres in Century City a little after 8 00 hoping that perhaps the 9 00 show wasn t yet sold out Only show for which they still had tickets 12 00 midnight Okay I didn t have much else to do so I bought a ticket for midnight In the meantime I wandered around checking out the protest activity It appeared that at any given time there was about 1 3 part protesters and 2 3 moviegoers outside the theatre so there was no shortage of activity hundreds of people milling around etc During the entire time waiting around moviegoers were subjected to quite a bit of entertainment in the form of lots of imaginative protest signs Holy Word not Hollywood The Greatest Story Ever Distorted Don t Rewrite His Story etc About half were preprinted and the other half were homemade Included were a very few protesters with signs for the other side all handmade I thanked a couple of those for getting out and standing up for Marty s rights to make such a movie There was one identifiable organized group mixed in with the protesters ranks the TFP who seemed to be made up of a very few well dressed gents with big red sashes and perhaps a few helpers and had most of the area directly in front of the theatre complex staked out where their audience was not so much the waiting theatergoers but the automobile traffic out front They had a great color flyer entitled Blasphemy and a coupon to send away for more flyers or just send money to their cause They didn t stick it out as long as the more generic protesters they were gone by the time I got in line for the last show about 10 45 Their statement of who they are on the back of their flyer was kind of interesting The American Society for the Defense of Tradition Family and Property TFP is a civic and cultural organization Its doctrinal inspiration is entirely Catholic and its goal is to preserve our country and Christian civilization from the ideological offensive revolutionary psychological warfare promoted incessantly inside all the countries of the West by insidious Communist propaganda The bulk of the protesters were there until we went in which ended up being close to 1 00 due to protest induced delays and no one was around at 4 00 when we got out The newsmedia was there for a couple of hours but didn t seem to be getting much of any use out of the scene any time the lights went on the protesters immediately crowded around the newscaster and started chanting about Jesus etc to the point of drowning out any comments by the newscaster herself There were lots of Gimme a J kind of chants and songs and the like Turned it into a real E Ticket ride and kept my long wait for the movie considerably less boring At any rate after the wait I had no idea what to expect about the movie and after seeing it I have to say The protesters completely missed the boat on this one I feel if they saw the movie and understood the point that is being made they d love this movie Unfortunately it s been ruined for them as I doubt that even if they did see it their eyes could un cloud long enough to get the point This movie will clearly mean far more to Christians than non Christians due to the message it presents The basis of this movie is that Christ is the Son of God and it is a basic underlying assumption throughout the entire movie that is not called into question in any way This movie asks fundamental questions some of which are the more difficult ones to answer in my opinion and answers them in a most effective and Christian manner One question could be basically worded Why did the Son of God have to be crucified for our sins The technique used to answer this question is basically to propose a scenario whereby Jesus may have had the choice to rather than be crucified for man live his life as a normal human man In this movie the alternate choice is explored via a dream sequence that occurs while he s on the cross a dream apparently under control of Satan where he imagines himself being removed off the cross by an angel followed by living out his life as a normal man getting married having children etc Satan tells him that all women are the same that when Mary Magdalene dies he can take up with another women and another etc and it is as if he is married to them all This Jesus in his dream falls for Satans line hook like and sinker thinking it is an actual message from God via the angel until at the end on his deathbed Judas points Satan out for who he she really is appeared as a little girl a la Fellini Ultimately we come to find out that as the Son of God his living a normal life would be meaningless selfish and a complete waste After all how could a Son of God just live a normal life It would only make sense if it was special in some way and having him die for us was that way So in the movie he wakes out of the dream and realizes his true destiny Now in order to present a scenario where Christ has the choice to live as a man and be plausible that he might make that wrong choice so we can evaluate the potential consequences along with the Jesus in this movie Scorsese Kazantzakis has decided to make him unsure of his true destiny and doubts himself How else could the scenario of him following plan B instead of plan A be plausible In a sense this movie explores a what if scenario in a parallel universe 1 At the very beginning of this movie there is a disclaimer that the Jesus depicted in the film is not based on the Jesus of the Gospels but on a novel 2 The movie is very modern and stylistic virtually surreal A great soundtrack by Peter Gabriel 3 The slight amount of nudity is hardly what I would call gratuitous anyone who is titillated by this movie would have to be exceedingly repressed hmmm I think a statement about it found in TIME magazine just about says it The sex scene in which Mary Magdalene entertains some customers exposes a strong womans degradation more than it does her flesh Scorsese is using modern film techniques THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST is not Disney watered down by any means 4 The first 15 minutes could easily be misinterpreted Until you get to the end of the movie and understand what the point of it all is it isn t hard to see how many people could misinterpret the apparently wimpy Jesus depicted here and the reasons why he would even visit Mary Magdalene s brothel But after seeing the entire movie and I look back on it it is necessary to the plot to establish the fact that Jesus and Mary Magdalene have the potential to be mates and establishes effectively what relationship they do have during the course of the movie 5 The protesters conjured up more blasphemous concepts via their protestations than the movie ever did In the sideshow atmosphere they created I began to envision the movie deserved carnival barkers out front screaming Step right up inside Jesus gets the girl Sex with Jesus right this way just 6 50 etc The movie wasn t like that at all If you don t take Jesus being the Son of God for granted while you can certainly enjoy the movie you will quickly realize that the movie remains completely within the context of that premise It is a movie for believers I expect that the Atheist organization that was also there passing out fliers to the attendees will be a little disappointed when they actually see the movie and find that it doesn t live up to the protester s promises I think that this movie will appeal to thinking Christians and they will find it one of the best movies about some of the concepts behind Christ ever made Nonthinking i e programmed Christians will probably never even see it or if they do won t be able to separate all of the negative things they ve imagined is going on in this movie from what is actually happening on the screen I find it pretty sad perhaps just another item on the list of monuments to the stupidity of a certain subset of Fundamentalist Christians Then again such Christians do get uncomfortable any time anyone has anything at all to say about Christ that isn t under their control Remember that the Catholic church screens a lot of reading material etc because it is over the heads of the flock s ability to keep in context and not misinterpret I could see how this movie would definitely be in that category you have to be a thinking person to add up 2 2 in this movie to get the point The protesters keep coming up with 5 Odds have it that Scorsese aimed a little over the heads of much of the audience and many people won t understand the point Further perhaps certain Fundamentalist protest groups are actually out looking for something to find fault with especially in the media and any liberal media product that wasn t strictly overseed by all knowing church members that makes statements about Jesus good or bad is a prime target I m sure The fact that they actually agree with the message does not speak well for their powers of comprehension I think any Christian who has formed an opinion of this movie based on all the misinformation floating around doesn t know what he s talking about when he makes comments Unfortunately many of these who may actually see the movie will be over prepared to tune out any potential blasphemy go to it with blinders on and exit with a see I told you so I knew what to look for and I was right it was there because they have been force fed what to read in between the lines The rest of us should go see it Christian or not and with an open mind as I think you will leave with more insight into the life of a Son of God than the protesters will ever have

0380,Clean and Sober,1988,Back in 1962 Jack Lemmon had a reputation as a comic actor and surprised audiences by playing a dramatic role and being very good at it The film was DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES The story was of a young couple with everything going for them whose lives are ripped apart by an alcoholism problem Somehow to audiences who had seen Lemmon in a humorous context his serious role seemed all the more serious Well times have changed since DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES and while alcoholism is no less a problem drug addiction is much more of a problem today so perhaps even inspired by WINE AND ROSES comedy actor Michael Keaton is currently starring in the serious CLEAN AND SOBER While DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES concentrated on why a successful young man would get an alcohol problem it is clear from early on that Daryl Poynter played by Keaton is a jerk who deserves the worst that his alcoholism and drug problem will bring him so the film wastes none of its 124 minutes on how he got into this state Instead the film starts with the incident that finally causes Keaton to check himself into a detoxification clinic and tells how even there he tries to sidestep his problem rather than confronting it Most of the film covers Keaton trying very hard to relapse into being once again the addict who embezzled 92 000 to support his habit The real heroes are ex addicts Craig played by Morgan Freeman and Richard played by M Emmet Walsh who take no nonsense in trying to straighten out Poynter against his will Craig runs the rehabilitation clinic Richard heads up the local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous Where CLEAN AND SOBER goes most astray is in Poynter s romantic attachment to fellow clinic attendee Charlie Standers played by Kathy Baker In spite of the fact that both are addicts Poynter s attempts to get involved in Standers s life are something of a diversion and a distraction from the central theme It is through his relationship with Standers that Keaton will eventually get serious about his own problem but the screentime spent on that aspect of the plot is excessive in a film that is overly long anyway That screentime could have been more effectively used in telling the story of Poynter s problem It is good to see a serious film well acted on the problem of substance abuse but a better film than CLEAN AND SOBER really is needed Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0381,Married to the Mob,1988,Capsule review Dull unfunny comedy about the families of mobsters without a single believable characterization or situation I was not fond of Demme s SOMETHING WILD but it was four times the film this is Rating low 0 I guess it is really hard to describe what makes something funny or not funny There is something about delivery where the same joke told by two different people will be funny told by only one and perhaps one person will find it funny and one will not I can see that a lot of the humor in MARRIED TO THE MOB was supposed to be funny but I cannot remember a single joke that was actually funny in the entire film You just have a film with a lot of silly situations and none of them make it to being funny Jonathan Demme has a real ear for how people don t talk and a real feeling for how people don t behave Angela De Marco Michelle Pfeiffer is a CLAP that s a Crime Lord American Princess who likes her luxurious lifestyle but does not like the thought that it was provided entirely by crime When her husband is murdered and a big Mafiosi Tony The Tiger Russo played by Dean Stockwell tries to make her his mistress she gives her entire house and its contents to charity and goes penniless with her son to live in New York City and start a new life Ah but the ties to the old life are harder to cut than that The FBI wants to use DeMarco to catch Russo Part of the task goes to Agent Mike Downey Matthew Modine playing the part looking and behaving like a high school student pretending to be an FBI agent Downey incompetently not only gets spotted by DeMarco but starts dating her Now all of this could have been a funny set of circumstances There are a lot of odd scenes but none ever get even near to funny Or Demme s film could have been whimsical if he had given some real depth to his characters that was the approach of John Huston s PRIZZI S HONOR But there characters are all flat stereotypes of little intrinsic warmth or interest They are mostly hoods with room temperature IQs rich spoiled screaming wives of hoods and FBI agents whom you would not trust to be crossing guards This is a flat uninteresting totally insight free look behind the headlines at the families of crime figures The characters are better forgotten the humor is not forgettable because it is almost impossible to find in the first place This film is to PRIZZI S HONOR what HOGAN S HEROES is to STALAG 17 Rate MARRIED TO THE MOB a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0382,Stealing Home,1988,Capsule review Can spoiled rich kid Billy Wyatt take only a half step in downward mobility by playing minor league baseball or will he spend the rest of his life living with cocktail waitresses in motels Can he decide what to do with the ashes of the only woman who ever really meant anything to him Does anyone really care Nicely photographed well edited but diffuse Rating 0 STEALING HOME is the story of Billy Wyatt at three times in his life Billy remembers the story in a set of flashbacks as he remembers the woman who was his best friend and his greatest inspiration She is Katie Chandler played by Jodie Foster who back when Billy was ten was his 16 year old babysitter The intermixed flashbacks moving forward and backward in time follow his memories of his learning of her suicide six months earlier and of her bewildering request that it be him who decides what to do with her ashes That established Billy starts thinking about his whole relationship with Katie We see Billy as a boy as a teenager and as a man as he pieces together his history with her culminating in the all important decision of where to sprinkle her oxidized remains Of course the decision of whether he will live all this life off his wealthy mother s money do you believe Blair Brown of ALTERED STATES and CONTINENTAL DIVIDE is already playing a mother with a grown son or whether he grow up and make something of himself by playing minor league baseball is also important I cannot say this film has a whole lot of anything For the teenage Billy scenes STEALING HOME tastes a little like SUMMER OF 42 concentrate It seems that Billy s best friend is infatuated with a woman he sees on the beach and under cover of dark each night he goes to stare in her bedroom window It is not really clear what all this has to do with Billy s relationship with Katie but then Billy s reminiscences do not seem to be coming from a well ordered mind and if they didn t get off the subject there would not be enough material here to fill a full length film Just as the story is a bit diffuse so are Mark Harmon s and William McNamara s performances as Billy man and boy Trying to play a sort of worldly teen and woman Jodie Foster is not going to be impressing anyone This is a film that is as soft and sweet as a bowl of Maypo Recommended to nostalgiphiles only Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0383,Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master A,1988,As an avid Freddy fan I was a little concerned about whether the folks at New Line could keep up with their own image Would it be possible for the makers of some of the best and only horror in the last few years to once again treat us to a night with Freddy the psycho we all love to love Definitely Freddy s back once again and more lovable than ever in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET PART IV THE DREAM MASTER which in my humble opinion is easily the best episode since the original Along with a large group of the faithful I saw the film on its opening night There s very little more difficult for a movie maker to do than please a jaded audience especially in the realm of horror Sure it s easy to make a movie or two with enough gimmicks and surprises and nude co eds getting hacked right after sex to pull in the teenage crowd but when your audience has come to expect good writing primo special effects and real suspense all blended with a dose of good old black humor it gets a little more difficult This is what we expected this is what we got It s hard to make me jump but jump I did a few times in the course of this little horror fest The story much as one would expect is much the same as ever Freddy Kreuger Bastard son of a hundred maniacs despite the best efforts of the folks of his home town once again decides to come back and show a few neighborhood kids around his place As always some of the kids realize what s going on and band together to bring Freddy to the hideous end he must always face In the mean time a lot of people get whacked in a lot of different and interesting ways So what s so great about all that Why of course the man himself Once again Robert Englund who is in reality the world s most harmless looking soul plays Freddy to perfection Unlike some other horror stars I could mention Freddy is a real character He doesn t just act out of some brainless and impersonal lust for gore he kills because he loves it In return his victims don t just fear him they loath him with the hatred of old enemies reunited This is the payoff for a true Freddy phile High points Apparently Freddy has decided to expand his horizons and not rely on the old glove as much as before The high tech horror fans among us will not be disappointed at some of the best F X I ve seen in quite a while Another aspect I much appreciated was that the cutesy aspect of the kids from DREAM WARRIORS A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET PART IV was gone and replaced with a sort of hip world weariness which I find a great deal more appropriate And for those who like Freddy s sense of humor the man is at his sarcastic best What a wise ass Obviously a comic genius

0385,Rocketeer The,1991,When we entered the San Diego Con Thursday I noticed a hastily scrawled note on the events chalkboard discussing the Rocketeer Movie I was intrigued by this since I had heard nothing about any adaptation of Dave Stevens characters a wayward young pilot in the late 1930s who unwittingly gains a jet pack that allows him to fly for those of you who don t read rec arts comics for film At first I thought it might be animated which was slightly amusing since Stevens whose art in THE ROCKETEER has gained him a great deal of renown is not known to be the most speedy of pencilers Anyway Kathy Li and I stopped by and took a look Stevens and two of the screenwriters for the proposed film were there to talk about it Basically it would be a live action period adventure picture set very closely to the plot of the Rocketeer graphic novel though not exactly adapting it It has after being taken around to several studios over the last two years almost been picked up by Disney they re looking for something in the Indiana Jones area and feel that the Rocketeer could be just as popular and have just as many popular sequels so do I if they can get people to really capture the period as Stevens does in his work They want to market this as much as possible a Rocketeer ride at DisneyLand Disney is about the fattest company around i e they re making good profits via Touchstone and Buena Vista so they can supply the needed budget They say a director the fellow who did HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS Bill Geer my tape recorder didn t do so well in this session has been picked and it s close to being finalized It needs to be fairly big budget since it s a period piece they want the old airplanes they want the Gee Bee very badly Dave knows where there s one in Springfield IL for the flying sequences and of course a Flying Man with a Rocket On His Back the last flying sequence is inside a building neat idea They really want it to look like Superman in the old Fleisher cartoons like he has velocity and mass not like the old Commander Cody and the Rangers of the Stratosphere As they point out this film is about flying more than anything else and so this will have to be a very strong point The two screenwriters are apparently working very closely with Stevens in fact they re scripting the next two issues of THE ROCKETEER ADVENTURE MAGAZINE with Cliff working for The Shadow in New York It sounds as if the three of them have been working together to get the picture made and Stevens feels that whatever makes THE ROCKETEER so popular in comics will be carried over to the picture at least by the script Someone asked if the in joke in the comic about the jet pack s creator it s revealed to be Howard Hughes but Hughes and his assistants are certainly meant to be Doc Savage and his aides will simply be made to be Hughes let s face it most moviegoers wouldn t get the joke J Edgar Hoover is chasing Cliff around for the jet pack and the villain is a quasi Errol Flynn character that plays off the rumors that Flynn was a Nazi much like Chaykin did in the BLACKHAWK series The sequence with Cliff rescuing the old rummy in the plane with the jet pack has been taken straight out of the movie Speaking of what makes THE ROCKETEER so popular Betty Cliff s pin up girl obsession that Stevens has rendered so memorably She ll be an voluptuous aspiring actress who doesn t act very well Well it won t be Merryl Streep They d like Matthew Modine to play Cliff but the director apparently likes Bruce Campbell sp who was in EVIL DEAD II There s also a character in the movie that they ll be introducing in the comix series very soon One interesting side story about all of this Warren Beatty is starring producing and possibly directing as get this Dick Tracy Whoever s hired him was talking a budget of 25 million but Beatty is promised to get 11 million out of the deal Be nice to see him go after Bonnie and Clyde
0386,Tucker: The Man and His Dream,1988,This movie dealt with a desperately sad subject in a way that avoided moral complexities and so much of the sadness Coppola s formula seems to have started in THE GODFATHER This is to present characters with moral ambiguity mobsters and in the case of Tucker entrepreneurs as completely good people Note that I don t think that Don Corleone or Preston Tucker were evil people I think however that Coppola ignores the evil things they may have almost unavoidably done as members of out groups in his anxiety to portray them as heroes Tucker was winging it in asking a postwar government still under almost Socialistic controls for a factory to produce his car Many things could have gone wrong for example the labor issue is ignored Tucker may not have been able to get enough workers in what was expected to be a labor glut as the vets returned from the war but what turned out to be a shortage Tucker was taking a calculated risk This could have been interpreted as dishonesty By the end of the Second World War you needed major bucks to produce cars The era of producing cars in garages had ended The government s case could have rested on the charge that Tucker was dishonest not as an out and out con man but as someone who fooled himself in thinking that a startup would work in the postwar economy The possible validity of such a charge is not addressed in the movie for it would confuse audiences Tucker is not shown either agonizing Hamlet like over this possibility or deliberately ignoring reality But it is manipulative to make a movie of an American innocent who is destroyed by those big bad car companies It is manipulative because Coppola is himself part of another big bad system for producing products for mass consumption Hollywood Interestingly Coppola likes to think of himself as a Tucker with a loyal staff of retainers each of whom knows his or her role and never steps outside of it dedicated to his goals a few years ago Esquire published a rather dictatorial memo from Coppola in which he stated that the whole purpose of his studio was to support him However his operations dovetail quite nicely I m sure with the Hollywood system for otherwise his films would not be distributed In short Coppola s Zoetrope is really a part of the system Coppola criticizes There is something unavoidable about this for it is impossible to make movies or cars without a certain highly organized and let s admit it dictatorial system But that does not reduce the manipulativeness of the process in the slightest When Francis makes a movie and we pay money to see it and he presents us with gosh all fish hooks American innocence it is I believe incumbent on us to maintain a certain ironic distance Tucker was like any man a compound of good and evil and like any entrepreneur perhaps a bit of an operator I don t know I do know that he seems in the movie itself to have bit off more than he could chew and to have wasted a lot of people s valuable time Actually gosh all fish hooks American innocence is getting to be just a bit of a geopolitical problem We ignore the Palestinians for lo these many years we overthrow democracy hither and yon then we get all flustered when people hit back and hit back hard Boyish grins a la Reagan and Tucker eventually wear thin I m reading a biography of Margaret Thatcher and although I am no fan of either I am saddened by the contrast between Ron and The Thatch Ron dithered in Beirut and lost 260 Marines Thatcher made it crystal clear what the result of Argentine conduct would be in the Falklands nonsense and backed up her words with deeds She lost only 100 more British soldiers over a much longer period and each man who fought knew what the hell was going on The difference is the difference between childhood and adulthood I am especially saddened that many would be computer entrepreneurs will see TUCKER for the computer industry is currently in somewhat the same phase of consolidation as was underwent by the auto industry Software is reaching a state of complexity where it may be impossible to go back to the garage to produce good systems which is not to say that good systems will be produced by big companies I hope that I am wrong I hope that the computer industry will not be dominated by a big three Good cars cars with seat belts engines in the back disk brakes were eventually produced not by entrepreneurs in garages but by Japanese and Germans in labor unions in great big factories Actually this is finally starting to happen in the USA In 1981 Ford and the AFL CIO agreed that Quality is Job 1 and I now own an 85 Escort that runs great gives good gas mileage didn t cost an arm and a leg and gasp doesn t have a spot of rust without being Rusty Joned This happened because management and the unions finally got off their butts under the lash of Japanese competition Of course I now understand that the Taurus has a lot of bugs my Escort is an el Strippo and the Taurus is a return to the car with a lot of high profit extras and Rome wasn t built inna day Point is Tucker and deLorean had nothing to do with this Management and gasp labor unions did it Manipulating the hopes of the little man to become a big man to his family ignoring moral complexity and depth is what Fascism is all about I like watching Coppola s films but I am disturbed by what they ve always said about life that real men prevaricate and kill to protect their families Maybe they do but the function of art is to try to purge us of the Beast through laughter and terror Coppola like Dostoeyevsky s Grand Inquisitor seems to want to saddle and mount the beast and raise the cup on which the word MYSTERY is written
0387,Deceivers The,1988,Capsule review Fun swashbuckler about a fascinating historical incident Pierce Brosnan goes undercover in India in 1825 to investigate the Cult of Kali that murdered millions of people in ritual killings Merchant Ivory A ROOM WITH A VIEW effectively remake the good STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY and do it better Rating 3 We have seen quite a number of films about the British in India films like GANDHI A PASSAGE TO INDIA THE FAR PAVILIONS and JEWEL IN THE CROWN These films have had absolutely nothing positive to say about the British As often as not it is the British themselves who are British bashing over India That is all well and good most people agree that Britain s rule was pretty bad but the question is was it so unmitigatedly bad Was there nothing worthwhile that Britain did I have asked this question of a number of Indians in this country and have gotten two different answers One answer was that British rule WAS entirely exploitation The other answer was that the British did two things for India The two things were that they built railroads and that they suppressed the Cult of the Black Mother Most people understand the concept of railroads What was the Cult of the Black Mother Well that is the subject of a new film from the Anglo Indian production company Merchant Ivory makers of films such as SHAKESPEARE WALLAH A ROOM WITH A VIEW and MAURICE First of all do not trust my opinion on this film I am a big fan of an old film made by Hammer Films called STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY Not that I trust its historical accuracy but it is a great horror film swashbuckler THE DECEIVERS is a virtual remake on a bigger budget It has more action and more thrills and as one can expect from Merchant Ivory it is better acted and scripted It is a film I wanted to see made But for one silly deus ex machina scene near the end it has just the perfect feel for this sort of film a sort of film that has not been made for several years The Cult of the Black Mother also known as the Cult of Kali whose initiates were called Thuggees from which we get the word thug or Deceivers was a secret society of adherents to a religion that believed their goddess wanted them to murder They would pretend to be pilgrims and humbly travel with parties they would meet on the road In the dark of night at a given signal they would whip out cloths and strangle their entire host s party so fast that their victims would never know anything was awry until they felt themselves being strangled Incidentally I was not a fan of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM but I still claim it did not slander Indians It had as its villains disciples of Kali and I would contend that like Nazis they are pretty much unslanderable The film claims the Thuggee cult murdered two million Indians and that may well be a low figure Travelers would just disappear and nobody would know why so any statistics are just vague guesses In addition when a husband disappeared very often the wife would often commit ritual suicide to join her husband The fate of the children might well be in question and there could well be more deaths Murdering two million people directly could indirectly cause the death of many many more Surprisingly little has been written about this relatively small cult whose toll in human misery is a significant fraction of that caused by the Third Reich Well that is mostly background What is the film itself about William Savage played by Pierce Brosnan is the tax collector of a region in which a woman wishes to commit a suicide of suttee a ritual in which a widow joins her husband Savage takes part in a ruse to dissuade the woman s suicide only to happen upon the scene of a Thuggee killing Investigating the mass murder he has witnessed he discovers just how big a conspiracy it is a part of Risking his career he disguises himself as an Indian and joins a local band The not very descriptive titles THE DECEIVERS conceals a thumping good adventure yarn that is enjoyable and which is fairly consistent with what admittedly little I know about the Cult of the Black Mother Hey I had fun with this film I like films that show me some Asian culture I like a good film particularly in the tradition of the swashbucklers I will give it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale But get someone else s opinion
0388,Betrayed,1988,Capsule review One of Costa Gavras s lesser efforts BETRAYED replaces telling a true story with telling an action adventure made up of possibly realistic elements FBI undercover agent gets the goods on a white supremacist group in a plot that generally follows Hitchcock s NOTORIOUS Rating 1 Costa Gavras makes political thrillers They always have a very left wing slant and very often he makes the United States government the villain Still his films usually get a decent following in this country and films like Z and MISSING have a near classic status Others like the extremely shrill STATE OF SIEGE may get shown but probably generate less interest Costa Gavras usually makes films that have a sort of docu drama feel basing them on actual incidents BETRAYED Costa Gavras s new film is very atypical of his films enough so that it is difficult to believe that this is also a Costa Gavras film First the docu drama feel is gone BETRAYED is not intended to be taken as a true story only to have situations that are realistic in character and which have been rearranged to tell a story One wonders if that might not be how a Greek views Z which in this country people generally view as being only a slightly fictionalized account The second major divergence is that at least superficially the U S government really are the heroes of BETRAYED the villains are the extreme right wing that is trying to organize itself in rural parts of this country And even among the villains there seem to be gradations of nastiness They all seem to be likable family men and farmers with a Jekyll Hyde edge to them We find out that the bigot who is the film s chief villain hates blacks and Jews but perhaps nearly as much he hates neo Nazis and you find yourself almost liking him when he tears into these supposed allies The film opens with San Kraus s radio show in Chicago Kraus played by Richard Libertini has the style of defending causes of tolerance not with reason but by being as insulting as possible to anyone who disagrees with him One listener whom he has previously determined is overweight he tells he will not listen to her arguments until she loses fifty pounds This is apparently the style that makes him popular We feel a little shock and not much loss when we see Kraus gunned down in a parking garage Flash to the wheat fields of Illinois where country girl from out of town Katie Phillips played by Debra Winger meets and falls for handsome farmer Gary Simmons played by Tom Berenger That is the plot for a slow half hour Finally we are told that Phillips is an undercover agent for the FBI trying to root out white supremacists and shortly after that all the nice country people we have met start revealing to Phillips that they are white supremacists and that they kill blacks for sport Well that is it She has the goods Right Wrong Her control wants her to get in deeper and deeper and to get evidence for more and more serious crimes The rest of the film follows a predictable course in a plot that dirties everyone it touches the supremacists the FBI even the kids Along the way we see white supremacist hunting a jamboree where white supremacist groups of all sorts get together and camp in happy brotherhood and teach the kids how to shoot blacks and Jews The plot gets more and more fanciful has has more action as it goes along One realizes eventually that individual scenes in the film may be based on real incidents but the plot as a whole is invented And that is disappointing Costa Gavras could have done a docu drama like MISSING or Z and instead made an action film like so many other filmmakers do BETRAYED is no more hard hitting than the very similar INTO THE HOMELAND made for cable over the past year Rate BETRAYED a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0389,Crossing Delancey,1988,Capsule review Well above average comedy drama reminiscent of MOONSTRUCK but set in the Jewish community of Manhattan Some nice characterizations in this story of a 33 year old career woman s relationships with two men Rating 2 It has been a good long while since my wife and I have found ourselves to be the youngest people in an audience but we did with CROSSING DELANCY and that in itself is a testimonial that the filmmaker must be doing something right And she is Joan Micklin Silver has directed a warm human sort of comedy that is at least comparable to MOONSTRUCK and at least in some ways better Isabelle Grossman played by Amy Irving is 33 and has a fulfilling career Working in a very literary bookstore She arranges for public readings by very good authors she runs book discussion groups she lies to her grandmother that she does not mind being single and she knows many important people in the publishing field Working hard at her job it is late at night before she gets back to her big empty apartment Knowing many major literary figures perhaps some day she will have a lasting relationship with one or perhaps even marry one Her closest relative her grandmother calls in a matchmaker for Isabelle much to Isabelle s embarrassment And who does the matchmaker suggest A pickle salesman Sam Posner played by Peter Riegart of ANIMAL HOUSE and LOCAL HERO Well he is sort of a nice guy he has a good sense of humor he obviously would like very much to get to know Isabelle he even can make sound romantic his reasons for letting a matchmaker bring him together with Isabelle But he is just a pickle salesman after all and Isabelle really has her eye on a tall handsome Dutch author Anton Maes played by Jeroen Krabbe Deep down Isabelle knows that Maes will never have time for her and that he really is not as great a writer as many think him to be But he certainly seems like a better catch than a pickle salesman If only she can find a good way to brush off Sam without feeling too guilty Based on the 1985 play by Susan Sandler has a terrific character portraits Bubbie i e Grandmother Kantor played by Reizl Bozyk is a wonderful combination of endearing and exasperating The matchmaker played by Sylvia Miles fits the stereotype of the pushy obnoxious matchmaker but then what sort of person becomes a matchmaker anyway Isabelle herself is a little flat as a character and it takes her a long time to realize what the audience knew long before CROSSING DELANCY has some totally superfluous revealing clothing and explicit sexual language but the MPAA double crossed the film and still gave it a PG Do not confuse it with a children s film Rate it 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0390,Just Imagine,1930,Capsule review This is not a particularly good film It is more of a curio of the science fiction film than a genuine entertainment experience But visually it is very interesting and historically it is the forerunner of several bad science fiction films of the 1950s Look for several familiar props like Flash Gordon s spaceship Rating 0 I am to the point now where I have seen the vast majority of the good science fiction films It has been a long time since I have seen a science fiction film I have never seen before that is more than eighteen months old and that is a film to be really enthusiastic about With that in mind I did not have high expectations for JUST IMAGINE I guess that explains why of a group of five of us who went to see the film as a group I was the only one who really thought the film was worth defending JUST IMAGINE is a 1930 American comedy apparently inspired in part by METROPOLIS The film starts by showing how different 1930 was from 1880 then proceeds to tell a story set in a 1980 as far advanced from 1930 as 1930 was over 1880 Airplanes are as common in the skies over the city as cars used to be in the streets but these planes have fans in the wings to allow them to travel slowly or even just hover while the passengers walk on the wings Some changes were not far off the mark Rather than towels sinks come equipped with electric hand driers To give the audience someone of their own time to identify with we have a man revived from fifty years of suspended animation brought on by a lightning strike The actor and as I remember character had been a sort of vaudeville comic He became a device for explaining the sights we see but the main character is a 1980 pilot who must in a court of law prove himself more worthy of the girl he loves than another man is The court considers a newspaper publisher more worthy so our hero agrees to pilot the first spaceship to Mars And what is on Mars Beautiful women Yup this is the forerunner of films such as CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON ABBOTT AND COSTELLO GO TO MARS MISSILE TO THE MOON and QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE I cannot claim to be that keen on the descendents of this film but for a 1930 film JUST IMAGINE is not too shabby Rate it a flat 0 on the 4 to 4 scale I am glad I finally saw it
0391,Midnight Movie Massacre,1988,Wade Williams is a well known fan of 1950s science fiction movies and television Of late when you see 1950s science fiction television shows turning up in video stores or on television they almost invariably show a recent copyright by Wade Williams Why he has bought up these copyrights I am not sure but rumor had it that he had rereleased the 1950 ROCKETSHIP X M with new color footage he added and was planning to do the same with HIDEOUS SUN DEMON The 1988 World Science Fiction Convention featured the world premiere of MIDNIGHT MOVIE MASSACRE a film produced by Williams To understand why this film is so bad you need to know a little of how it came to be made Wade Milliams tried to make a sendup of the old television show SPACE PATROL When the film was half made the product was clearly so incompetent that the film would never have been released Under any circumstances Never So here Williams was with only half a film that had two expensive stars and if he finished it it would be thrown out The stars Well he got Ann Robinson from WAR OF THE WORLDS and Robert Clarke who finished up a good career by being in a number of cheap bad science fiction films though perhaps none so cheap and bad as the first half of SPACE PATROL It was Williams bright idea to take his film and dress it up as an imitation dead teenager film Dead teenager films make money There are millions of teenagers willing to shell out big bucks to see fantasies of others in their age group being carved up like so much poultry Think about that if you re waiting for the next generation to come to power and improve things How do you make half of SPACE PATROL into a dead teenager film Well it is a movie that a bunch of teenagers are watching when an alien comes along and starts knocking them off So Williams can go back and forth between storylines as he shows a movie within a movie or more accurately a stupid waste of time within a stupid waste of time The outer film is a satire on 1950s science fiction films the only films Williams seems to really know well as well as being a dead teenager film So the whole outer story is set in 1956 This improves the film within since it suddenly becomes very prophetic as well as pathetic It predicts 1980s hairstyles for women When it shows the earth from space it shows light wispy clouds that were never shown in science fiction films until years later Then there is the fact that in the Midwest in 1956 read that virtually none had midnight shows Now don t get me wrong I do not mean to imply that the dead teenager portion of the film has much in the way of dead teenagers Instead it is taken up mostly by showing everything happening in the audience I won t tell all but while SPACE PATROL is stupid and dull the rest of the film can be better described as stupid dull and extremely tasteless
0393,Eight Men Out,1988,Capsule review Intriguing account of the 1919 Black Sox scandal well directed by John Sayles Like MATEWAN it is a good piece of historical story telling with an intentional political edge Rating 2 I guess it is official now at least in my own mind John Sayles is now one of the major film directors of the day He slowly built a reputation with RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN which pre dated THE BIG CHILL but was a sort of BIG CHILL with real people LIANNA and THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET But he really scored with MATEWAN the Eisenstein esque account of the coming of the union to a West Virginia coal mining town He took what was reportedly a modest budget and made an epic historical film EIGHT MEN OUT is a cut or two below MATEWAN but a pretty decent film in its own right EIGHT MEN OUT is the story of the Black Sox scandal of 1919 In that year seven players on the Chicago White Sox found themselves between the carrot of mobsters offering them bribes and the stick of owners who made large profits but did not pay a living wage and who cheated on their promises of bonuses The eighth man of the title maintained that he had never accepted any bribes Watching the results of this triangle from a distance are on one hand sportswriters and on the other the kids who are the real fans of the game Then some hoods with ties to the notorious Arnold Rothstein want to fix the World Series but are rebuffed by the players until one of the players is denied a bonus he was to have gotten if he won thirty games It seems he won twenty nine and would have won more if the owner of the club had not pulled him out of some games After that one by one the players surrender to the lure of a little easy money The willingness of the Sox to be bribed starts a sub plot of betrayal in Rothstein s organization a sub plot incidentally that Sayles never ties up In some ways EIGHT MEN OUT makes a good companion piece to THE NATURAL Both are poetically filmed stories of early baseball criminal influence and the ever present sportscasters commentary to a public hungry for sports news But perhaps because it is a true story EIGHT MEN OUT lack THE NATURAL s clean and uncomplicated storyline Actually the film is more likely to invite comparison to MATEWAN with its photography its historical storyline and several overlapping actors including Sayles himself EIGHT MEN OUT is the best sports film since THE NATURAL Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0394,Mr. North,1988,Imagine if you will Pollyanna as a man of about 28 graduated from Yale living life on his own terms and giving off slight electrical shocks to those around him Outside of that it s not much different from the Disney character and film of the same name Young Mr North Anthony Edwards wanders around very upper crust Newport Beach during the twenties installing confidence or consternation wherever he goes All the deserving characters Robert Mitchum Lauren Bacall and many many others are enriched for his acquaintance all the rotters chief among them being David Warner who hasn t played a sympathetic role since I don t know when get their comeuppance thanks to him Angelica Huston apparently learns what bio electrically stimulated means in the last scene and the history of philosophy is rather stunningly changed In short it s a cross between MY BRILLIANT CAREER and a Horatio Alger story Which is the major problem of the film None of these people seem real they re like figures in a fantasy one might construct where every good fortune that could happen does Okay one exception Harry Dean Stanton plays a marvelously comic butler but I honestly don t think Stanton could put in a bad performance if he worked at it MR NORTH has a stellar cast the film was directed by John Huston s son or grandson perhaps I m not sure there are rumors that Huston himself did a good deal of it himself before he died and he knew a lot of friends to call in for a project like this and it is fun to watch but you begin to forget about it several hours afterwards While completely unlike it in other respects it has the same overall effect as DIE HARD you watch it are entertained and then leave untainted by any real fragments of what you ve seen
0395,Dead Ringers,1988,Capsule review David Cronenberg s latest is an adaptation of the novel TWINS by Wood and Geasland with Jeremy Irons playing twin brothers The acting and the technical work are good but the storyline is slow muddled confusing and self contradictory Rating 0 Every two or three films David Cronenberg takes another few steps up the ladder of recognition His STEREO and CRIMES OF THE FUTURE are experiments that went wrong I did not find them worth watching Then came SHIVERS a k a THE PARASITE MURDERS a k a THEY CAME FROM WITHIN RABID AND THE BROOD These are diverting for horror film buffs but not actually good films SCANNERS and VIDEODROME were actually good and earned him a respectable following in his own genre With THE DEAD ZONE THE FLY and DEAD RINGERS he is building respect from general audiences In fact until very near the end DEAD RINGERS is not really a horror film at all It is something else perhaps surreal comes the closest to describing it In other ways it is unlike other Cronenberg Of all Cronenberg s major films only THE DEAD ZONE has less blood and less observable deformity Note that the deformity does not fit into the plot but seems sort of plastered on and unlike in most Cronenberg films is limited solely to dialogue and some absurd renderings of medical instruments One wonders if the mutation plot was even in the source of the story TWINS by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland The story is about identical twin gynecologists Beverly Mantle played by Jeremy Irons and his brother Elliot played by Jeremy Irons These twins are so identical that even people who know them well cannot tell them apart partially due to the fact they they even have facial marks in the same places Of the two actors Irons is probably the more charismatic and often shamelessly steals scenes from Irons From childhood Beverly and Elliot have shared interests classes experiences even lovers They imitate each other so well that they can hand lovers back and forth without the lovers suspecting Then a new lover comes along Film star Clare Niveau played by Genevieve Bujold who discovers she has been handed off She chooses one of the twins over the other and that asymmetry opens a Pandora s box in the brothers relationship DEAD RINGERS is a spotty affair that sometimes makes sense and sometimes does not Irons does as good a job of split screen acting as has ever been done And makes no mistake that is difficult acting Nobody nominated for an acting Oscar this year will have worked harder than Irons yet the chances are virtually non existent that Irons will get industry recognition for his part in DEAD RINGERS But the plot of the film is plodding and ponderous Some things that happen are never very well explained In some scenes it is unclear which brother we are seeing The final scene of the film is flatly impossible given what has led up to it Because of the flaws this gets a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0396,Deceivers The,1988,Note the the author of this is not on the net replies should be directed through the person listed on the From and Reply To lines but not to him Moderator Thugee dealt a severe blow and Indians are left reeling THE DECEIVERS Director Nicholas Meyer Producer Ismail Merchant Players Pierce Brosnan Saeed Jaffrey Shashi Kapoor English 1988 A sadhu a maharaja Colorfully bedecked elephants and a horde of nondescript natives Within minutes into THE DECEIVERS director Nicholas Meyer makes his love of stereotypes clear Shot on location in India The Deceivers also has gorgeous scenes of ravines waterfalls green jungles and a sparkling jewel bazaar But in spite of the splendid landscapes the film gives little insight into what makes the natives tick This film is a look at India with the colonial filter firmly in place Technically THE DECEIVERS is perfect In this story about thugs a group of 19th century bandits who strangled and robbed unsuspecting travelers the filmmaker s polished technique is evident throughout Thuggee itself is introduced and developed with great finesse We first see the mysterious massacre of a group of travelers Later through the eyes of District Commander William Savage Pierce Brosnan we learn that it is one in a series of ritualistic murders The strangling technique itself is ingenious and awesome a swift swishing of roomal silk bandana around the victim s neck Each subsequent thugee encounter is gripping as we witness the deceit and wait for the inevitable killing The composition of shots careful choice of visual detail and camera angles and skillful editing make for a thrilling spectacle But then one expects no less from the director of a film like Star Trek II Alas technical perfection alone does not a good film make And what this film has to say about India and Indians is insulting and offensive There is not a single Indian character here who is not stupid superstitious dangerous menacing or untrustworthy That includes children Every major Indian character in the film is a thug even the maharaja India if THE DECEIVERS is to be believed is a bizarre brutal country A long sequence shows the gruesome punishment meted to a petty thief The hapless fellow is chained to the ground while an elephant is made to walk around him in circles A crowd gathers around and the circle gets smaller and smaller until the elephant has no place to go but trample on the thief This incident takes place in the background while two men carry on a conversation indifferent to the grotesque spectacle It is scenes like this that give the impression of Indians as barbaric lawless people that glorify and romanticize the British Raj as the institution that brought law order and civilization to the subcontinent The thesis is so overdone that it loses all credibility Only passing references are made to the fact that the laws the British imposed on Indians had more to do with consolidating their stranglehold on power than to better the lot of Indians In a minor but telling concession to reality a British District Commander is shown as calmly detaining a band of thugs and grabbing his share of the loot before letting them go William Savage the officer with a missionary zeal to improve things is sternly reminded of the East India Company policy on social change Do nothing and let nothing be done His missionary zeal is more literal than you would think In a classic confrontation between Christianity and Hinduism we get the Christ of the white man pitted against the Kali worshipped by the thug Depicted as the goddess of death and destruction who demands and receives human sacrifice Kali doesn t stand a chance The impression that THE DECEIVERS leaves is that the British helped civilize India that they deserve credit for social reforms that took place under the Raj The truth of the matter is that social change in India occurred because Indians worked for it Sati did not go away because of British laws but because people like Raja Rammohan Roy worked to change social attitudes Life for Indians under the Raj was little better than that of animals In a hunting sequence British officers armed with rifles perch safely on elephants while dozens of unarmed and defenceless villagers are made to encircle and snuff a frightened tiger out of the jungle and in the direction of its imperial hunters It is hard to believe that after producing films like A ROOM WITH A VIEW and MAURICE Ismail Merchant would make a thriller with such a nakedly colonial viewpoint John Masters story is riddled with bigotry about India It is hard to say what is more offensive the uninformed blasphemy about Kali or the suggestion that sati is some mystical and inevitable offshoot of Hinduism Fake mysticism such as this can hardly bring about a deeper understanding of life in 19th century India or in the country that has evolved since
0397,Pascalis Island,1988,There was no question that I came out of this film sober and impressed The problem is that I was impressed with only one aspect of the film though Ben Kingsley as Basil Pascali a translator and spy for the Ottoman Empire just before the outbreak of World War I on a small Greek island What s amazing is that Kingsley through his superb performance in this film is almost able to carry the film despite an uneven script uninspired acting in other quarters and rather wishy washy composition It could have been a great film it is instead a good film but that should not in any way degenerate Kingsley It s as if he understood some universal body language so well that he can make you recognize his character before the story even unfolds he makes slight motions of the eyes and face that communicate a soliloquy but it s subtle enough that the viewer feels as if they ve almost missed it Simply amazing This is a tragedy in the classic sense character is brought down by a fatal flaw it is not a film that I imagine you ll feel good about after seeing it I felt like sitting in my theater chair for a half hour before even going near sunlight But if you re looking for a decent story and a stunning performance see this film
0398,Dead Ringers,1988,David Cronenberg doesn t make easy films He made the best ever Stephen King movie THE DEAD ZONE and THE FLY was one of the best films of 1986 The latter was in many circles maligned or simply ignored just because it was a horror film Hmph Beneath the goo glop and prosthetics was a psychological thriller Now Cronenberg brings us DEAD RINGERS a pure psycho thriller He proves that what really frightens you is in your mind not your eye Steve Upstill observed that this film shows a whole new level of maturity for Cronenberg His direction is deft sure and polished There isn t a note out of place His sense of visual style so striking in THE FLY has evolved into a subtle strong support for the story While giving Jeff Goldblum and Jeremy Irons the tremendous credit that is their due I cannot help but wonder if it s entirely a coincidence that they each turned in such amazing performances under the same director Irons is simply drop dead stunning in his dual role as the Mantle twins Beverly and Eliot are brilliant gynecologists with a successful fertility clinic They are identical twins so identical that they can share everything patients business appointments and women Irons who you may remember from THE MISSION has such a firm grasp of these complex characters that you can often tell within the first few seconds of a scene which twin is which Aided by a seamless perfectly executed motion control split screen system and by Cronenberg Irons does work worthy of the two Academy Awards for which he should be nominated By the end of the film it s difficult to think of him as just one man He is supported by the always fabulous Genevieve Bujold in her role as the infertile promiscuous actress You ve noticed by now that I haven t talked about the story That s because I hate spoilers in reviews Let me just encourage you to go to what is a strong contender for my top ten list this year But let me do it with a warning DEAD RINGERS is an intense psychological experience It is disturbing and tragic Nobody can give you the creeps like Cronenberg There are images and feelings which will stay with you for quite a while If you insist on leaving the theatre singing a merry song you should steer clear If you like being engrossed awed repulsed frightened and skillfully manipulated then make tracks to the movie house
0401,Gorillas in the Mist,1988,Capsule review A substantial and provocative film GORILLAS IN THE MIST tells us the story of Dian Fossey who made herself one of the leading experts on mountain gorillas and who fought for their preservation Rating 2 GORILLAS IN THE MIST is the biography of Dian Fossey a physical therapist who dropped her entire life and went to live in Central Africa to study gorillas It is the story of a passage from being a naive and selfish young dilettante to being a lion of a woman fighting for the survival of the mountain gorillas of Rwanda As the film opens there is little admirable about Dian Fossey played by Sigourney Weaver She rudely arrives in the middle of a lecture by the famous Dr Louis Leakey played by Ian Cuthbertson She even borrows a pencil for notes and apparently does not return it She doggedly follows Leakey however to persuade him to hire her to use her therapy skills to take a gorilla census After a series of misadventures she discovers the skills to approach gorillas and even to make unprecedented physical contact with them This minor victory and a new found instinct to protect the gorilla family she comes to know transforms her from a shallow amateur to a woman with a cause Almost immediately she recognizes the dangers that others of her species pose to her new found family and she finds clever and crafty ways to outsmart the poachers who prey on the gorillas For a while Fossey considers a relationship with a NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC photographer who has come to do a story on her work And there is where the film makes its biggest mistake At this point the film decides to concentrate on the mating habits of humans Director Michael Apted wastes the unique locale and the characters to tell a rather dull love story that goes on entirely too long Luckily it does not become the major thrust of GORILLAS IN THE MIST After this rather annoying diversion the film returns to the main storyline GORILLAS IN THE MIST is at its best when it shows how Fossey learned about the gorillas or how she fought poachers to help preserve the species not when it concentrates on the love life GORILLAS IN THE MIST is something of a departure for director Michael Apted whose best known film is the remarkable 28 UP the documentary that interviews the same group of people at ages 7 14 21 and 28 Yet both films show an interest in how apes and men inherit what they are and what they will become Interestingly the film s associate producer and the source of its special effects is Rick Baker a superb creator of makeup specializing in realistic portrayals of apes Almost undoubtedly he also acted in the film though his name is not listed among the mimes in the credits He proves once more that the shoddy ape work he did in the title role of the 1976 KING KONG was forced on him and below his standards At its worst GORILLAS IN THE MIST is no worse than mediocre and it does achieve moments of magnificence Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0402,Elvira Mistress of the Dark,1988,I like bad films Rather I like the genre known as badfilm You know the kind of movies Eddie Wood made like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and GLEN OR GLENDA Or movies like Eddie s disciples made like ORGY OF THE DEAD You know The kind of films Elvira Mistress of the Dark often runs on her television show But not it appears the kind of movie in which she is currently starring Cassandra Petersen has a good flair for comedy She also has big boobs and great legs She combined those assets with a black wig she s naturally blonde don tcha know and a low cut dress to create her famous late night horror hostess character In that role she provides a lot of campy fun as she pokes fun at some wretched films and at herself She made me a fan or at least got me to go see her movie I can t honestly say I had high hopes for ELVIRA but gosh it was at least co written by Petersen and fellow Groundling John Paragon Maybe it was a better movie than I thought Perhaps I have too low a tolerance for low brow double entendre Perhaps I should be able to enjoy ninety minutes of breast jokes I probably shouldn t have been thinking thoughts like Why does she do that and then complain when male characters come on to her Maybe I shouldn t have let my mind wander off to Gee puerile and juvenile rhyme sorta But maybe just maybe the film should have been better I mean it s not all bad There are a few very funny bits including a game show version of reading a will and a wonderful if late sendup of FLASHDANCE floating in this misguided morass of celluloid The director whose name I have mercifully forgotten never gets the movie on track The humor is all forced and apparently aimed at the lowest common denominator among fourteen year olds In those few cases where the movie works it appears to be by accident ELVIRA is not badfilm It doesn t try so hard to be good that it gets so bad that it s good again It doesn t know what it wants to be and as a result isn t much of anything ELVIRA may have big boobs but the really big boobs are people like me who paid 5 50 to see it
0403,Return of the Killer Tomatoes!,1988,RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES I think pretty much everybody knows that a sequel to a cult film cannot be as good Of all the films that have tried to imitate ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW s success the real sequel SHOCK TREATMENT is one of the lamest RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES fits the principle on a technicality It is to all intents and purposes not a sequel A mad scientist is creating imitation humans and he makes them from tomatoes If he made them from mushrooms or turnips the film would have a much smaller audience Stylistically RETURN is very different from the original in a lot of ways not the least of which is that it is often a lot funnier Among other things it takes a funny and well deserved swipe at product placement and another one at RAMBO This film isn t LION IN WINTER but considering it is a low budget sequel to a not very funny spoof of horror films RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES surely beats the point spread Rate it a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale DEVIL GIRL FROM MARS In spite of its title this film takes itself pretty seriously several diverse odd characters are at an isolated Scottish inn Each has his own melodramatic problems when out of the sky pops a flying saucer complete with an odd looking alien woman and a powerful robot Her mission is to kidnap a man and bring him back to Mars as breeding stock There is nothing like an alien woman with a deadly raygun and a menacing robot to help earthlings get their lives in order Even making allowances for the vintage this film is an interesting historical artifact Stylistically much like STRANGER FROM VENUS and a cut below MAN FROM PLANET X Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale THE PROJECTIONIST This film covers 24 hours in the life of a movie theater projectionist And nothing much happens to him Dull stuff you say Oddly enough no See it it is very worth seeing Our projectionist lives in a series of fantasy worlds There is a fake fantasy world he creates for his friends In it he has a desirable young woman who is very interested in him Then there is his real fantasy world in which he is a costumed super hero Then there are little short films he creates for himself in his own mind including two about the world of the future one optimistic one pessimistic All this is in stark contrast to our hero s real life he lives in a squalid little apartment and has to deal with an unreasonable boss Rodney Dangerfield in his first film role apparently There are some remarkable people working at the theater but the boss sees them as only cogs in a machine that makes money Chuck McCann plays the title role and shows some versatility and breadth Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0404,Alien Nation,1988,First of all you should go into ALIEN NATION knowing that this really isn t a science fiction picture per se It s a partner cop movie my god we ve had enough of these things to actually give it a genre with science fiction elements most of which are used for either a humor b social commentary or c the rather contrived finale Anyway if you view it as a partners movie I think it works pretty well 50 of a such a film depends on the chemistry between the partners and between James Caan and Mandy Patinkin the chemistry is there Both create characters who are complex and in Caan s case not particularly likable yet who mesh very well towards the end Caan may be crude and bigoted at least at the beginning of the film as a police detective who s partner is killed by a criminal who is also an alien aliens landed sometime in 1988 the film takes place in 1991 and much of the humor takes place from near future jokes refugees from a slave world and were integrated into society Patinkin recognizable only by his voice I ve been listening to music from SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE plays the first alien to make it to the grade of detective is partnered with Caan who wants his help in tracking down his ex partner s killers He nicknames Patinkin s character George an in joke to Patinkin s musical role I d bet since the indoctrination site gave him the name Sam Francisco and you can guess what happens next in the course of the investigation they gain grudging respect for one another become friends and eventually partners Patinkin s gentle sense of humor his immigrant s love of America to the aliens America truly is a land of freedom and his outrage as the plot unfolds endears him both to us and to Caan These guys work so well together I d like to see them in a sequel with a somewhat better plot The plot is really cops vs drug kingpins Frankly I usually find drug kingpins rather tired overworked villains but Rockne O Bannon the screenwriter makes them and the drug they sell repugnant through Patinkin s reactions and his explanation of what the drug was used when his race were slaves O Bannon also does a lot of quality dialogue and between that and the performances by the two leads the movie was a thumbs up experience There s a lovely line by Patinkin about the difference between America s ideals and how they are practiced by its citizens Its greatest failing is in the last fifteen minutes where the crime plot was dropped and another more hackneyed one is appended I don t want to give it away but suffice it to say that this would be a fine time to head to the restroom or stop by the concession stand you ll be able to predict what s going to happen and you ll be right Conclusion it s flawed by its ending but as an example of its genre I found it satisfying and a nice twist on several conventions Special kudos to Caan and Patinkin for rising above the low points of the scripts and making the film enjoyable and ha ha human A good matinee price film
0405,Alien Nation,1988,These days Hollywood science fiction films really need a high budget And they need imagination Science fiction films need a budget because the cost of automobile parts has soared Car chases are not exciting unless lots of cars get smashed up lots of shattered windshields get sprinkled over the street and lots of great makeup effects of people smashed up in the cars That costs money Then filmmakers need imagination to design new kinds of guns that the audience has not seen before Gunfights with the same old sorts of guns get boring Hollywood has come to see that science fiction fans want to see new guns in science fiction film gunfights ALIEN NATION is a science fiction film that has the car crashes and the new guns that fans demand And I hope they are happy with what they got I suspect that they will be because ALIEN NATION s basic story usually does very well whenever it shows up in a film four or five times a year As the film starts the Newcomers have been on Earth for three years Newcomers are aliens who arrived on Earth and were accepted much like and to the same degree as many other ethnic groups In fact the film glosses almost totally over how much more different an alien species would be from us than a new and even unfamiliar human ethnic group would be There are references to a very different physiology but they sure look a lot like humans over 95 of their bodies In fact the camera lingers longingly over the very human like breasts of the women Now nobody really knows why human women have globular breasts that even our closest primate relatives do not And compared to these Newcomers even daffodils are close relatives yet the Newcomers female breasts are similar enough that our main character gets a thrill fondling them Well it is just that kind of film But I am digressing The aliens live in very human like ghettos and have very human like sorts of problems Towards the end of the film we learn a few more differences but for most of the film you could easily substitute Chinese for alien and could tell the same story And undoubtedly someone has since it is a story that has been done so frequently in the past The story is the mismatched police partners You have seen it before It may not have been called 48 HOURS RED HEAT or LETHAL WEAPON There are enough of them to turn listing examples into a party game Yes there is initial friction between the partners yes they come to like each other It is all there complete with bugs gunfights and car chases James Caan does a reasonable job as Matthew Sykes whose old partner is killed by insidious aliens Mandy Patinkin is enjoyable to watch as Sam Francisco named that by an insensitive immigration official But then it cannot be really hard for them to play parts that have been done so many times before The film also features in cameo roles lots of products you can buy in your local grocery store The alien makeup is all right if scientifically unlikely and all other visual effects of the film have tires and fenders or bullets What was purported to be the year s biggest science fiction film is a huge disappointment Rate it a 1 in the 4 to 4 scale
0406,Gorillas in the Mist,1988,GORILLAS IN THE MIST unfortunately draws its style from its many Hollywood biopic predecessors It s earnest straightforward and without much point Indeed the filmmakers have dragged out the hoary old devices of a love interest the faithful servant and the wizened older woman as advice giver The film is almost painful in its predictability The film opens with Dian Fossey Sigourney Weaver rushing in to catch the last of a speech by Dr Louis Leaky read exposition She of course is single minded read character development in her attempts to corner Leaky and talk with him about going to Africa to study the near extinct mountain gorilla After two seconds of hesitation suspense he agrees From them on we get several standard episodes that could be borrowed from nearly any adventure movie script Dian arrives in Africa See naive Dian overloaded with luggage comedy See determined Dian patiently track the elusive gorillas See Dian get discouraged and consider giving it all up only to be talked out of it by the Wizened Older Woman The film continues in this vein but without any real insight into Fossey her work or what her work might have meant The audience can take nothing away with them The film indicts itself on this score when it has to insert a title card at the end explaining the importance of Fossey s work If it has to be explained the film doesn t seem to have accomplished much This is biography solely as entertainment and even then pretty pallid entertainment I don t mean to imply that this film is inept It certainly is not Indeed the gorilla effects by Rick Baker are more than convincing Most of the gorillas however are real Moderator The acting too is generally good Michael Apted is certainly a capable director AGATHA COAL MINER S DAUGHTER but the entire package is limp and lacking in imagination and energy For a cinematic biography that really soars rent Alex Cox s SID NANCY one more time
0407,Crossing Delancey,1988,Joan Micklin Silver s CROSSING DELANCY is a gem that should be cherished by filmgoers One doesn t want to overpraise a film like this because it deserves to be enjoyed as one would a light dessert It is not a heavy cinematic feast but a delightful romantic truffle Isabelle Amy Irving is a modern career woman of thirty three living in Manhattan She is fulfilled by her work has terrific friends but is unattached romantically However she is not holding her breath waiting for Mr Right she is perfectly comfortable without a man in her life Her grandmother Reizl Bozyk has other ideas She hires a marriage broker Sylvia Miles to find a husband for Issy What ensues is a clash between Issy s modern way of life and the traditional values of her grandmother Micklin Silver has pitched the film perfectly It is sweet and sentimental without being saccharine it is wise and funny without being preachy or silly Each scene is packed with wit and warmth These characters seem real The humor is the humor of everyday life and not contrived sitcom shenanigans Susan Sandler is credited with the wondrous screenplay The acting is exceptional Irving is perfect in the lead but the show stealers are Bozyk as her grandmother and Miles as the marriage broker Miles literally chews the scenery and is hilarious Look for these two when the year end award nominations are announced
0408,Mitt liv som hund,1985,This film has several good metaphors to sustain its thesis that our children don t let us down but that we adults let them down The story is told from the point of view of Ingemar a young boy whose mother is ill She never really wants to have much to do with him anyway He lives in a squalid flat with her his older brother and his favorite friend his pet dog a mongrel named Sickan Ingemar wonders several times throughout the film in voice over meditation while we see the stars in the sky just why the Russians had to shoot Laika the space dog into outer space and eventually let her starve to death as she circled the earth This in actuality is what is happening in young Ingemar s life He is starving to death for understanding affection etc This metaphor develops throughout the film as Ingemar reflects on different aspects of Laika s fate It is a powerful metaphor However the film is in no way morbid for when the mother gets too ill the boys are split up and sent away Ingemar is sent to an uncle s house which is in a village built around a local glass blowing industry Here his life picks up and there are several quite eccentric characters in the village His main relationship is with a young girl his own age who shows him how to box plays soccer on his team and yet must hide the fact that she s a girl Ingemar relaxes more in the village but wherever he is he is always portrayed as just what he is a young boy nothing more nothing less Eventually he is taken back home but his mother is even less solicitous now She has a relapse and he is packed off again to the village He is happier there anyway even though he must spend his nights now in the house of an older woman whose husband has recently died All through these events the metaphor of Laika s fate is interwoven His own dog Sickan has been put to sleep but the film does not dwell on such morbidity Another theme which reveals itself in the film is the relaxed Swedish attitude toward sex and Ingemar s basically healthy but equal lack of interest in the subject In related sequences a buxom young woman of about twenty has him accompany her to the workshop of a local sculptor who has been commissioned to do a statue of mother and child She poses naked on the floor while Ingemar waits in a side room Ingemar s uncle has the hots for this young lady and later asks him what she s like piqueing Ingemar s interest and leading to a funny situation as he falls through the skylight while trying to see her The film is set somewhere in the late 1950 s or early 1960 s about the time when Ingemar Johannson knocked out Floyd Patterson to win the heavyweight championship of the world In the final scene the people are ecstatic over the win and spill into the street shouting Ingemar didn t let us down He won for Sweden This metaphor s connection to young Ingemar s life is obvious and this is in the last analysis one of the weaknesses of the film It is just a little too obvious It is such nuances of shading I feel that can lift a movie from being good to being great The eccentric characters in the village are also a bit much but even with these weaknesses the film is most certainly worth seeing Some interesting things to watch for if you get to see this movie are the drabness of the cinematography which is in keeping with the main theme of the story the developing metaphor of Laika as it parallels Ingemar s own existence the Swedish attitude toward sex which differs profoundly from our own Ingemar s voice overs when talking about Laika This last one deserves some comment The voice overs don t hit you over the head as say Woody Allen s do in the film HANNAH AND HER SISTERS There Woody Allen talks about death as though no one in the audience has ever had similar thoughts Such heavy handedness is a fault in the arts another example might be Picasso s painting entitled GUERNICA I don t know about you but I resent it when the artist assumes that his audience is too dull witted to make any necessary connections so he himself must hit them over the head MY LIFE AS A DOG perches precariously all the way through on this invisible line Whether it succumbs in the very end is debatable but the fun times it offers along the way make it very worthwhile The metaphor of Laika in Ingemar s voice overs is very profound and moving For myself it was a treat to see such a good Swedish film Even though the Swedish is common colloquial speech it was good to hear it again As a young man I became infatuated with the Swedish language I guess I always will be In this regard let me add one final artistic note When little Ingemar goes to his uncle s village he is greeted by his uncle with Welcome to Smaland Smaland is a Swedish province its name means small land but in Swedish the reference is to little Ingemar now being in his own land where even the adults can act like children a beautiful touch Let s hope that there will be more such fine films coming to our shores soon from these interesting people the Swedes
0410,Manon des sources,1986,As anyone who has read my Seattle Film Festival reviews knows I am a prejudiced fellow And one of my biggest prejudices is French films I point to their comedies and groan I point to their dramas and grouse about characters who I couldn t give a damn about philosophizing for hours on end about their own petty problems at least MY DINNER WITH ANDRE had Wally Shawn Sure it s an ignorant generality to make and I generally go to a film regardless of national origin but if I m at the Festival and there s two films of interest and one of them s French What I will say for French films is that when they make an exception to my bigotry they really make an exception DIVA was an addiction for me I think I saw it more times than STAR WARS I played LA WALLY to all hours of the night I looked around for those silly blue liquid slo mo wave machines The guy in the white Rolls updated The Lone Ranger to a form I could actually enjoy again It was one of those films that marks a year rather than visa versa Well I just completed the two part adaptation of Pagnol s WATER OF THE HILLS and while I m not infatuated with it I am enamored of it not to mention being blown away and in a state of utmost admiration this is an amazing film and you should not miss it As many of you know MANON OF THE SPRING is the second part of a two film story begun in JEAN DE FLORETTE I saw the first film a year and a half ago at the Seattle Film Festival and was impressed and moderately entertained with its lush photography and its demonstration of how the smallest evils could be the worst MANON takes the basis of the plot in JEAN DE FLORETTE and amplifies the events of the first film into one of the finest films I have seen this year PASCALI S ISLAND was classic tragedy being played basically on one instrument Ben Kingsley in MANON the tragedy is a symphony of photography music direction by Claude Berri and the featured performer being Yves Montand It is romantic it is heart rending it gives you characters whom you feel the full spectrum of emotions for during the film s length hatred contempt pity and sympathy The layers of irony in this film are laid one atop another until the entire story of JEAN DE FLORETTE has been rotated 180 degrees and the phrase what goes around comes around is etched in your memory alongside the characters The acting is good on almost all fronts Emanuelle Beart as the grown daughter of the hunchback Jean de Florette who has her revenge on those responsible for her father s death in ways both ironic and innocent and Daniel Auteuill as the nephew of Cesar whose adherence to his uncle s policies comes back to haunt him in a multitude of ways But the performance that I will always associate with this film with both films is Yves Montand as Cesar a casually cruel man cursed with seeing his great sin turned against him in every manner possible Impersonally one would say that he gets what he deserves in the end but this film and Montand delineate his character so well that I was left thinking that no one deserved this kind of fate But the quality of this film is not limited to the actors The photography uses the wide screen to its full effect and it lingers on people and events and the gorgeous scenery with genius and often with perfection Berri directs a wedding scene towards the end which is amazing its impact to the plot had me holding my breath but the way it was shot the wedding party having their picture taken their attention arrested by Cesar s approach is one of those bits of cinematography that will be associated with the very best like the Amish rising from the wheat in the opening of WITNESS or James Dean on the windmill in GIANT It has all the beauty of a painting but is strengthened by the fluid nature of film something which is uncommon in the cinema today where motion seems to be a reason to film in and of itself The music score is as beautiful as the camera work DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT S AVAILABLE IN THE U S YET I came away from MANON OF THE SPRING feeling as if I had seen a parable about the wages of sin precisely and beautifully illustrated using characters both real and larger than life Pride greed insensitivity to your neighbor all run through MANON as much more than concepts or morality The portrayal of Hell that I have always found most appropriate is a state that men and women build for themselves with their own actions these two films reflect the type of common cruelty that is no less mean because it is widespread and then pen the originators in with their own crimes caging them with the bones of their victim It is tragedy and entertainment and yes art and I had a damn fine time watching it
0411,Born in East L.A.,1987,When you head Cheech Marin you don t think romantic comedy with a message but believe it or not that s what BORN IN EAST L A is Yes there are drugs but Cheech isn t doing them he accidentally meets up with a couple of drug smugglers Maybe it has something to do with the absence of Thomas Chong Cheech s long time partner So what is this RARA AVIS this family oriented Cheech Marin movie BORN IN EAST L A is the story of an American of Mexican origin but born and raised in East Los Angeles who accidentally gets caught up in an immigration raid on a factory So while his cousin the true illegal alien played by stand up comedian Paul Rodriguez escapes and begins to enjoy the pleasures of life in the United States occasionally with hilarious results Cheech finds himself south of the border with no way to get home or prove his citizenship But Yanqui ingenuity prevails and Cheech manages to find ways to hustle enough money to pay someone to smuggle him back across the border His life is complicated by a Nicaraguan refugee he meets and falls in love with who is also trying to get to the United States As I said this film also carries a message a very positive message about life in the United States and what is valuable about it It also has the best video to Neil Diamond s America that I have seen It points out the problems caused by an immigration policy that makes everyone of Hispanic origin an alien until proved otherwise If you avoided this film in the theaters because you don t like Cheech Marin movies give it a try now on video or cable
0412,Shy People,1987,As you watch SHY PEOPLE you re sure you know what it s about Don t be so sure At the end it makes a right turn in another direction entirely This is not bad just unexpected Jill Clayburgh is a writer for COSMOPOLITAN who decides to visit her distant relatives in Louisiana as research for a series on family roots that she is doing She drags her teen age daughter along to get her away from the daughter s 45 year old boyfriend and they head off into the swamp There she finds her cousin played by Barbara Hersey Hersey rules her family with an iron hand and a somewhat odd family it is One son has left the swamp and is treated as dead by Hersey one son is kept locked in the shed one son is missing a button and one son is trying to trap enough crayfish to keep the family fed Clayburgh and her daughter have difficulty understanding the life their cousins lead for their part Hersey and her sons look askance at Clayburgh and city people in general They keep saying Hersey comes from Baltimore even though she repeatedly tells them she is from New York probably to soften the blow of having Yankee city relatives Some of the subplots seem unnecessary but they all fit together in the end Only Hersey s character is fully developed Clayburgh doesn t seem to know how to play her character and remains unconvincing or perhaps vague is a better term through most of the film Hersey s sons and Clayburgh s daughter seem more like types than characters but the wonderful acting job by Hersey manages to overcome these flaws and make this a film worth watching
0413,Giulia e Giulia,1987,When we first see Julia played by Kathleen Turner she s happily married just married Her happiness lasts but a few hours though before her husband Paolo played by Gabriel Byrne is killed in a car accident We then jump forward seven years and see Julia going through the daily routine of her life in a state not unlike that of a zombie Then suddenly she finds herself in another world one in which her husband didn t die one in which she is still married and has a young son But this world isn t all sweetness and light either Julia in this world is cheating on her husband and being blackmailed by her lover to continue their relationship Like a pendulum she finds herself swinging back and forth between the two worlds first trying to understand what is happening and then trying to create the world she wants This is made even more confused by the fact that the person who in world two is her lover played by Sting also exists in world one as someone Julia meets in the course of the film Alternate histories are not common in film or television QUEST FOR LOVE City on the Edge of Forever STAR TREK Stay Tuned We ll Be Right Back DARKROOM AN ENGLISHMAN S CASTLE and a few others Why are they not common Well maybe it s because alternate worlds are a mental concept rather than an action concept like car chases JULIA AND JULIA demands a mental effort on the part of the viewer to keep track of who s where The film itself is slow moving and has a cold and distant feel JULIA AND JULIA was shot on video giving it a made for TV look The Italian setting it was made by RAI is well used but tends to distance the story and make both worlds unfamiliar adding to the distant feel Recommended for the more intellectually oriented viewer
0414,Lighthorsemen The,1987,Cast Peter Phelps Anthony Andrews Sigrid Thornton John Walton Tim McKenzie Jon Blake Bill Kerr Tony Bonner Shane Briant Ralph Cotterill Grant Piro Tony Bonner Patrick Frost Adrian Wright Anthony Hawkins Gerard Kennedy Graham Dow James Wright Scott Bradley Credits Directed by Simon Wincer Produced by Ian Jones and Simon Wincer Executive Producer Tony Ginnane Screenplay Ian Jones Music Composed and Arranged by Mario Millo Editor Adrian Carr Production Designer Bernard Hides Director of Photography Dean Semler A C S Sound Editors Peter Burgess Craig Carter and Livia Ruzic Stunt Coordinator Grant Page Masters of Horse Gerald Egan Bill Willoughby Jim Willoughby and Peter D Smith The Australian film renaissance began about a decade and half ago as directors like Peter Weir Gillian Armstrong George Miller Bruce Beresford and others began to create outstanding and innovative films Their creative vitality not only opened doors for newer filmmakers but assured significant worldwide distribution of a distinctly Australian cinema But it is increasingly becoming apparent that not only are the good films crossing the Pacific but the drek as well THE LIGHTHORSEMEN belongs squarely in the latter category It practically deifies an Australian military victory in World War I and throws in a ludicrously sappy romance for good measure Worse yet it tries to be all things to different people by including a subplot about a young soldier who finds it difficult to shoot a fellow human being The Australian Lighthorsemen were a group of mounted soldiers who would ride their horses near their target dismount and proceed to attack on foot like infantrymen In 1917 they won a crucial battle that broke the stalemate in the British campaign in Palestine 800 Lighthorsemen trekked through the desert and overcame a force of 4000 defenders to overtake the Turkish German stronghold of Beersheeba By capturing this strategically vital and water rich town the Lighthorsemen succeeded where the British had failed It is within this historical context that the film s events unfold The film focuses on four Lighthorsemen who take part in the attack Frank Gary Sweet Tas John Walton Scotty Jon Blake and Chiller Tim McKenzie They have been together since the battle of Gallipoli but their camaraderie is shaken early in the film when the wounded Frank is replaced by a young recruit from Melbourne named Dave Peter Phelps See accompanying article for an interview with Peter Phelps The three men initially resent Dave s attempts to fill Frank s shoes and their animosity is heighted when Dave freezes during an enemy attack While the three men deal with the loss of their buddy Dave falls in love with a young nurse named Anne Sigrid Thornton who played Jessica in THE MANY FROM SNOWY RIVER and its sequel who had taken care of Dave when he was wounded at one point Dave eventually transfers to the medical corps which conveniently puts him close to Anne The film concludes with a full scale recreation of the final charge on Beersheeba This premise allows the film to incorporate at least two factors that characterize many of the Australian films that have been exported to the US The first is the same rugged stoicism and basic masculinity of Australian men who make their home in the untamed frontier the Marlboro Man come to life that is seen in Australian films like MAD MAX 2 THE ROAD WARRIOR and CROCODILE DUNDEE The second is the superb technical command of many Australian filmmakers The Aussies are the ones who have consistently kept alive the art of widescreen shot composition and stereophonic sound in the face of the creeping influence of video Australian films like GALLIPOLI DOGS IN SPACE and THE COCA COLA KID have shown a remarkable dedication to the masterful use of Cinemascope and Dolby Stereo These two factors come into play most prominently in the last thirty minutes of THE LIGHTHORSEMEN when the soldiers make their assault on Beersheeba The film has captured the sheer spectacle of the charge so well that it rivals the chase scenes in MAD MAX 2 Cinematographer Dean Semler used a recently developed camera called a hot head a remote controlled camera fitted on the end of a mobile crane to film the men and horses in closeups that put the viewer in the thick of the battle The widescreen closeups of horses hooves are tightly edited with shots counterposing the two forces and the result is quite thrilling to watch The sound effects stereo manipulation and music by Mario Millo combine to make this the only memorable scene in the film The rest of the film can easily be thrown away because it serves little purpose other than expanding the film to feature length and giving viewers hooks to hang their emotions on While the premise may seem reasonably intelligent the stupid cliches start early The film can t have Dave be seen as a wimp so Dave proves his manhood and wins over his three partners by rescuing some horses during an enemy airplane attack When Dave awakens in a hospital after being wounded the first person he sees is Anne The look in their eyes and the love theme on the soundtrack tell the viewer instantly that a solid and everlasting romance has begun just like in the movies Neither bravery nor love is intrinsically cliched but the random way the filmmakers throw scenes and plot elements onto the screen reduces the emotions to extraordinarily hollow shells reeking of gratuitous idiocy It is downright insulting to include nice moonlit shots of Dave and Anne walking hand in hand by the seashore in a film that is trying to convey the sweat and grit of 800 soldiers who won despite impossible odds And there s no mistaking that portraying the glory of the Australian victory is supposed to be the main thrust of scriptwriter Ian Jones efforts According to the publicity materials Jones interviewed many veterans of the attack and came to view the film as a labor of love But whatever modicum of researched reality is present is constantly destroyed by the cheap emotions offered by director Simon Wincer and Jones For instance the only character in the film who doesn t have an identifying label pinned on the forehead is Major Meinertzhagen Anthony Andrews He s a slippery and enigmatic intelligence officer who devises a clever ruse to confuse the enemy about the Lighthorsemen s actual target He purposely wanders close to enemy territory and when chased by enemy troops leaves behind forged documents indicating the Australians will attack a target several miles away from Beersheeba This does in fact create suspense and it seems as though there s yet some hope left for the film But then the film degenerates again into stupidity it turns out that Meinertzhagen also included a love letter supposedly from his beau back home but written in reality by Anne earlier in the film When the Turkish officer reads the letter he is struck by how beautiful and loving the letter is Such a tender letter can come only from a most pure and honest heart he decides and on the basis of that flimsy evidence concludes that the documents are genuine and orders massive troop movements away from Beersheeba to the false target This is all too typical of how ludicrously sentimentalized the whole film is Perhaps Meinertzhagen did in fact conduct the operation this way but the way Wincer and Jones portray it leaves one gasping in outraged disbelief Even worse the politics of the film are thoroughly muddled by the fundamental ambivalence with which Wincer and Jones have infused the film To one hand they want Australians to feel patriotic pride for their country s military victory To the other they include throw away lines to satisfy the pacifists in the audience When an aide tells the commander of the Lighthorsemen how great it is that only 30 Australians died in the attack the commander leans back on his haunches and pompously proclaims Not if you re one of them It s difficult not to gag in disgust at how obligatory and empty the commander s line seems especially when the first words of the end credits proudly inform the audience that not a single horse was injured or killed in the making of the film And there s no larger significance at all to the film s depiction of Dave s refusal to shoot another human being It would have been far better to eliminate the subplot entirely rather than to give mere lip service to anti war sentiments that were so movingly portrayed in films like GALLIPOLI and PATHS OF GLORY Even the laughably ultra right wing war films like THE GREEN BERETS and RED DAWN didn t trivialize or cheapen the principles of pacifism the way THE LIGHTHORSEMEN does A final example in Lewis Milestone s ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT 1930 there is a scene where some soldiers comment on how good it is to go swimming since they haven t been able to bathe in three weeks That one comment is quite telling about the enormous hardships and difficulties that the fighting men had to face In THE LIGHTHORSEMEN there s a similar scene where the soldiers cavort nude on horseback at a seaside R R station But once again the film implodes into a ball of fluff The film conveys no sense of why the men would be eager to grab any opportunity to discard their heavy weapons and dirty clothes Instead all one sees is a bunch of men happily running around naked on the beach All these out of place scenes may lead one to think that perhaps the film is supposed to be a comedy about war like John Boorman s recent HOPE AND GLORY But whereas that excellent film used such scenes to debunk the myths of war THE LIGHTHORSEMEN in fact employs them to create new legends and fails miserably Aside from the well shot final attack scene the film does embarrassingly little credit to its Australian cinematic heritage and ends up being distastefully and stupefyingly mindless Simon Wincer seems to like horses Both PHAR LAP and THE LIGHTHORSEMEN feature horses prominently Wincer was also an executive producer of both THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER and its sequel which may help to explain why both of those films are equally as juvenile as THE LIGHTHORSEMEN He has also directed over 200 hours of Australian television including the two mini series Against the Wind and The Sullivans This running time does not include approximately 10 minutes

0416,Running on Empty,1988,RUNNING ON EMPTY is one of the best films released this year an excellent family drama with strong performances by Judd Hirsh Christine Lahti and River Phoenix The story involves a family on the run from the law In the early 1970s Art and Annie Pope Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti blew up a napalm laboratory as part of the anti war movement The explosion inadvertently blinded and paralyzed a janitor The FBI has been on their tracks for years as the Popes frequently have to move from town to town changing their identities wherever they go The movie is not so much a chase story with the Popes running from the law but rather deals with the Popes fugitive life style and the effect it has on their two sons Danny Pope River Phoenix is a 17 year old coming into manhood feeling a conflict between his own desires and the protection and safety of his parents Danny is a talented musician who is discovered by a local high school teacher and also falls in love with the teacher s daughter As Danny s musical reputation as a young prodigy spreads through the town a conflict develops because of the desire of his parents to maintain their anonymity without stunting Danny s growth The film deals with the age old struggle of becoming your own person in conflict with what your family would like you to be The actors are very believable in their roles and the film has an emotional intensity that caused quite a few tears in the audience I was in The movie also touches on the values of the 60 s generation in conflict with the traditional views of that time and how the 60 s generation have to deal with similar conflicts with the children of their own One powerful scene where Annie Pope meets her father after 15 years of absence is worth the price of admission to the film The story starts off slow and takes some time to get going but if you stick with it RUNNING ON EMPTY will really capture your attention I would give it a 3 on a 4 to 4 scale
0417,Crossing Delancey,1988,Previous reviews had Delancey misspelled the fault is mine Editor Sometimes I come into a review wondering what the hell I m going to say about it except for Gee I really enjoyed this film Romantic comedies are like that naming the genre pretty much describes what s going to happen in the movie You re left with grading the dialogue the performances and the characters Well they re all very good here As to laughter generated it was quality over quantity you really like the characters in this film you want the two principles Amy Irving Peter Riegert to get together by the end of the film unless you re a cad or a vixen and so there s a lot of understanding chuckles here along with a decent number of healthy guffaws Very brief plot synopsis it s a very small plot Amy Irving works in a very influential bookstore in Manhattan She is happy at her job where she has gotten to know many of the literary talents of our day She likes her friends and her apartment She doesn t have a boyfriend but so what Besides there s this famous devil may care poet in the area On weekends however she heads to Delancy Street a predominantly Jewish neighborhood where her grandmother lives Her grandmother loves her but fails to recognize her granddaughter s accomplishments in the face of what is to her a major failure in Irving s character s life no husband She sets up an appointment with a matchmaker who knows of a pickle vendor Riegert who is interested in her and away we go The character actors are all very good I particularly liked the actress playing the grandmother the pair who are the help at the bookstore and the fellow who plays Irving s married friend who sleeps in her apartment when his wife and he have an argument Irving herself is fine if a little low key compared to everyone else but then she is the foil for almost everyone else in the movie No scratch that Riegert is her foil and he does a wonderful job of it I ve enjoyed his work for a long time but he only seems to do about a film every couple of years Here he has been cast perfectly and has great lines to boot The audience I saw the film with were literally applauding for him to get the girl I was greatly entertained when an elderly lady sitting near me watching the poet trying to make time with Irving muttered Schmuck at him This is probably being compared to MOONSTRUCK quite a bit both are romantic comedies dealing with ethnic neighborhoods in Manhattan If you want a difference though here it is I like both films a lot MOONSTRUCK contained characters who were more on the edge with a slightly bizarre edge and it seemed to present most of the behavior through fairly sardonic eyes CROSSING DELANCEY has more realistic characters odd at times but still eccentric instead of gonzo and while it also gets its humor from the interaction of the characters it s less fractious and more sympathetic comedy If I hadn t seen MANON OF THE SPRING a couple of months ago I d say that this is the best film I ve seen since July Gentle humor but no less strong because of it s mild nature
0418,Without a Clue,1988,Farces like WITHOUT A CLUE are born with a twist a well known character or historical figure is pin wheeled around a concept that is in some way radically different from their continuity history Usually however the surprise from the twist is within full view within the first half hour meaning the film had better have some entertainment value beyond the twist itself The consequences of the twist can be more fully explored or the actors attempt to re define the characters within the scope of the twist WITHOUT A CLUE as you well know is about Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson and there is a twist in their relationship It s been discussed quite a bit in the ads and the papers but if you really want to know better bow out now I will say that it s a very funny film and worth your time if you re a Holmes fan at all The twist is that there is really no Sherlock Holmes Dr Watson Ben Kingsley created the character to cover his own fantastic abilities at deduction However he needed someone to portray Holmes to the police especially Inspector Lestrade the press and the public So he hired an alcoholic out of work actor Michael Caine to play Holmes while he Watson did the detective work This occurred nine years before the events of WITHOUT A CLUE take place Holmes has become something of a pain in the ass and he has always been a buffoon as he has convinced himself that he is mostly responsible for the success of Sherlock Holmes Tired of his antics and having his brilliance attributed to someone else Watson has decided that it is time for the two to part Unfortunately neither have particularly great luck without the other and there is this major crime threatening the economy of the Empire devised by you know who Luckily for WITHOUT A CLUE the creative staff realized that the twist was only a foundation for the movie they brought in some very impressive pillars to keep the whole thing working Michael Caine was a brilliant choice for Holmes he may be a buffoon but he is a buffoon with wit and a beautiful lack of scruples You laugh at him but you like him as well Kingsley transfers much of the classic Holmes mannerisms and acerbic nature to himself and his brilliance seems to snap from his eyes They re an odd combination of each other at times and it s little touches like that that made the film work so well not to mention how the story except for the twist didn t tread on the Canon old friends from the stories are here in numbers Wiggins and the Irregulars John Clay etc There are some wonderful lines here especially for Sherlockians and while much of the humor is physical most of it is very good slapstick the director Thom Eberhardt has a knack for framing visual comedy well Jeffrey Jones as Lestrade is an excellent foil for Caine I was laughing hard at the concept that Lestrade always baffled in the story by Holmes methods had reason to be confused as Holmes has no methods he fakes the sleuthing bit while Watson seeks clues elsewhere Finally the film is rarely obvious kudos to the writers Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther from ever letting things become routine There are negative points the physical humor does tend to the slapstick at several points and not great slapstick at that Henry Mancini s music is so damn cheery that I thought I was listening to music at the mall the main theme sounds a lot like the theme song to Captain Kangaroo And Paul Freeman plays a stock Professor Moriarty without the imagination or range that the role deserv Ahem Anyway any Holmes fan and many who are not should find this to be a real romp the kind of holiday film that it is a holiday to watch Not the best movie of the autumn but certainly one of my favorites of the year
0419,Bird,1988,Charles Parker Jr was a complicated man He was by all accounts profoundly selfish yet uncommonly generous a self pitying addict who urged people to stay away from drugs a loving husband of several wives some simultaneously who chased every skirt in sight Charles Parker Jr was also a brilliant improviser and composer He effected the second fundamental revolution in jazz music the last one to have affected the whole music from top to bottom He was a genius he was a failure he was a light in the dark he was an example of what not to be He was all these things and more at the same time laughing through the inconsistencies with the same nonchalance he brought to his soloing The wonderful thing about the film portrayal of Parker and for which we can give great thanks to director Clint Eastwood is that these contradictions are laid out unflinchingly BIRD is more interested in painting the whole picture more than accentuating the details The result is perhaps the best jazz movie ever made at least one that satisfies this casual film fan and dedicated jazz buff How to tackle the slippery topic of Charles Parker Here was a man who was fiercely conscious of his artistic accomplishments and more than anything demanded respect yet at the same time was regularly found passed out in the gutter showed up late or not at all for gigs behaved unpredictably got sick on stage and generally acted in as self destructive a manner as possible Eastwood s answer is to discard conventional linear storytelling The movie unfolds like a jazz solo with ideas popping up seemingly at random developing at a pace sometimes unrelated to that of others The overall structure and Eastwood s vision of his subject emerges only gradually almost as an afterthought Since Bird s playing often follows the same patterns this is most appropriate BIRD moves along as a series of vignettes that jump haphazardly about in time generally covering the period from 1946 55 with a couple of short jumps back to the mid 30s Eastwood seems not particularly interested in jazz history In fact several jazz fans have complained that his movie takes place after everything has already happened Indeed little or no time is spent explaining why Parker s music was so revolutionary Eastwood wants far more to describe Bird himself Of course deprived of such an important part of his context the subject loses a crucial dimension Eastwood s solution is to anchor the movie around Bird s widow Chan Parker In fact this is as much Chan s movie as anything Probably as a result their family scenes are finely detailed and revealing But this goes too far Chan s point of view is self serving She is the perfect wife the perfect mix of resignation tolerance and exasperation Chan also ignores some important facts For example Bird had a common law wife with whom he spent about as much time as with Chan and who musicians report was much more time on the scene than Chan This woman is absent from the movie and all of Bird s other women are depicted as utterly dispensable Even Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter a great fan of jazz and patron of several jazz musicians Thelonious Monk in particular the pianist wrote the tune Pannonica for her is treated as little more than a high class groupie On the other hand Diane Venora gives a strong performance as Chan expressing very well the contradictory pulls in a woman who wanted to keep her husband clean and pure by removing him from his milieu fleeing to West ches ter in his sardonic phrase yet realized that doing so would kill him just as surely Centering the movie on Chan has other more subtle drawbacks One that particularly annoyed me where are the other musicians Other than Dizzy Gillespie played by Sam Wright the only other musician mentioned is Red Rodney Where are Miles Davis Max Roach Fats Navarro Bud Powell Monk Al Haig Oscar Pettiford Don Byas Kenny Clarke Tommy Potter Curly Russell and all the others who helped forge bebop and who worked often with Bird And why give Red Rodney such prominence when Rodney was at best an occasional collaborator The story of Bird and Rodney s tour through the South where Rodney was billed as Albino Red to avoid redneck wrath on an integrated band while true is blown way out of proportion as Rodney himself has said The Buster allegory also bothers me Buster in the movie is a mythical Kansas City alto player who throws his horn in the river after seening Bird play He also seals Bird s defeat by hailing the coming of a simpler more direct music called rock n roll Little of the story makes sense First because by 1946 7 when Buster is so shamed by Bird s brilliance Parker was a celebrity among musicians From that mid 30s session where a very young Bird was gonged off a jam session by Papa Jo Jones Parker joined the bands of Jay McShann then Earl Hines then Billy Eckstine Dizzy and Clarke were in the latter and that band was as much a catalyst for the new music as Minton s and other Harlem joints that have passed into legend All that traveling made Bird a household name among musicians as Gary Giddins has shown it is also false to say that Bird and Dizzy first brought bebop to California L A already had a strong bop scene which included men such as Charles Mingus So it is extremely unlikely that in 1947 Buster would still know Bird as Charlie from just around The business about Buster pioneering rock n roll and thereby sealing Bird s defeat also makes no sense Rhythm n blues from the late 30s codified the show business approach to playing that in fact differentiates it from jazz A hornman riding one lousy B flat with honks grunts exaggerated gestures and sweat was common by the late 40s Players from John Coltrane to Yusef Lateef to Dannie Richmond put in their apprenticeships in R n B bands In fact John Coltrane dedicated himself to jazz after being asked to walk the bar one time too many As r n b people have bitterly pointed out rock n roll is r n b played by white people who get on the radio and make all the money So why should Buster s embrace of r n b be such a big deal It shouldn t But Buster s story is allegorical It signals Bird s failure to make America accept a black man s art as such Bird explicitly rejected the idea that jazz should be mere entertainment he felt it should command respect This is why he was so keen on playing with strings he felt the orchestral context gave his music legitimacy So seeing his ideas stolen by Buster stripped of their artistic aspirations and fed back to the public as pure entertainment would hurt Bird deeply This is especially true when coupled with the poignant scene where Bird drives by Stravinsky s house Parker greatly admired Stravinsky and would surely have wanted to connect with the composer on an equal footing as a fellow innovator But Stravinsky only saw a rumpled and dirty black man knocking on his door late at night and quickly went back inside to safety Thus is the paradox of Bird laid out here was a man who wanted nothing more than to be acknowledged by his country but who did almost everything possible to avoid being respected As Dizzy played by Sam Wright tells him no matter what they say these people want the nigger to be unreliable It tells them they are right in their hearts Bird knew this to be true That he at the same time never seriously attempted to prove it wrong is the essence of his contradiction and Eastwood is to be congratulated for perceiving it and making it the centerpiece of his movie Forest Whitaker is perfect as Bird He has that air of a dissolute and irresponsible little boy He is also to be praised for learning to play the instrument The scenes in which he is shown playing are entirely convincing The same cannot be said of Wright as Dizzy In the one scene in which we see him playing the trumpet he holds the instrument as if he d never seen such a thing before No matter the playing scenes are the best thing in the movie The music jumps off the screen to grab the listener The opening Lester Leaps In where a bent over Bird hovers over the audience dancing at top speed over the changes is unforgettable Excellent too are the California session in which Bird unable to find heroin sustained himself with benzedrine and alcohol thereby precipitating a nervous breakdown which led ironically to his writing such tunes as Cool Blues and Relaxing at Camarillo The scene where Buster is knocked out is also a winner In fact music alone would be sufficient cause to see this movie So is Charles Parker an American hero It depends on one s definition of hero Eastwood apparently reaches the same conclusion By painting the whole picture and leaving the interpretations to the viewer he has made more of a service to his subject than would have the fawning hero worship tribute some people wanted By keeping his own integrity by showing the warts he accords Bird the respect Charles Parker wanted
0420,Summer Story A,1988,A SUMMER STORY apparently one of the worst box office failures of this season was also one of the summer s best films Based on a story by an author best known for his appearance on high school reading lists the film involves a superficially trite love story which touches on most of the social issues in today s popular films yet addresses them with an awareness and sensitivity almost always lacking The story involves two young men students at an elite British university one is an aspiring doctor the other a lawyer and poet For a few weeks they have left behind to an extent they consider a appropriate the amenities of their affluent lives to walk across the moors of England One of the two we quickly learn is a man of the world with many opinions both about women and the social life the other is a romantic with what seem unattainably naive ideals It is this latter character around whom the story centers When his traveling companion challenges him to jump a fence he undertakes the challenge only to fall and injure his ankle preventing further travel In seeking help he encounters a young woman and her family although he immediately falls in love with the woman he quickly comes to realize that barriers of social class exist which complicate their relationship Given this start it is easy to see why the film would fail What is much harder to see is that the film much like the failed TV series THE DUCK FACTORY is an unusually well executed example of a literary form too difficult for most popular film makers to get right The relationship which evolves in the film has the poignant beauty which was one of the principal successes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN the conflict and emotions that develop when the young woman s fiance begins to suspect her unfaithfulness is reminiscent of the rivalry between Tom Pearson s Jimmy and Benton Lynch over Jane Elizabeth Firesheets in the popular novel OFF FOR THE SWEET HEREAFTER But it is not until the ending of the film that the viewer begins to realize the film s full depth The ending is formulaic and trite parts of it have appeared in numerous stories and films before Yet nowhere is it more perfectly balanced although tragic the thoughtful observer will realize that the ending is true to life The viewer is led along with the characters through a series of misconceptions always thinking that surely this familiar scene is the end of the film But no when we are finally told how the story ends and there is yet one more unexpected surprise we realize that this is a tragedy in which someone is clearly innocent but no one else is entirely guilty Even two workmen on the street some 15 years previous seem to be unwitting contributors to the tragedy Perhaps this is part of the reason for the film s unpopularity for few viewers are likely to feel less guilty only more fortunate than the characters themselves In an era in which a popular pastime is to boast of a taste for the subtle and elegant it is regrettable that this film may vanish to the archives to be a rare treat for only the most determined students of the cinema
0421,Things Change,1988,Since this is a David Mamet film he directed it and wrote the screenplay with Shel Silverstein you can count on several things 1 Certain actors will be present from Mamet s own personal stable of personal favorites in this case Joe Montagna and Robert Prosky Don Ameche is a newcomer to Mamet plays films and shares center stage with Montagna and both do a beautiful job 2 Everyone talks in a kind of rhythmic manner the phrases and words spin and loop some No people don t talk like that in real life but that s why Mamet wins awards they sound well right 3 God help you if you re trying to predict what s going to happen in this film I didn t have a clue and that was the best part of the film THINGS CHANGE generates curiosity and suspense as well as laughter melancholy and drama With that I really do not want to say much about the film I d prefer for you to go in as virgins to the story Let s just say that it s about an old shoe shiner a mob flunky on probation Reno and an interesting bunch of mob personnel that Ameche and Mantegna get mixed up in Oh it also has a moral I think
0422,Vera,1987,Vera ANN BEATRIZ NOGUEIRA Prof Paolo Trauberg RAUL CORTEZ Clara AIDA LEINER Orphanage Director CARLOS KROEBER Paizao CIDA ALMEIDA Telma ADRIANA ABUJAMRA Helena Trauberg IMARA REIS Izelda NORMA BLUM Librarians ABRAM FAARC LIANA DUVAL Director Sergio Toledo s first effort VERA is a landmark film for Brazilian cinema in large measure because of the acting talents of newcomer Ann Beatriz Nogueira and because of the subject matter of the film itself Brazilian cinema is in large measure state supported and state run roughly 40 of the tax levied on the producer s profits are fed back into the film industry by the government and before a film may be made in Brazil the producers must have the official permission of the state run Departamento de Divertimentos Publicos Divisao de Censura Further the state requires that all theatres show newsreels and short subject films of local and regional interest before every feature film Over the years such state involvement has not fostered a bristling busy cinema industry and it is a measure of the relative lack of home grown Brazilian celluloid that the government now requires that all theatres show one full length original Brazilian film for every eight foreign films It was against this backdrop several years ago that director Sergio Toledo cast Ann Beatriz Nogueira in a film that unlike so much of Brazilian cinema did not depict the history of Brazil or dramatize the local folklore VERA is groundbreaking not so much for its homosexual content but rather for its quality of being a story that could have taken place anywhere in any society VERA is the story of an unhappy young woman struggling with her identity and sexuality Reared in a Sao Paolo orphanage Vera is subject at an early age to a spartan if not positively bleak existence In the orphanage she develops her own strong belief in a kind of social Darwinism and in the process of selecting herself as one of those destined to survive comes to the conclusion that to be feminine is to be vulnerable and weak Thus like many of the other young girls in the orphanage she strives to be more masculine more aggressive and in this endeavour she is vastly more successful than her peers By the time she leaves the orphanage she is convinced that she is really a man trapped in a woman s body and she resolves herself to live out her life in a masculine fashion Following her leaving the orphanage she finds work as a librarian and begins to make masculine sexual advances towards one of her coworkers Clara It is in the context of Vera s relationship with Clara that VERA the film begins to shine Vera the character now calling herself by her surname Bauer cannot understand why Clara is upset by her sexual advances she Bauer is after all an attractive young man Clara meanwhile wrestles with her own lesbian sexual awakening The plot twists and the sexual identities of the characters become skewed and all the while director Toledo makes his most salient social commentary As Vera the character begins to bully Clara in the machismo fashion of a hot blooded Latino man Toledo poses the question of whether aggression and desire for dominance are strictly masculine traits or whether both sexes share equally in their desire to subordinate their sexual partners Further Toledo asks what the real difference is between heterosexual and homosexual love From Bauer s point of view Clara is a woman to be alternately wooed and forcefully driven into a heterosexual relationship From Clara s point of view Vera is both the alluring lesbian seductress and the domineering bull dyke Much of the weight of making the film a success falls on the shoulders of lead actress Ann Beatriz Nogueira and she bears this burden admirably as her best actress award at the 1987 Berlin film festival will attest Carrying herself as a man and managing to assume a masculine role in a serious and occasionally black dramatic work light years removed from the likes of Victor Victoria and Tootsie Nogueira earned the praise of one Latin American critic who suggested that she was destined to be Brazil s first great actress Vincent Canby of the New York Times seems to concur saying Miss Nogueira is exceptionally good in the title role Sergio Toledo as director meets with less lavish praise although few critics would suggest that as a directorial debut VERA is anything less than outstanding Vincent Canby continues his observations on the film by commenting Mr Toledo is a writer and director of real potential though he can t yet bring himself to go directly to the heart of a scene if it means sacrificing picturesque images or ruthlessly cutting out redundancies such as the television images of destructive phallic symbols that punctuate the movie from start to finish Indeed there are sequences in the film where pictorial continuity takes a backseat to the exciting camera angle and more than once the viewer s attention is drawn from the story in the time it takes to think gee what a neat camera angle or wow what a clever image Most critics would agree that Toledo still has to learn the value of subtlety Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the film is the ending which one critic described as lame not only biologically improbable it undercuts the pointed social comment that the film makes however the ending aside VERA is still a milestone for Brazilian cinema Following in the footsteps of countrywoman Fernanda Torres who won a prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival for her work in the soapsudsy Love me Forever or Never Nogueira makes a strong stamp on the international cinema scene Further under Toledo s direction she examines topics that are universal and could take place in any society not the Brazil of the historical past that brought such films as director Carlos Diegues Quilombo starring Daniel Filho Joao Nogueira to the world s attention in 1984 For a film made in a heavily state influenced industry for a directorial debut and for one of the first films from Brazil to win international acclaim VERA is truly a groundbreaking work
0423,Good Mother The,1988,Unlikely as it may seem Leonard Nimoy is one of the hottest directors in Hollywood In the land of the deaf he with pointed ears is king Successes with the Star Trek movies followed by THREE MEN AND A BABY have made him highly sought after Nimoy is now attempting to parlay his successes with comedy and science fiction into a broader career THE GOOD MOTHER is his bid for respectability While a reasonably good film itself Nimoy is not likely to strike box office pay dirt with it nor to earn the respect of his peers THE GOOD MOTHER based on a novel by Sue Miller is a serious drama about a custody suit filed against a divorced mother The underlying theme is not the custody battle itself but the concept of motherhood in modern America Is motherhood a sufficient self definition for a woman How much should a mother sacrifice for her child Should a mother have complete say over the way she raises that child The novel apparently addressed those questions squarely The film deals with them obliquely preferring to get down into the TV movie aspects of the story Given the choice of director and leading actress this approach was probably inevitable While Nimoy made STAR TREK IV entertaining and THREE MEN AND A BABY delightful he had given no indication that he had any special talent for more serious work Diane Keaton who plays the mother in the film has made a habit of having herself miscast in films based on successful novels THE GOOD MOTHER continues that trend In order to explore the issues without bogging down in the melodrama THE GOOD MOTHER needed a director experienced in the complexities of drama such as perhaps Sydney Pollack and an actress who brings less history to her roles such as perhaps Barbara Hershey But Touchstone chose commercialism over the possibility of brilliance What s most disheartening about this choice is that the powerful drama that obviously attracted all involved to THE GOOD MOTHER doesn t come through nearly as strongly as it should The fault can be divided between Michael Bortman s script Nimoy s direction and to a lesser degree to Keaton Bortman s screenplay tries to preserve some of the complexities of the novel particularly in an extended prologue that is connected to the rest of the story by theme rather than by plot This sort of digression is a commonplace in novels but is much trickier in films Bortman s script fails to integrate the prologue s theme into the rest of the film yet later scenes depend on information from the prologue making it indispensable yet irrelevant While this is the most obvious failing of the script the construction never seems very strong Also it takes far too long to get to its main conflict yet still fails to establish the necessary background to make that conflict work The dialog on the other hand is fairly good It sounds realistic without being trite and with reasonable economy conveys what must be told Nimoy s direction is competent but undistinguished The film has no strong visual feel It looks like a well lit TV movie with predictable two shots and alternating closeups during conversations Nimoy tracks the camera only when the characters are walking and otherwise moves it only when absolutely necessary The single shot that deviates from this dull pattern is itself a cinematic cliche a static medium shot of an emotionally devastated character who doesn t move as the lighting slowly changes You ve definitely seen this one before and done better David Watkin the cinematographer lights the scenes warmly and well but otherwise does not make a strong contribution to the film The pacing of THE GOOD MOTHER is staid and reverent with only a moment or two of excitement On the up side Nimoy does well with the actors at least with those who the script has provided sufficient meat to sculpt a character And while his direction shows no brilliance Nimoy makes no terrible mistakes THE GOOD MOTHER is definitely a good job of craftsmanship if not a work of art Keaton s performance is probably about as good as it could be within the boundaries she brought to the role To some extent Keaton will always live in our memories as Woody Allen s eccentric girlfriend Her success in a part often depends on whether the audience can accept that Annie Hall might have grown up to be that woman And I suppose Annie Hall could have grown up into THE GOOD MOTHER Keaton fails to lose herself in the role but gives a reasonable portrayal of what it might be like for a woman like her to have the experiences of the character in the film The problem is that her image distances us from the character it keeps bringing up the unreality of the film A lesser known actress might have been able to suck us in to the reality of a mother in danger of losing her child rather than constantly reminding us that it s only a movie Keaton s performance does carry much of the necessary anguish and passion Perhaps the only avoidable failing in her performance is that she does not show us the character s strong bond to her child She seemed more attached to the child in BABY BOOM than to her screen daughter here The script provides a few other parts worthy of notice Jason Robards does his usual wily lawyer act as Keaton s attorney It is as always a good entertaining act Ralph Bellamy s part as Keaton s grandfather seems to have suffered in the transition from novel to screen His character feels like there s a lot of explanation left out Oddly the omissions actually work perhaps because of the mystery His relationship with Teresa Wright who plays Keaton s grandmother provides the film s only suggestion that the film s characters have some life that isn t a part of this story Wright is very fine in her part She is sympathetic yet strong and convinces us that the woman she plays really lived The best of the supporting roles is that given Liam Neeson who plays the new man in Keaton s life the unwitting catalyst for the catastrophe that befalls her Neeson has often been cast in unsympathetic roles but THE GOOD MOTHER offers him practically a romantic lead The script is more than generous with his character giving him good scenes and several important dramatic moments Neeson makes the most of his opportunity THE GOOD MOTHER is a good film one well worth seeing It has power in its portrayal of a devoted mother in danger of losing custody of her child without having done anything wrong Keaton gives a fine performance the supporting cast is good the script and direction competent The only problem with THE GOOD MOTHER is that it could have been much more than it is
0424,They Live,1988,These days you have two kinds of filmmakers You have your original filmmakers who tell new stories and make new films Then you have filmmakers who recombine elements of successful movies This kind sprinkles science fiction ideas into a police action film and gets something like ALIEN NATION or DEEP SPACE One filmmaker you can usually depend on being mostly original is John Carpenter He may add some prefabricated filler but at least his films are stories you have not seen on film before This time around Carpenter has adapted a comic book version of the popular science fiction story Eight O Clock in the Morning by Ray Nelson beefed up its political message added a lot of not very imaginative padding and turned a fast paced story into a snail s paced 93 minute movie The story is that of John Nada called George Nada in the short story who gets a pair of sunglasses that allows him to see what is REALLY going on In the short story Nada is awakened too far from an hypnotic state And what is going on We are all being shepherded by aliens who to most people pass for human All our literature and advertising and television gives us nothing but subliminal messages like Buy Obey Stay asleep No imagination Marry and reproduce and No independent thought With the sunglasses the world is black and white but you can see what is really going on Hmmmm Could this be a comment on colorization The real problem with THEY LIVE is that Carpenter has taken his five page story and added little to it but padding Most of the padding is action scenes which undiscerning audiences have come to accept as a substitute for plot If the filmmaker has people shooting each other breaking windows having fist fights and in general keeping images flicking on the screen audiences do not care that the story is stopped stock still and is not advancing one whit This film is packed with very long stretches of mindless action including a seemingly endless fist fight And mindlessness in the media is very apropos for the plot of THEY LIVE though at one point in the film Carpenter explicitly lists himself and George Romero as being part of the solution rather than part of the problem In spite of the fact that there was only about thirty minutes worth of story here it is a good story and for its sake I would rate this a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Sources of Eight O Clock in the Morning by Ray Nelson MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION November 1963 BEST OF THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION 13 ed by Avram Davidson THE OTHERS ed by Terry Carr TALES OF TERROR FROM OUTER SPACE ed by R Chetwynd Hayes YEAR S BEST SCIENCE FICTION 9 ed by Judith Merril
0425,Mystic Pizza,1988,Capsule review The lives of two sisters and a friend pizza parlor waitresses is not original and the individual stories are predictable but as a whole it is a satisfying slice of life film and worth seeing Rating low 2 MYSTIC PIZZA is a sort of a THE BEST OF EVERYTHING for the Eighties I guess that in itself is something of a surprise that someone is making a THE BEST OF EVERYTHING in the Eighties It is not a film with much flash It is just a quiet dare I say it soap opera about three young women who waitress together in a pizza parlor and share each other s lives There are the two sisters Kat and Daisy and their friend Jojo Kat is the serious sort She is holding down several jobs to try to earn enough to take advantage of a scholarship from Yale Her sister Daisy is affable attractive and shoots a mean game of pool She is looking to have a little bit of fun and to live a little Jojo wants to be like Daisy Having canceled out on her wedding day she wants sex with her boyfriend but no commitments MYSTIC PIZZA is really three stories one for each woman braided together into a single story Of the three stories the film concentrates mostly on the sisters stories neither is particularly original Kat babysits for the daughter of a handsome young architect who happens to be a Yale graduate and whose wife is off in Europe You can plot this one yourself Daisy has a relationship with a rich law student with a checkered past and a bigoted family Perhaps you cannot plot this one yourself but it is unlikely you will be very surprised either So the individual stories are not much to see the film for But this is one of those films where the whole is considerably more than the sum of its parts For one thing there are few enough films that show women who are friends and how their friendship works and at times does not work MYSTIC PIZZA is not one of the year s best films though I think at least one critic was claiming that it was but at a time when so many films look alike it is a surprisingly satisfying film to watch and enjoy and hopefully is a sign of more adult films no I mean literally adult films being made Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale Oh a side note New York City restaurants offered a dinner to go with viewing BABETTE S FEAST but it was about 100 a plate After seeing TAMPOPO I could not find a Japanese noodle house nearby For those of you who want to coordinate a movie and dinner this is the film
0426,Lianna,1983,Lianna LINDA GRIFFITHS Ruth JANE HALLAREN Dick JON DEVRIES Sandy JO HENDERSON Theda JESSICA WIGHT MACDONALD Spencer JESSE SOLOMON Jerry JOHN SAYLES Sheila MAGGIE RENZI A United Artists release of a Winwood Company Production Produced by JEFFREY NELSON and MAGGIE RENZI Music by MASON DARRING Camera by AUSTIN DE BECHE Written edited and directed by JOHN SAYLES 110 minutes To a degree impossible for most films LIANNA was shaped by its director who also wrote acted in and edited the film The background of that man John Sayles perhaps explains part of the uniqueness of this film Most importantly he began his creative career not in film but as a prize winning author of short stories and novels In the late 1970 s he transferred his talents to witty and skillful screenplays and in 1980 demonstrated his control over the entire film making process through the success of his first film RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS 7 which he produced on a budget of only 60 000 Three years later Sayles produced LIANNA on a comparatively generous but still small budget of 300 000 In this film Sayle s title character Linda Griffiths is the uneasily married wife of a junior university professor whom she dropped out of college to marry At thirty three Lianna is beginning to reevaluate the direction her life is taking She is after all an unhappy woman with two children Spencer and Theda no job and a husband who warmly interacts with not one but several student bodies In a move towards self fulfillment Lianna takes a child psychology course with a visiting professor Ruth Jane Halleren The two become increasingly close and with Ruth s encouragement eventually have an affair When Lianna admits to her husband that she has had an affair Dick reacts with indifferent disdain But when she adds that the affair was with a woman Dick becomes self righteous and accusing He finds it a convenient excuse to alienate himself and the children from the wife whom he feels betrayed him sexually Lianna s new life defined internally by her choice of sexual independence but externally by damaging societal judgements is nearly as painful and complicated as her previous one Her women friends are ambivalent or reject her her adolescent children barely understand and these conflicts are only partly reconciled The aspect of the film that drew the most comment from critics was its style or lack thereof Sayles seems to consider the content of his story as being essentially independent of the film making techniques used to tell it an attitude perhaps stemming from Sayle s background as an author rather than as a director Stanley Kaufmann in The New Republic remarked The most disturbing element in Sayle s work is the suspicion that his intelligence and power of social observation satisfy him and make cinematic fluency secondary to him But the majority of the reviews while making such observations tempered their criticism by noting that in an interesting way this lack of gloss adds rather than detracts from the film s realism David Ansen of Newsweekwrote Sayle s scruffy anti style does take some getting used to initially the home movie veracity seems downright amateurish What s more Sayles isn t half as dextrous with his camera as he is is with his dialogue But eventually the characters simply win you over and the tale takes priority over its sometimes clumsy telling Sayles neglects Hollywood s technical values and emphasizes characters dialogue and story all characteristics of a good novel in a winning combination While this naturalistic low keyed interplay concentrates on credible personal dynamics it fails to deliver a dramatic peak Some critics found Sayles slice of life tone overly neutral and dull However Richard Corliss of TIME found that this avoidance of the dramatique created a social comedy which like its heroine continually discovers resources of wit and self confidence Interestingly the film s treatment of lesbianism met with a favorable response from main stream publications but opposition from magazines on opposite ends of the political spectrum MS magazine complained that the film glossed over several of the essential qualities of lesbianism LIANNA evades the deeper more perilous feelings a real Lianna would experience and provoke Lianna soars awfully quickly into the light and delight Her overnight passage into gay life is comparatively free from sexual fumbling qualms and guilt The conservative New Republic could find no explanation for her decision to tell her husband nor for his lack of understanding after she had pushed the facts in his face Despite its shortcomings LIANNA offers valuable insight into an alternative lifestyle and shows how that choice affects others It is the unique traits of Sayles as a novelist that allow this richly detailed network to be created and it is those unique traits that give the film both its strengths and its weaknesses

0430,Lair of the White Worm The,1988,Whatever else one may say about Ken Russell and his films it must be admitted that no one else makes anything like them That in and of itself is praise of some sort Originality is always hard to come by Russell delights in the outrageous the bizarre even in the tacky Yet he is a major film talent with great visual gifts Which means that whenever Russell makes a new film you never can tell what you re going to get Maybe it will be THE MUSIC LOVERS WOMEN IN LOVE MAHLER or CRIMES OF PASSION On the other hand it might be SALOME S LAST DANCE or LISZTOMANIA Part of the fun of seeing a new Ken Russell movie is finding out which Ken Russell made it THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM is vintage though minor Ken Russell It s deliciously ludicrous and just barely under control Working from a turn of the century horror novel by Bram Stoker Russell updates and subverts the horror adventure genre in his own peculiar way The results are rarely terrifying but usually thoroughly entertaining The year has yet to produce a stranger film The story begins with a Scottish archeologist unearthing a huge snakelike skull from a small excavation of a Norman convent Soon the pretty sisters who run the hotel on which the excavation took place are entangled in sinister doings concerning local legends of a great white worm pagan religion and a mysterious Lady Can the valiant archeologist and the local lord a descendant of a legendary worm slayer save the poor girls from Certain Doom Russell who also wrote the screenplay has taken a most unusual approach to the story Originally set of course around the turn of the century Russell moves it into modern times But he keeps the flavor of Victorian adventure novels With the tiniest of clues the heros spin incredible yet utterly correct theories that require complete rethinkings of their world views And the most unlikely ideas work this is a film where one can turn up a mongoose in Midland England on a moment s notice or where one s pater is certain to have some snake charming music in his old collection of North African gramophone records On the other hand Russell has injected a liberal dose of sex much of it kinky that Stoker surely did not include in the novel He lets no opportunity pass to point out the phallic significance of snakes Russell deftly turns cartwheels along a knife s edge between the delightfully silly and the naively charming balancing a metaphoric ball of perversion on his nose The film is also visually interesting Russell is bold with his camerawork as always and as always can be counted on to provide a distinctive visual style to his films In this case he and cameraman Dick Bush provide two one for the real world and one for a set of visions inspired by snake venom In the real world he moves the camera smoothly and unobtrusively lights the scenes with a fair number of sinister shadows and frequently recourses to wide angle lens to distort the picture sometimes slightly sometimes wildly In the visions Russell overlights and flattens the shots uses garish colors snaps jarringly from one shot to the next and generally makes everything look cheap and sleazy One has definitely left one world and entered another when he switches styles Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the film is Russell s attention to details He is absolutely serious about being silly so when the evil villainess picks up a hitchhiker for nefarious purposes it is of course a Boy Scout Where does she spend her sleeping hours In an Indian snake basket of course And her favorite game is Snakes and Ladders Russell extends this attention to detail into the characters The local lord has a wonderfully odd butler who obviously has no respect for his master and is prone to fall into vaguely lewd reminiscences of his adventures with the previous lord His expression on being told to lock the chambermaids in their rooms is almost worth the price of admission on its own In general Russell s actors give him precisely what he wants straight faced performances despite the general silliness The heros keep their upper lips stiff despite appalling dangers the heroines scream on cue and the supporting players die in stereotype The one exception well calculated is Amanda Donohoe who plays the sinister villainess conveying not only the menace of the character but an amusing self awareness about just how dotty her religion is Catherine Oxenberg and Sammi Davis play the girls while Peter Capaldi and Hugh Grant last seen as the aristocrat in Maurice play the archeologist and the lord respectively One could not really say that THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM is a good film but it certainly isn t a dull one Russell has never done anything quite like it before yet it bears his distinctive mark and could not possibly have been made by anyone else One leaves the theater wondering that he actually made this film and that somebody gave him millions of dollars to do it and that against all odds THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM was actually quite entertaining
0431,Salaire de la peur Le,1953,In Central America four men carry nitroglycerine over bumpy roads and pray that nothing sets their cargo off THE WAGES OF FEAR 1953 is one of those film I had wanted to see for years but I really did not expect to like it a lot First of all I had seen Clouzot s DIABOLIQUE and was not greatly impressed even though it is considered a sort of semi classic I d seen too many similar films mostly from Hammer Films Now I had seen SORCEROR William Friedkin s remake of THE WAGES OF FEAR and thought it was an okay exercise in suspense In some ways it was a better approach telling more of the history of the four drivers though it suffered from an overblown budget that got used on things like car chases unnecessary to the plot I had also seen a similar film I ve forgotten the title about trucking rocket fuel So I knew that seeing the original robbed of its novelty could be a disappointment Au contraire THE WAGES OF FEAR is a white knuckle sort of suspense film Somewhere in Central America there is a town probably one of many that is a slow death trap To leave takes money a lot of money But no job in town pays well enough to earn that kind of money at least no job left Those who cannot get jobs with the big American oil company are doomed by poverty to stay in the little town until they work themselves to death But suddenly there is work Four truck drivers are needed to haul nitroglycerine to a burning oil well and the oil company will pay 2000 for a day s work for anyone crazy enough to go on what might be a suicide mission Carrying nitro every twist in the road every pothole every unforeseen bump every mudhole becomes a death trap This is film noir with a vengeance every yard of unpaved road becomes an enemy trying to find one unwary moment to go for the kill If that sounds over dramatic see the film Each man reacts differently to the pressures one is coldly efficient one is sloppy and foolhardy taking foolish risks one is heroic and one crumbles under the weight of fear Ad ittedly there are some problems with THE WAGES OF FEAR It takes a little too long for the plot to get underway The final moments of the film are hackneyed There are scenes so absurd as to be humorous For example an oil company foreman demonstrates the power of nitro by throwing some on the floor of his office But it is a film that works and works well enough to get audible gasps from the audience THE WAGES OF FEAR is a classic that deserves to be Rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0432,Noi vivi,1942,In 1942 Italy was at war with the Allies in more ways than one Without permission or legal rights they thumbed their noses held by the enemy They started writing their own FLASH GORDON comic strips hiring for the task two young unknown Italian cartoonists one of whom was Federico Fellini who later was to have some association with the film industry Also without permission and certainly in direct opposition to her philosophy the state appropriated film rights to Ayn Rand s semi autobiographical first novel WE THE LIVING Goffredo Alessandrini adapted the anti Communist novel into a film NOI VIVI WE THE LIVING played for about five months before a reportedly furious Mussolini decided the film was an argument against any totalitarian government and had the film banned In 1968 after much effort lawyers for Ayn Rand found a copy of the film in a vault outside Rome Ms Rand not happy with the original film re edited it and redubbed parts WE THE LIVING is now having its first United States release It would be nice to report as is usually the case when an old lost film is discovered that it is a wonderful classic that we are all culturally poorer for for having been deprived of all these years It may have been true of Gance s NAPOLEON it is patently not true of WE THE LIVING The re released film is only a moderately enjoyable melodrama made with some of the faulty conventions but also some of the cinematic artistry of the period That means it s no CITIZEN KANE but it stacks up really well next to ALIEN NATION In post Revolutionary Russia Kira s family of ex aristocrats returns to the city they will always call Petrograd and take up residence in a few rooms of what used to be their house Young Kira played by Alida Valli has no respect for anyone who works for the new Soviet government She rebuffs the advances of her cousin Victor a loyal Party member and instead has a monthly rendezvous with Leo played by Rossano Brazzi the son of a famous counter revolutionary The police are looking for Leo and Kira is nearly pulled into trouble with him Yet unbidden people in high places seem to intervene in her behalf One of Kira s unbidden saviors is Andrei played by Fosco Giachetti an inspector for the GPU security police who seems anxious to reunite the two lovers This is the beginning of a story that spans several years in the lives of Kira Leo and Andrei a story involving politics and crime love and death WE THE LIVING was made at a time when great care was taken to compose scenes visually A vast number of Soviet propaganda posters were somehow obtained or perhaps invented for the filming Yet not everything makes sense as it was filmed One wonders how in an economy of shortages Kira is always able to wear lipstick and eye makeup flawlessly applied In one scene the characters come into a warm building from the snow yet the snow on their shoulders refuses to melt Ayn Rand s stories always seem to be overblown melodramas having larger than life characters who refuse to capitulate to the demands of society And the stories usually culminate in the hero making an impassioned speech of Rand s personal philosophy that society tries to tear down the individual as a sort of dubious benefit to an undeserving multitude This version of WE THE LIVING is no exception however the speech seems to make little sense in the context of the film And the speech scene is quite noticeably one of those scenes that were re dubbed One wonders if in the original the speech was so noticeable a non sequitur WE THE LIVING is diverting fare but falls well short of being a classic Still it is valuable as an artifact of World War II history as well as film history and a reminder of what films used to be Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0433,Little Dorrit,1988,Hollywood has been doing violence to the works of Charles Dickens for some years now At this very instant two of his best known works are being mangled on screen in SCROOGED and OLIVER AND COMPANY I mean this not as a value judgement of those films but in reference to their fidelity to either the letter or the spirit of their originals Even the best film versions of Dickens even those from Britain typically fail to give the full experience of a Dickens novel LITTLE DORRIT comes closer to that experience than any film ever has before And even more amazingly it manages to also make its own artistic statement in addition to rather than instead of what Dickens intended One obvious attribute that LITTLE DORRIT shares with the novel is length The novel was nearly a thousand pages The film is around six hours long It is shown in two parts subtitled Nobody s Fault and Little Dorrit s Story Though some reviewers have claimed otherwise they are not independent The first part doesn t conclude the story and the second doesn t contain enough information to explain what is going on Moreover there is a definite order to the two parts Seeing Nobody s Fault first will lead to a much clearer view of the film than seeing Little Dorrit s Story first LITTLE DORRIT like most of Dickens novels is a panoramic story set in London in the mid 18th Century Typical of Dickens the central character is a child in trouble Little Dorrit is a young woman born and raised in Marshalsea a London debtors prison Her father has been imprisoned there for over twenty years and has become known as The Father of Marshalsea They have no real hope that he will ever be released and only the efforts of Little Dorrit plus Mr Dorrit s shameless habit of playing on the guilt of visitors allow the family to live in some small comfort But the picture changes when Arthur Clennam a decent middle aged man recently returned from China takes notice of her He devotes himself to helping the Dorrit family and perhaps there will be some chance of obtaining the father s release As in all Dickens story this barebones outline just scratches the surface of the myriad subplots and complexities of the story Underlying the plot is the theme of society s collective guilt for its treatment of its least fortunate The title of the first half of the film is a recurring refrain It s too bad but it s nobody s fault Nothing is anybody s fault nobody is to blame and by extension nothing can be done By focusing on this message the film version of LITTLE DORRIT proves just as relevant for today as the novel was for Dickens time The least fortunate are still miserable and it s still nobody s fault because though rarely acknowledged it s really everybody s fault LITTLE DORRIT works then on the levels of a pure entertainment and as a social commentary But surprisingly it also has an interesting third level The two parts of the film cover substantially the same ground Many scenes from the first half are partially duplicated in the second But the first part is told from the point of view of Clennam while the second is told from the point of view of Little Dorrit The repeated scenes are different not only in viewpoint but in subtle details of conversation settings even costumes By the middle of the second part we realize that what we saw in the first part was highly subjective It was how Clennam viewed the events of the story and that viewpoint was not omniscient even in the scenes that he himself participated in Nor is Little Dorrit s view of the scenes necessarily correct or even any more correct than Clennam s At first this duplication smacks a little of a not very interesting trick So the viewpoints are different so what How does that fit in with the rest of the film s themes But more consideration shows that the bifurcation does fit in perfectly First we see the story from the point of view of a privileged person for whom the ills of society really are nobody s fault He is a decent good man but he cannot see that the society which supports and affirms him by its very nature stamps down and denies others Then we see the story from the point of view of one who has directly suffered from the machineries of that society someone who can clearly see that there is fault to be laid at the feet of those who do nothing to relieve the suffering of the less fortunate that they are profiting at the expense of the poor The perniciousness of assigning no blame becomes very clear Writer director Christine Edzard has brought to the film not just fidelity and love but inspiration Adding to the effect are the performances Derek Jacobi and Alec Guinness as Clennam and Mr Dorrit lead a cast of less familiar names but great talents Jacobi takes a passive role that could easily have been boring and makes every instant of it fascinating He s done this before and I can think of no surer mark of a great actor than to be able to hold the attention of an audience while playing a quiet role in the midst of many other colorful characters Guinness performance is also superb Mr Dorrit is in some ways pitiable in others almost a monster He is a man obsessed with appearances even while in the depths of poverty He doesn t mind his daughter slaving to permit him small luxuries but he makes sure no one sees her doing it Guinness uses every tool of the actor brilliantly to make us understand sympathize and condemn his character A few names in the supporting cast are familiar Robert Morley shows up briefly almost irrelevantly Cyril Cusack plays Guinness brother quietly but effectively Joan Greenwood is the picture of motherhood as a flinty barren field The rest of the roles are filled by fine British actors with faces that are sometimes familiar and are always brimming with Dickensian eccentricity Especially fine are Roshan Seth as the brisk somewhat mysterious Mr Pancks and Miriam Margolyes as the love of Clennam s youth Margolyes produces perhaps the finest Dickens comic caricature ever brought to the screen and is utterly hilarious Sarah Pickering deserves special mention The role of Little Dorrit is even more passive than that of Clennam yet Pickering uses every opportunity the script offers to show her quiet self effacing heroism LITTLE DORRIT all six hours of it was shot in a studio It shows yet perhaps that is not inappropriate In some sense Dickens writing portrayed the literary equivalent of a studio version of 19th century England It was not precisely realistic but offered a concentrated artificial version of the real world that paradoxically allowed him to more closely approach the truth of the age than strictly accurate reportage ever could Christine Edzard uses the studio to the same effect Artifice is plain enough that we never truly believe that her cameras have traveled through time to the 19th century but the artifice is so well and carefully crafted that we feel the essence of the time The sets and costumes are little short of brilliant Almost everything used in the film was produced from scratch for the film The care for detail is obvious as is the research that must have gone into the art direction And these details are not merely window dressing but are used to deepen and broaden the canvas of the film The costumes give a further dimension to each character and the sets establish not just place but mood LITTLE DORRIT offers an unusually fine example of the use of visual details to support a film LITTLE DORRIT is not without its weaknesses The primary one is that the second half of the film is too repetitious Edzard had to tread a fine line between repeating too much of the material from the first half and not showing enough of it to make the differences in the points of view clear She seems to have erred on the side of revisiting too much material This problem is compounded by the fact that few interesting new characters are introduced in the second half of the film and also by seeing too little of the most entertaining characters from the first half Another flaw that could have been easily avoided is confusion in the final resolution of a mystery set up practically from the beginning of the film Given that the film ran six hours surely another minute could have been devoted to clearing up the rather tangled strands From a technical point of view sometimes the limited budget shows through a bit too clearly particularly in some of the mattes and models But these weaknesses are minor On the whole Edzard has made a superb film LITTLE DORRIT is most heartening because it shows not only talent but true direction Most promising new directors make more interesting versions of what everyone else is making Edzard has boldly chosen a path of her own and leads the rest of the participants of the film in the direction she has discovered LITTLE DORRIT may not be the easiest film to see but it is extremely entertaining artistically satisfying and socially conscious No other film I ve seen this year has tried so much The real miracle of LITTLE DORRIT is how much of the ambition has been realized
0435,High Spirits,1988,Short take of my reaction to HIGH SPIRITS Staggering out from the theater in exaggerated Peter O Toole shambling walk opening eyes in terror and going OH MY GOD in the best O Toole ian tones Talk about wretched refuse The story of this film about a castle run by O Toole which is about to be moved to the United States unless O Toole can turn it into a successful haunted hotel splits down the middle the first half being O Toole and Irish cronies trying to convince the tourists that the house is haunted with very bad slapstick The second half is where one of the tourists Steve Guttenberg surprise surprise discovers a real ghost Darryl Hannah and promptly falls in love with her The script at this point makes no sense whatsoever pulling scenes from previous ghost films as some type of precedent for what happens here It s awful and I mean AWFUL my review of SCROOGED is going to be bad but I laughed at that There wasn t one single solitary laugh in HIGH SPIRITS not one A complete waste of my money Not to mention a waste of talent as three very talented at least in previous films people worked on this 1 O Toole who has done crap before anyone remember SUPERGIRL but whose performances of genius THE STUNT MAN THE LION IN WINTER excuse him at least until he does a PORKY S sequel This is close to the limit though 3 Neil Jordan the director writer OK reality check have I read the credits to HIGH SPIRITS incorrectly Neil Jordan is the director co writer of the brilliant MONA LISA a few years ago What happened since then Complete mental collapse HIGH SPIRITS gives one the feeling that he gave up by the time shooting began PS Not under the heading of waste of talent but have you wondered if Steve Guttenberg ever says No to any part he s offered Or is he just listed by Actor s Equity as generic amiable dolt
0436,Scrooged,1988,I have to wonder what drug addled studio executive came up with the idea of having Michael O Donoghue co write an adaptation of a Charles Dickens short story O Donoghue is probably to Dickens what the Anti Christ is to Jesus the man is brilliant at producing dark satirical humor but I ve yet to see him come up with anything that could be even remotely referred to as heartwarming Or civil for that matter So I went into this film assuming that it was going to be a complete send up on A CHRISTMAS CAROL and for a little while it does OK the good points it has a three minute opening sequence a promo for a holiday special with Lee Majors that I literally howled at Pure O Donoghue Then zip Outside of a decent but not inspired zinger from Murray on the average of once every two minutes not counting the ugh finale and maybe Carol Kane I think she s been over rated here the laughs are few and far between What s worse the film keeps trying to waffle between satiric jesting and endearing sentimentality and it ends up being icky How icky Oh lord You ve heard other reviewers mention how bad the last ten minutes are as the reformed Murray address a TV audience Trust me it made me angry to watch this I nearly killed an usher with a glower on the way out of the theater All the actors try to look like they think Murray s artificial speech is touching while the silent audience appeared to be memorizing where the exits were in case of fire This was bad Golden Turkey level bad Nas teee Besides Kane I have to credit Alfre Woodward for one of the two moments that had any real warmth to them I knew she was a good actress but how she remained convincing during the conclusion is truly incredible And a few points to Bill Murray for trying to drag something out of this the scene where he finds Michael J Pollard frozen actually worked at least for the first minute But really avoid this like the plague Except for the Lee Majors promo That was cute

The,1988,You are going to have to stick with the old arm chair historian on this one THE NAKED GUN has a long history In 1974 a film was made that was sort of a radical experiment in comedy films THE GROOVE TUBE was a sort of satire on television that was not a single story but a set of black out sketches lampooning all aspects of television It spawned a host of imitators one of the best being KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE which was written in large part by three men Jim Abrahams David Zucker and Jerry Zucker Like THE GROOVE TUBE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE was mostly made up of very short sketches but it included A Fistful of Yen a very extended satire on the Bruce Lee film ENTER THE DRAGON It was clear that someone felt the same madcap style could be applied to longer satires Meanwhile in another part of the forest a production company called Quinn Martin was making a set of popular television series including THE F B I THE FUGITIVE RUN FOR YOUR LIFE THE INVADERS and a police show or two all using much the same style of story telling making them an easy target for satire But television was not yet ready for the Abrahams Zucker Zucker style of comedy What made all the difference was when the Abrahams Zucker Zucker took a mediocre but popular television movie TERROR IN THE SKY which was in itself a remake of ZERO HOUR and remade it using the same three joke a minute style they had used in A Fistful of Yen The result was AIRPLANE It proved to the networks that there was a viable market for satire or at least the Abrahams Zucker Zucker brand of satire But could the Abrahams Zucker Zucker style of humor be applied to a regular television series and could it garner an audience big enough to sustain it In a word no While POLICE SQUAD was certainly one of the most inventive comedy programs ever on network television outside of a loyal core of fans my wife among them people saw it once or twice and then felt they had seen it By the time it was on there were fewer Quinn Martin productions on television anyway so perhaps fewer people even remembered the Quinn Martin cliches like the dramatic voice reading the title of the episode After one season of six shows the series was apparently no longer profitable enough to continue and was relegated to the ranks of cult television Abrahams Zucker Zucker have since made two more theatrical films TOP SECRET and now the POLICE SQUAD movie THE NAKED GUN While Police Lieutenant Drebbin played by Leslie Nielsen is off in Lebanon beating up every anti American world and leader and warning them to keep out of America one of his own undercover agents is shot left for dead and framed for heroin running Drebbin investigates and finds at the heart of the matter a drug kingpin played by Ricardo Montalban in his second film adaptation of a cult television show with a plan to kill Queen Elizabeth I will not spend a lot of time on the plot since it is clear the filmmakers did not either I will say that notably missing are some of the best running gags like the omniscient shoeshine boy and the frozen scene end titles The real problem with the POLICE SQUAD movie is that it is not really a POLICE SQUAD movie While it has a touch of the old style of three jokes a minute it segues into the Inspector Clouseau style in which the jokes are as funny probably but each one lasts longer and there are fewer Clouseau humor relied on the personality that Peter Sellers was able to put into the character while the original POLICE SQUAD s jokes were a steady barrage from all directions Leslie Nielsen s Drebbin does not have the personal appeal that Sellers gave Clouseau As a lampoon of police shows POLICE SQUAD took every cliche it could find and turned each one on its head It took place in a uniformly insane world THE NAKED GUN like the Clouseau films takes place in a sane world with one insane man This leads to a different character of film altogether It is slower and less interesting I would think it would be unlikely people would want to see Nielsen reprise his role again and again the way Sellers was able to In spite of a number of funny moments quite a number in fact THE NAKED GUN is a misfire and will probably be a one shot Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0438,Cocoon: The Return,1988,Short description Not much of a movie but it make a nice bookend to go with COCOON Well everybody comes back from the first movie everybody and a lot of them think about whether it was a good idea to leave Earth in the first place and one of the cocoons gets picked up by an oceanographic research institute where Courtney Assault Dimples Cox works and Brother is there a lot of padding in this film 40 minutes could have been cut out and nobody would have been the wiser Yes some of the charm of the original is still there but it s either strained or canned from COCOON There are some really ridiculous plot holes running around especially regarding how security for the alien is handled Carl s Rent A Cop guarding extra terrestrials Sigh After the Christmas season so far I m having to put all my hopes on THE NAKED GUN the local radio promos have been hilarious LESLIE NIELSON as Virtue Incarnate PRISCILLA PRESLEY as Lust Personified RICARDO MONTELBON as Pond Scum in Human Form You ve heard the ad now see the movie Then buy the silverware
0439,Mystic Pizza,1988,There s certainly nothing new in the plot behind MYSTIC PIZZA Three girls working as waitresses in a pizza parlor in Mystic Connecticut and their romantic entanglements during the summer and fall of one year One is just on the edge of matrimony with a fisherman but can t quite cross the line another a vivacious local who wants to leave Mystic and gets involved with a rich out of towner and her younger sister about to go to Yale and falling in love with a married man However the film makes its mark from the first shot with its infectious sense of humor and the collection of local characters it showcases The actors are given dialogue they can really get laughter out of and they soon have developed characters who you are like quite a bit especially the three lead actresses Finally not all of the plot is cut and dried I was surprised several times with where the plot headed and for those points where it wheeled around predictably it did so with style and enthusiasm which belayed the cliche situations A good full price film and something of a surprise The Mystic Pizza in MYSTIC PIZZA resembles the film the elements aren t revolutionary but they re full bodied and the mixture is just right
0440,Rain Man,1988,Capsule review Barry Levinson s occasionally humorous drama of a razzle dazzle car salesman and an autistic savant This is perhaps Hoffman s most demanding role since his performance as Ratso Rizzo in MIDNIGHT COWBOY RAIN MAN is one of the few films really worth seeing this holiday season Rating 2 These days we see a lot of films about outsiders and how they see and fit into our society SPLASH showed us the theme with a mermaid STARMAN E T BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET and any number of others have used aliens MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON and even RED HEAT did it with Soviets Of course you do not have to go to another planet or the Soviet Union to find outsiders We have institutions full of people whose view of the world is radically different from yours or mine But where is the pleasure of seeing a film about people with so called mental disorders That is the stuff of television movies perhaps but they rarely make it into theatrical films as anything but killers But if anyone is going to make an original theatrical film about mental disability few filmmakers can do it as well as Levinson Barry Levinson is one of these days all too few filmmakers who is willing to take a chance on the type of film they make and then make it work for them Besides making THE NATURAL perhaps the best sports film ever he made an enjoyable film about salesmen of aluminum siding and of course his two best known films DINER and GOOD MORNING VIETNAM With the possible exception of GOOD MORNING VIETNAM his films are fresh and different from anything else being made In Levinson s latest film RAIN MAN Tom Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt Babbitt is the kind of car dealer that the man who sold you your last car would really like to be the kind of salesman you hope never to run into and the kind of salesman which on your salary you probably never WILL run into Charlie is a wheeler dealer who may have his hand in many pots but when we see him he is dealing in ultra expensive cars razzle dazzling them past the EPA and making enormous profits He uses people like toys and loves only money At the death of his father his only emotion is greed He is all ready to happily inherit millions but instead gets a shock At the reading of the will he finds out that his father has chosen to leave the bulk of the estate to someone else Why Well I may be the only reviewer in the world who doesn t give away that plot twist The actual beneficiary is Raymond an autistic savant What is an autistic savant It is a person who generally lives in a world of his own but in just a few skills he is good enough to boggle the mind Now Raymond played by Dustin Hoffman has a rather remarkable mind Like most autistic minds his usually is off in a twilight zone of unrelated thoughts He talks a sort of verbal fruit cocktail Yet at the same time he is capable of incredible mental gymnastics Given two three digit numbers he can visualize their product and simply read it off Overturn a box of toothpicks and he can almost instantly count them just by looking Given a date he knows its day of the week Actually I can do this one myself but it takes me twenty seconds or so Raymond knows instantly Charlie formulates a scheme to steal the inheritance but as it progresses Charlie finds he must spend more time with Raymond than he ever expected Initially Charlie has no sense of wonder about Raymond s mind Charlie is just one more person to use But eventually Raymond s lightning flashes of numerical brilliance and his innocence begin to win over even Charlie As with MIDNIGHT COWBOY Dustin Hoffman does not play the main character at least the character was not written that way But let us face it the day that Hoffman cannot out act Cruise he might as well hang it up This is Hoffman s movie as much as or more so than MIDNIGHT COWBOY was Tom Cruise does an adequate acting job and no more is really necessary Even if Cruise were a much better actor than he is when Hoffman is on the screen all eyes would still be on Hoffman If Hoffman fails at all in this film it is in not really giving us enough insight into Raymond s mind We see enough of Raymond s world view to whet our appetite to see more but we never get sufficient insight into who his mind works Perhaps nobody but an autistic savant knows how an autistic savant thinks But in a very disappointing holiday season s crop of films RAIN MAN stands out like Raymond himself does Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0441,Man for All Seasons A,1988,I like film more than most people And I have seen a lot of films that have deeply affected me but my favorite film of all time is Fred Zinnemann s 1966 A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS Back when I was in graduate school I had the entire film on audiotape and would play it two or three times a week It was the second film I had recorded on audiotape in a collection of eventually hundreds It was the FIRST film I ever recorded on videotape to keep Very well I could never expect the new version to measure up I was sure I would begrudge the film every minor variation from the original That expectation turned out to be wrong but not by a whole lot The plot and most of the dialogue are of course identical to the Zinnemann version The first plus for the remake is that it follows very closely the original stage play The original film rearranged things a little For those who have not seen the 1966 version you have my pity and this plot synopsis A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is Robert Bolt s play about the results of Thomas More s choice of principle and integrity over all else More had an extremely nimble mind a love of his king and close friend Henry VIII and a love of his religion Catholicism These loves are perfectly consistent until Henry decides to split from the Church and expects the endorsement of the nobility Being asked to choose between his loves More decides to be officially neutral with full knowledge that the law should protect his stand For the lack of one oath of support Henry s agents make war on More They have the power of the king More has only the law and his agile use of it to protect himself For this version Charleton Heston both plays More and directs He certainly has more name recognition than Paul Scofield who played the role in the Zinnemann version Scofield is better known for stage than for film Heston s dramatic talent and acting range lie somewhere between those of a Scofield and those of say a Sylvester Stallone and I would guess it lies at just about the halfway point Heston has none of the frailty of Scofield He has always overpowered his roles When More tells Henry that he is sick to think how much his More s actions grieve Henry Heston gives the line as if it is a matter of form as if he is playing chess The pain in Scofield s delivery gives the line far more sincerity He is a friend who has to hurt a friend and does not want to while Heston s More is only saying what is expected In one scene in the play More breaks down and cries Scofield lets his voice break up and then sobs He does it gently Heston contorts his face in agony He just cannot project gentle emotions so he rarely uses them One place where the remake should have been an improvement and disappointingly was not was in the role of Wolsey Where Zinnemann had Orson Welles Heston had John Gielgud Both are good actors but I generally would give the edge to Gielgud But not in this film When Heston faces Gielgud each knows his own lines but they are not playing off of each other Talking about actions that will be taken against the Church Wolsey refers to certain measures perhaps regrettable perhaps not then noting More s wry smile All right regrettable Gielgud does not stop to see the smile He runs the two lines together with no change of tone and there is no wry smile It is a misdelivery and a better director than Heston would have corrected it Vanessa Redgrave the only obvious actor to play in both versions goes from playing a nubile Anne Boleyn to Alice More s wife Wendy Hiller played the role as an intelligent willful woman who when she calls herself a fool clearly means it only in contrast to More Redgrave really plays it as a fool doughty flutterly and superficial with just a hint of something deeper behind the gestures Her interpretation is certainly a valid one but as with most interpretations of roles in the Heston version she is not as appealing as she was in the original film All these criticisms are of course only contrasts to the original film In its own right the Heston version is an excellent film It is a superb play done with a very good cast It raises the same issues as the other version and has the same excellent writing There is little even an indifferent filmmaker could have done to hurt the story In good conscience I could not give the Heston film anything beneath a high 2 To my mind however the Best Picture of 1966 remains the best picture of all seasons
0442,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,1988,Capsule review Enjoyable remake of BEDTIME STORY with only minor variations The contest for ascendency between two gigolos still makes a very funny comedy perhaps more so because it has less competition than the story had in 1964 It is much like seeing a new production of a play you once enjoyed It loses a point for borrowing so but from the original but still rates a 1 Back in 1964 Ralph Levy a television director made the first of only two theatrical films he was to make before returning to television BEDTIME STORY was for the time a minor and somewhat fluffy comedy about two gigolos contest to see which one would have to leave a French Riviera town too small to support more than one gigolo There was Lawrence played by David Niven who had made Beaumont sur Mer his private hunting ground for finding rich women to fleece And then there was Freddy a brash young American soldier with no respect for the culture and no affection for the women he was preying on Freddy was one of Marlon Brando s most memorable roles and perhaps the only time Brando ever got to play broad comedy And Brando was hilarious throughout the film but particularly when Freddy was pretending to be Ruprecht who was the retarded product of too much inbreeding of nobility With only minor changes to most of the script if memory serves most of the film even has the same dialogue the script has been effectively recycled to make DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS BEDTIME STORY s script was by Stanley Shapiro who also produced that film and Paul Henning DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS executive producer Dale Launer cut some scenes including a few of the better gags rewrote the ending and put his name in front of the other two for screen credit The story remains the same Whoever can be the first to charm 50 000 from visiting soap queen Janet earns the right to rule the roost in Beaumont sur Mer The loser must leave town The new director Frank Oz does little with the principle characters that Levy did not Michael Caine the new Lawrence plays his role surprisingly David Niven ish right down to the thin moustache Frank Oz seems to have known what he wanted from the part but his ideas were formed by seeing the earlier film Steve Martin puts a little more of his own interpretation into Freddy but in places like the Ruprecht scenes he is more mimicking Brando than creating his own character What is surprising about seeing the remake is how good the writing seems to be today In 1964 one would have hardly considered BEDTIME STORY to have had a really well crafted script Yet today that same script seems to be much closer to the caliber of A FISH CALLED WANDA than to that of BEETLEJUICE or SCROOGED It deals in genuinely funny situations not just funny personalities What was ordinary writing in 1964 is well above average in 1988 Had this been a completely original script DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS would have gotten an easy 2 As it stands it still gets a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0443,Wash The,1988,I for one like my melodramas small It s not a hard and fast rule but following the average ups and downs of a human life or lives aren t a draw by themselves Acting dialogue setting and photography are major factors in grading a film and if these four elements are not particularly outstanding I m left with the basic plot In that case the last thing I want to see is a personal problems movie blown up to epic proportions like setting it in Africa and giving it an eight digit budget and putting Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in it I think we can see see the whipping boy here hmmm THE WASH is another film sponsored by the American Playhouse group and they are really putting together a track record of small budgeted pictures which act as slice of life stories set throughout the U S None of these films is immensely memorable but they are both thoughtful and thought provoking and I ve never been bored at one A FLASH OF GREEN dealt with a small community in Florida being picked apart by real estate developers SILENCE AT BETHANY is staged around a Pennsylvania Mennonite community during the early 1940s THE WASH deals with an elderly Japanese American couple and their two daughters who live in an unspecified urban area LA Sacramento I m not sure it was ever specified The father a silent curmudgeon lives in the family home while his wife has moved out of the house and is living in an apartment His domineering sullen behavior has driven her to a separation but she still stops by once a week to drop off groceries pick up the laundry hence the name of the film and make a stab at reestablishing communications with her husband The film details the effects of her beginning to date another man on her husband her daughters and finally herself One daughter is straight laced rather uptight and convinced that her mother and father will eventually get back together ignoring the rocky ground her own relationship is on The other daughter has been ostracized by her father for marrying a black man and is reluctant to help or hinder the situation between her parents For the most part the film concentrates on the relationships between these people with few embellishes besides some comic relief at a restaurant that the father frequents Since these AP films tend to work at being as Spartan as possible in describing their characters I usually end up grading the films on the acting and how well the characters resonated for me Both the performances and the plot were good without being very good except for the actress playing the mother who was splendid She conveys the confusion and happiness her new boyfriend brings her at 60 and the scenes between them are very fresh Her work pushes my grade to a satisfied if not enthusiastic thumbs up a good Saturday afternoon movie and a definite recommendation when it appears on PBS s AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE
0447,Land Before Time The,1988,It is surprising that Disney studios never did cute animation of dinosaurs They have done cute versions of most familiar animals in their various films dogs cats pigs mice birds fish insects and those were just bit parts in cartoons that does not count as continuing characters But the only time Disney ever did dinosaurs was in FANTASIA and there they were just big meaty blood and thunder engines of destruction who crashed into each other to the tune of Stravinsky s Rite of Spring As much as children love dinosaurs already Disney never animated a dinosaur that was even remotely likable Not that it was a void that really needed filling but Disney animation department veteran Don Bluth who specializes in imitating Disney s animation heyday has made an almost feature length animated film THE LAND BEFORE TIME about the adventures of some likable baby dinosaurs And Bluth uses flat animation in what may be the only serious attempt of such animation since FANTASIA and a good while before The field of animating dinosaurs has been very nearly the exclusive province of dimensional animators such as Willis O Brien Ray Harryhausen Jim Danforth and David Allen In spite of the principle that flat animation offers the artist greater freedom of expression admittedly at the cost of some realism it has very rarely been used for dinosaurs But I rather suspect that the real inspiration for THE LAND BEFORE TIME came from the dinosaur art of William Stout particularly as seen in his 1982 book THE DINOSAURS Bantam Books 12 95 Unlike most dinosaur artists who try for a realistic almost photographic style Stout s art is more stylized and almost comic book like He tries more for caricature rather than for realism and so is able to put more expression into his dinosaurs I do not remember if Stout s name appeared in the credits of THE LAND BEFORE TIME but several of the illustrations from THE DINOSAURS are dramatized in the film including an appealing camarasaurus baby hatching from an egg Another illustration shows ultrasauri standing among trees The top of the painting cuts off the heads but a visual analogy between the necks and the treetrunks is implied This scene also appeared in the film It is difficult to decide when THE LAND BEFORE TIME would have taken place One needs to identify exactly what dinosaurs we are seeing I have heard the main character Littlefoot described as a brontosaurus If that was what was intended then Bluth and company were hopelessly sloppy Most of the dinosaurs in the film did not live until the late or Upper Cretaceous Period sort of the grand finale of dinosaur life that brought into existence familiar dinosaurs such as triceratops and tyrannosaurus That is entirely the wrong era for brontosauri more accurately called apatosauri But then the dinosaurs of the film had more rounded faces than apatosauri would have had They had the rounded faces that brontosauri used to be portrayed as having Also apatosaurus died out in the late Jurassic era even camarasaurus which outlasted them and lived only into the EARLY or Lower Cretaceous was not contemporary with late Cretaceous animals Littlefoot could have been some lesser known species of sauropod some of which did live late enough to be contemporary with triceratops The stegosaurus also is an Upper Jurassic dinosaur but some of its similar looking relatives could have been alive in the mid to late Cretaceous Before you decide that the questions of era are trivial matters realize that the Upper Cretaceous has been over for 70 million years and you can see how much animal life has changed since then Go back another 70 million years and you are just about at the end of the Jurassic period with the Cretaceous soon to begin Bigmouth incidentally is a parasaurolophus who is respectably Upper Cretaceous And what appeared to be a dimetrodon that should have died out 150 million years before this story was more likely an Upper Cretaceous spinosaurus Stretching a point all these dinosaurs could have been contemporaries but it still seems unlikely Even more questionable is the geological background of the film Yes the Earth was geologically active at that time but nowhere near as active as shown In a short space we see the characters encountering powerful earthquakes and unrelated volcanos and they struggle with a tar pit Even in a geologically active era this is entirely too much activity to be credible The story of THE LAND BEFORE TIME is about a baby sauropod of some sort they call themselves long necks who is born in a time when food is scarce His mother wants to take him along with his grandparents to the great valley where for some reason food is still plentiful in spite of the fact that every dinosaur and his brother is headed there or is already there Along the way he meets a cute pugnacious little girl triceratops but the parents of both know that mixed species relationships rarely work out Each gets the sort of reaction you would get if you told your parents you were really good friends with a sheep Through circumstances I will not describe Littlefoot finds he must make the journey without his elders Instead a set of lost young dinosaurs band together to make the trip as group The story could be reasonable but the characterization is not The characters are not well developed Littlefoot goes through all kinds of tribulations without giving up then suddenly at some point gives up entirely possible but unlikely behavior And if you doubt that real characterization can be done in an animated film see WATERSHIP DOWN or THE PLAGUE DOGS THE LAND BEFORE TIME is a short film even by animated film standards It is just 66 minutes long so short in fact that it is always shown with a cartoon Family Dog The cartoon by the way is the first half of Family Dog the February 16 1987 episode of Steven Spielberg s AMAZING STORIES television show If it seems like it ends a trifle abruptly that is why If it means anything they have chosen the best piece of the original broadcast Apparently they could get the cartoon cheaply since Spielberg was one of the executive producers of THE LAND BEFORE TIME THE LAND BEFORE TIME does boast a nice score by James Horner and an okay song sung by Diana Ross But it still does not show the effort of other animated feature films And padding the length with part of an episode of AMAZING STORIES is no substitute for the kind of story telling that Disney Studios or even Bluth himself have done in the past Rate THE LAND BEFORE TIME a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0448,Not of This Earth,1988,Somebody once said that if you remake a film remake one you can improve on not a classic If that is true you could do much worse than to choose Roger Corman s 1957 NOT OF THIS EARTH a lackluster quickie with Paul Birch looking like a businessman in sunglasses and riding around in a big black Cadillac His real mission was to collect blood and other biological samples from humans and ship them off to his home planet where they are needed for a war Beverly Garland played Nadine Storey a registered nurse hired to take care of what she thinks is just an unusual patient and slowly comes to realize he was dah dah duh DAH not of this earth Even as a fan of 1950s science fiction films I have always been indifferent to NOT OF THIS EARTH Improving on it should not be difficult if it has to be remade The weakness of the original makes it all the more surprising that the remake actually turns out to be a travesty on the original The Beverly Garland role now has ex porn star Traci Lords who can act her way out of her clothing much easier than she could a paper bag The film has been peppered with tasteless nude scenes and an occasional car chase or two but nothing that improves on the plot Little vignettes intended to be humorous like a bag lady who thinks she has a radio to heaven simply fall flat The original was a solid 1 on the 4 to 4 scale the remake is 2
0449,Lair of the White Worm The,1988,Some of the most stylish and interesting horror are those directed by Terence Fisher Fisher s films include HORROR OF DRACULA KISS OF THE VAMPIRE ISLAND OF TERROR and THE DEVIL S BRIDE a k a THE DEVIL RIDES OUT Some have said that Fisher is to horror films what Hitchcock is to suspense Any year is a banner year for horror fans when two Terence Fisher films come out 1988 is such a year well sort of Lamentably Fisher died several years ago but if the term Hitchcockian can be applied to films done in his style you should be able to do the same thing with Fisher For Fisher making horror films was an art Making films about razor gloves or hockey masked killers and mass producing those is at best a craft and barely that But 1988 can boast two films in the best traditions of Fisher both made by filmmakers with much better reputations THE DECEIVERS was directed by James Ivory and LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM was directed by Ken Russell Russell like to spice his films with sequences of near hallucinatory images Sometimes that works as it did in ALTERED STATES or THE DEVILS Sometimes it is a complete non sequitur as in CRIMES OF PASSION He let weirdness totally take hold of his last film GOTHIC but with LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM he is back telling a story reasonably linearly And while it is not his most ambitious project making a 1960s style horror film and doing it well is better than trying to do a biography of Tchaikovsky and trashing it as badly as Russell did with THE MUSIC LOVERS In this case Russell s source was the Bram Stoker novel of the same title Stoker also wrote JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS which was adapted into THE MUMMY S SHROUD and THE AWAKENING And oh yes he wrote a book called DRACULA which if I remember has been the basis of a few films Since before the Garden of Eden the god of the Bible has been at war with the primal snake god Dionin Through the ages various snake cults have flourished and where necessary opposed Christianity as well as Conan A disciple of Dionin thousands of years old thanks to clean living and the power of the snake god has set up shop on the English countryside where legend has it a great worm was slain by a Lord D Ampton after it had feasted on people and cows Since then there had been disappearances in the region but not enough to cause too much fuss until the discovery of the skull of some inexplicable animal is found by a Scottish visitor Then things start to happen Surprisingly for a film by Russell LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM is if anything a bit lightweight But it is a well crafted horror film He finds surprising places to hint at snake shapes in the film from a water hose to the insignia on a policeman s collar Amanda Donohoe makes a superbly sensuous villainess and is always marvelous to watch but never more so than when she is seducing an unlucky but eager Boy Scout for the greater glory of Dionin LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM will probably be my favorite Ken Russell film I sat through it twice and had a great time both viewings Rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0450,Dangerous Life A,1988,The title is A DANGEROUS LIFE and if that title seems to be reminiscent of the title of Peter Weir s popular YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY it may not be just a coincidence I suppose the title could refer to it being dangerous for people that Ferdinand Marcos was alive and in power or it could refer to fictional newsman Tony O Neil s played by Gary Busey occasionally endangered existence covering dramatic events in the Philippines from the death of Ninoy Aquino to the fall of Marcos and the presidency of Ninoy s widow Corazon Even if the title seems a little crass the three part nearly six hour mini series delivers as a dramatic political story and at the same time as an historical chronicle Because the title and subject matter conjure memories of YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY A DANGEROUS LIFE invites comparison of the two films The Weir film had one charismatic enigmatic character Billy Kwan A DANGEROUS LIFE has no particularly fascinating character in a leading role The main characters are involved in a nominal but dull love triangle Who cares In virtually every other regard A DANGEROUS LIFE is a model for the political chronicle It tells a piece of history most of us remember and tells in a dramatic and engrossing way a detailed history of the fall of Marcos And it seems even more immediate for the extensive use of television news videotape Actually for interest value the lead parts are eclipsed by that of Imelda Marcos played by Tessie Tomas Most people think of her as a sort of international joke a vain woman who had a huge collection of shoes Under Robert Markowitz s direction she is as hypnotic and deadly as a cobra a consummate politician and actress If it seems by the second installment that the story is going overly long have faith the third and final part more than compensates One complaint that could be made is that it is a trifle one sided It does not protect the United States government which gets a thorough and very probably well deserved lambasting for valuing its Philippine military bases over the lives of the Filipino people But Corazon Aquino is just a little too saintly and pure Making her so perfect makes the film seem a little manipulative But as a fault this is only a very minor one This production for HBO will inevitably be the first American made for television film to ever make my Ten Best of the Year list Rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0451,Twins,1988,Capsule review Two winning comic actors DeVito and Schwarzenegger overcome a severely problem ridden hodge podge of a script to make a comedy that is at least enjoyable if little more Rating 0 Hollywood long ago discovered that film formulae carried with them built in audiences Make a film in the formula you get the audience Frankenstein movies had a built in audience that was interested in seeing any film about Frankenstein Abbott and Costello comedies had a different built in audience If you make a film like ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN you get both audiences Never mind the fact that Abbott and Costello film style is really incompatible with Frankenstein film style The technique of crossing formulae was usually restricted to B films A films seemed not to need it But in the 1980s while the distinction between B films and A films is much less obvious most films made are what used to be B films And crossing formulae is done in clever ways but is more prevalent than ever That s why Tom Cruise s young high gloss smoothie characters teenage audience pleasers appear opposite serious characters from serious adult dramas In THE COLOR OF MONEY Cruise plays opposite Paul Newman s Fast Eddie Felsen from the realistic gritty film THE HUSTLER Then Cruise plays opposite Dustin Hoffman s autistic savant in RAIN MAN These are films trying to bring in more than one pre made audience But the most blatant formula mixer in recent history is TWINS This film is a Danny DeVito comedy an Arnold Schwarzenegger action film a science fiction film a warm human relationship film a crime story a bit of CROCODILE DUNDEE and much more How do they fit all these things together Not very well TWINS is more a pile of plot elemnets than an actual story To read the credits TWINS seems to have been made from two different scripts and the result was a film with two different plots going on simultaneously One is the story of how two brothers created by a scientific experiment go out in search of their origins The other story is how DeVito gets involved with industrial espionage ends up in over his head and is rescued by his large powerful brother The plot of TWINS is full of coincidences which range from unlikely to absurd It has problems of casting Arnold Schwarzenegger could be the required age of 35 but DeVito is too old for the part It assumes that one person could have six different fathers That is dubious even with modern gene splicing technology but it is ludicrous with 1953 technology And then the concept of the six fathers is never really used in the plot The climax of the film occurs with DeVito inexplicably knowing how to use a piece of equipment that does not make any sense even when you know what it does Sorry that statement probably will not make sense until you see the film but people who have seen the film should know what that is all about The script of this film is a mess Any chemistry between DeVito and Schwarzenegger seems forced but each has talent as a comic actor in his own right and that together with a pacing that keeps things happening is what makes the film as watchable as it is Rate it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0452,Dangerous Liaisons,1988,It is the France of Louis XVI and the aristocracy has turned sex into a game like chess with strategy and tactics The Marquise de Merteuil seems prim and proper but behind the facade she is a conniving power monger who on a whim can destroy the lives of those around her If less capable of escaping notice for his sexual manipulations no less adroit at the manipulation is the Vicomte de Valmont The Marquise to get revenge on a former lover suggests that the Vicomte seduce the innocent 16 year old fiancee of the lover But the Vicomte considers seduction of the innocent too small a challenge instead he will attempt seduction of the truly virtuous and proposes to bed the highly moral Madame de Tourvel The Vicomte then proceeds to accomplish both challenges and the film becomes a sort of sexual Mission Impossible as under a cultured facade this merciless game of strategy and tactics takes place Based on the stage play LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES and the 1782 novel of the same title by Choderlos de Laclos DANGEROUS LIAISONS comes to the screen beautifully directed by Stephen Frears Losing the immediacy of a live on stage performance Frears takes full advantage of the new medium by making use of the most perfect facial expressions by John Malkovich as the Vicomte and by Glenn Close as the Marquise Even if such expression were possible in the stage play it would be lost on all but the first few rows The film also stars semi actress Michelle Pfeiffer who is as out classed by Close and Malkovich as her character is by theirs Frears uses her as little more than a mannequin It is unfortunate for her sake that she and Frears were content to let her give such a flat performance in a film in which there was real direction and acting going on In fairness I should mention that Malkovich has been criticized for using such an American accent for his role Why he has been singled out I am not sure In the syntax of cinema French accents are often used rather than subtitling when the characters would realistically be speaking French Frears did not follow the convention and I was not bothered by it I wondered whether an actor as plain faced as Malkovich could play a man women found so seductive as the Vicomte This too I never questioned while actually watching the film If the very most basic plot is a little too much like some of those incompetently made French sex romps that show up on late night cable everything else is first rate in this production I would give DANGEROUS LIAISONS a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0453,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,1988,One of my New Years resolutions was driven home to me over the Christmas Holidays no more TV Movie Review Programs in 1989 Actually I hadn t watched any of them for months but upon visiting my parent s house for Christmas I was reminded why I have shied away from these shows in the first place For one thing they show some of the best clips from the movie in the previews this was true for DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS at any rate secondly they don t seem to lose much sleep over whether they ve given away the plot to their viewers Roger Ebert is particularly bad about that and finally the new crop of reviewers are really awful I never thought I d say it but the woman who appears across from Rex Reed on At The Movies actually made me feel sorry for the old geek He certainly seems more reasonable when compared to his Entertainment Tonight Reject co anchor However don t get me wrong DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS is not a one high point film It carries it s load fairly evenly throughout the whole film wearing at the edges only when Steve Martin becomes a little too Jerk ish am I the only one who sees him these days and is immediately struck that someone has bobbed his nose The script is good though not great I didn t see the film with Niven and Brando that this is based on but it seems that someone updated it with competence if not inspiration Basically it s an enjoyable comedy but not something you re going to remember for more than a few hours afterwards A great discount film 3 00 value
0454,Working Girl,1988,Capsule review WORKING GIRL will probably be the film with which Melanie Griffith breaks through to stardom and genuine name recognition She plays a secretary who discovers that her boss Sigourney Weaver has stolen her idea and decides to put the idea over herself Rating low 2 Tess McGill is one of hundreds of secretaries in a Manhattan brokerage house She has gone to night school to learn the business and what she hopes will set her apart is her drive to get ahead Her company holds out the carrot to her that she may someday get a better job but it is clear from her modish mini skirted dress her excessive jewelry and makeup and her long hair that she is just not the type of person who makes it into the upper echelons One evening she discovers that her boyfriend is cheating on her and that her boss is using her and stealing her ideas for a client s investments Fed up she decides to get serious about the business She cuts her hair dresses for a higher class passes herself off as being at her boss s level and goes out to pitch her ideas for herself WORKING GIRL is the story of the elaborate ruse and the effects it has on Tess her boss and a foundering executive at the client s business Just as Tess was competent but never got any special notice until she pulled her business coup Melanie Griffith who plays Tess did not get any particular recognition until WORKING GIRL She was a familiar face who had been seen in several films NIGHT MOVES the all too rarely seen SMILE ONE ON ONE BODY DOUBLE STORMY MONDAY and THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR Her only role that really got critical attention was that of Lulu in Jonathan Demme s SOMETHING WILD I suspect that with WORKING GIRL she has made herself a recognizable star WORKING GIRL is her film even if Fox unconscionably gives her third billing Second billing goes to Sigourney Weaver as her boss and adversary Weaver plays a slick shark of an executive who uses every dirty trick including sex to fight the fight This is the first time I have seen her play a villain Top billing goes to Harrison Ford who is just barely one of the major characters of the film Perhaps as a subtle protest to the billing Sigourney Weaver has been quoted as saying I loved the idea of playing a supporting role with Melanie the star WORKING GIRL was directed by Mike Nichols with a little less bite than his films usually have Of course Nichols best loved film is THE GRADUATE and generally his films like CATCH 22 WHO S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE and SILKWOOD make a social statement The social statement here is do not exploit you fellow workers and you should fight to get ahead not unlike the moral of Colin Higgins comparable but not as good 9 TO 5 Where SILKWOOD was negative on big business WORKING GIRL concentrates on both faults and virtues Rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0455,Working Girl,1988,I can t remember the last time I saw a Mike Nichols film that reflected an ounce of the talent and promise that he showed in THE GRADUATE years and years and years ago it spoke to my parent s generation for God s sake I am happy to report that the dry spell appears to have finally ended WORKING GIRL is the kind of comedy you walk out of with an afterglow It s slick very very slick I don t think it skips a beat except maybe a few minute jiggles during the last ten minutes It s the kind of entertainment that delivers smoothly with the acting technical and music cylinders firing right when they need to It s not genius or even an outstanding work but it has so few weak points and so many good not great ones that it tends to stand out over the rest of the Christmas mudslide I was impressed with Melanie Griffith when I saw her in SOMETHING WILD but I assumed much of that was due to Demme s directing completely off the wall remark saw a repeat episode of Columbo the other night with Louis Jordan as a murdering restaurant critic that was directed by a Jonathon Demme More credit was due to her it appears Griffith has the ability to appear soft and rather vague while at the same time showing that something is clicking beneath the mascara It all appears very natural and she is without a doubt the star of the movie no doubt Ford and Weaver s agents insisted that they get top billing Ford has been better but it appears that he was asked to play Gary Cooper and he does that better than anyone else in the movies these days I admit that I like Sigourney Weaver in just about anything I get the impression that she takes a part based on whether she likes the script as opposed to whether it will enhance her career as a serious actress Can you see Sissy Spacek or Meryl Streep rotating over a bed with Bill Murray in it She romps through this one basically playing Joan Crawford and having a heck of a good time And finally Joan Cusak gets added to my list of Durn Good Character Actors Actresses a breed I hold in higher respect than most lead actors actresses Technically the film is a dream the cinematography is excellent and the segues between the parts of the films work very well indeed The shots on the ferry are particularly well done and the whole film has a texture that is reflected both in the acting and the way the scenes are photographed I am usually against popular vocalists doing the soundtracks to a film the demands of a film upon it s musical score are usually different than those placed upon a pop star s ballad Carly Simon however puts together background music that fits WORKING GIRL like a glove it pops up at just the right places and is never intrusive I hope they put out a soundtrack for this film
0456,Working Girl,1988,Melanie Griffith s name should finally become a household word after her performance in WORKING GIRL Stealing the show from the likes of Sigourney Weaver and Harrison Ford is no mean feat All three turn in impressive performances in roles which must have been fun for them to play Griffith is a secretary with brains and ambition Her new boss at the investment company is Weaver as a self centered unscrupulous climber of the corporate ladder Weaver s character is written so on the edge that it would have been an unconvincing cartoon in the hands of a lesser actress Sigourney plays it to the hilt and eventually convinces us that such a jerk could actually exist This is the second time this year she s excelled in the role of a difficult unlikable woman the first playing Dian Fossey in GORILLAS IN THE MIST Harrison Ford does his usual top notch job in a supporting role as a financier who drinks too much but manages to perform reasonably well at work anyway When Griffith gets a chance to put together a deal by pretending not to be a lowly secretary she needs his help Naturally he falls for her And why not As she succinctly describes herself while under the influence of valium and tequila I ve got a head for business and a bod for sin The thing I liked most about Griffith and her character was being reminded what a turn on brains can be After so many films and so many bimbos it s wonderful to see a gutsy intelligent woman She s not superwoman mind you and is perfectly capable of making mistakes But you get the real impression that she learns from them too She is constantly making choices between failure and the failure to take risks and between a man who buys her underwear and one who buys her a briefcase She progresses rapidly like a scrappy savvy woman Even her goofy comic relief friend Joan Cusak delightful as ever is no airhead In the final analysis WORKING GIRL is an old fashioned romantic comedy It now seems like daring hang ten film making to take the kind of risks this film does but once upon a time many movies were like that I felt almost guilty enjoying an honest to gosh happy ending where work and adventure are rewarded and avarice and dishonesty fall to satisfying retribution Having said all that perhaps I should have simply noted that WORKING GIRL is on my Top Ten list for 1988 and said check it out

Miles Copeland III and Paul Colichman Editor Earl Ghaffari Location Sound by Mark Hanes Director of Photography Jeff Zimmerman Additional Photography Julio Macat Music Supervisor Seth Kaplan for O S S Additional Music Score Simon Steele In a film industry notorious for mindless and idiotic sequels to equally moronic films it is welcome and surprising news that this particular sequel is cohesive intelligently constructed and eye opening Penelope Spheeris has directed fictional films before but she is best remembered for her 1981 documentary on the Los Angeles punk music scene at the time Her fascination with music and documentary filmmaking pays off as she devotes her talents this time around to exploring the world that heavy metal rockers and their fans have created in current LA nightclubs In this film Spheeris mixes MTV style concert footage with minimally rehearsed interviews that take place against thoroughly planned backdrops One member of KISS for instance is interviewed in a lingerie store while the other is photographed from above as he lies in a bed with three young women This technique provides more than enough realism during the interviews and also avoids the monotony typical of most concert footage While this film is a serious snapshot of the current LA metal scene it was shot between August 1987 and February 1988 the film is also reasonably entertaining to watch due to the outrageous remarks made by many of the rockers Hard core metal addicts will find it revealing to see how their idols look and behave offstage while appalled parents will undoubtedly find plenty more to be appalled at what with all the antics and attitudes on display Spheeris has certainly given a new twist to the notion of a family film That the film is able to simultaneously support numerous points of view is one of its best strengths This multifaceted approach of letting actions speak for themselves is at the heart of cinema verite filmmaking and it therefore comes as no surprise that Spheeris cites as her primary cinematic influences the giants of cinema verite Frederick Wiseman D A Pennebaker and Ricky Leacock who created and headed the film department at MIT for many years Spheeris has even included some 16mm footage which is of course the staple of documentary filmmakers But while the film is formally a documentary it differs from cinema verite in significant ways First and foremost Spheeris and cinematographer Jeff Zimmerman have shot much of their concert footage in a decidedly MTV style complete with gyrating bodies and guitars flashy camera movement unusual camera angles and rapid editing Spheeris and editor Earl Ghaffari do not let the film unfold as a surrogate MTV show however They edit the music video segments together and the whole film with an intelligence usually alien to the form The shooting and editing make clear that Spheeris is equally comfortable making documentaries or handling music videos But that leads to the second difference between cinema verite and this film which could have been a serious flaw but fortunately isn t Spheeris includes performances of Megadeth a band for whom she s previously made a video In addition one of the bands in the film Seduce was recently signed on by I R S Records which is a part of I R S World Media the production company for the film In strict cinema verite even the appearance of a conflict of interest would be unthinkable and unacceptable Happily there is no evidence whatsoever that Spheeris has compromised or otherwise adversely influenced the integrity and truthfulness of what is shown onscreen and consequently the film s relaxation of the harsh discipline demanded by cinema verite can be forgiven easily This is especially true considering that Spheeris quit her music video production company because she became dissatisfied with making commercials and that most film reviewers this one included would have had no idea of Spheeris prior involvement with the bands if the press materials had not mentioned it The third and most notable difference between the film and a typical verite documentary is that DECLINE II is in Spheeris own words funny and entertaining without being too frivolous Thus the young rockers who haven t made it yet offer some pretty outrageous comments about females success sex sexism drugs and the size of their penis One guitar player has the words Fuck the PMRC written on his guitar And a middle aged woman from the only parents group interviewed in the film not the Parents Music Resource Center makes a fool of herself when an off camera Spheeris asks her whether Ozzy Osbourne really speaks for the devil Spheeris lays that ghost to rest by immediately cutting to a shot of a plain and harmless looking Osbourne cooking breakfast in his own home where he opens his eyes wide and with an a sarcastically evil grin answers Yes to the same question Of course Osbourne doesn t get off scot free The years of jumping around on stage show their toll when Osbourne cooks for himself what seems to be a pound of bacon and can t pour orange juice into a glass without spilling much of it Even so Osbourne and the other veteran rockers in the film such as Aerosmith Alice Cooper and KISS are much more clear headed and articulate than the relative unknowns Whereas the younger set is wholly infatuated with the image and perks of stardom and is thoroughly convinced that he or she was meant to be a rock star the older rockers have been there already and have outgrown some of their more outlandish antics while still remaining hard core metal rockers But just when one gets used to this dichotomy the film takes its most serious turn when Spheeris films a thoroughly intoxicated Chris Holmes guitarist for W A S P He s happily rotting his brain cells and life away as he guzzles vodka while lying in a swimming pool while his mother steadfastly looks on from the side not saying a word Spheeris to her immense credit refuses to sensationalize or moralize She just continues asking questions from off camera probing and pressing letting the scene speak for itself It s a moment worthy of the genius of Frederick Wiseman and it is much of the reason why THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION PART II THE METAL YEARS is as successful as it is Directorial Filmography of Penelope Spheeris FD indicates feature documentary Alternate titles listed after a slash A cousin of filmmaker Costa Gavras Penelope Spheeris grew up in the suburbs of Orange County California She worked for an educational film company after graduating in 1973 from UCLA with a degree in Theatre Arts She then set up her own music video company Rock n Reel and directed videos for four years She found herself working as West Coast producer for the Saturday Night Live television show including a series of short films by comedian Albert Brooks In 1977 Brooks gave Spheeris her chance to produce her first

0458,Accidental Tourist The,1988,Capsule review Slow adaptation of the Anne Tyler best selling novel is good viewing for those already familiar with the story but may seem lethargic and perhaps a little pointless to the casual viewer Kasdan re unites Turner and Hurt Rating 2 Macon Leary is a man who never gets out of his easy chair Physically perhaps he does but mentally and emotionally he cannot face the world of the unexpected His philosophy of life is always to follow the path of least resistance Macon has all the character of a wet washrag His occupation is helping others to share the same numbed existence He writes travel books for people forced to travel but who are anxious to avoid any new experiences Macon who advises his readers never to carry anything they would be devastated to lose brings that same philosophy to everything he does in life But new experiences are coming to Macon A year ago his son died in a senseless murder Now his wife Sarah is leaving him And soon he will meet Muriel a very kookie dog trainer who has designs on both Macon s dog Edward and Macon himself For over two slow hours we watch Macon buffetted by the tides of those around him until finally he is ready to leave his easy chair and make a real decision THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST is Lawrence Kasdan s film based on Anne Tyler s beautifully textured novel of the often odd people in Macon Leary s life In THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST Kasdan re unites William Hurt and Kathleen Turner the stars of his BODY HEAT as Macon and Sarah Having seen them together before gives a sort of pre history to their relationship much like Tracy and Hepburn would have Hurt and Turner may not be readers images of the Learys but they certainly are one interpretation of the roles Oddly enough Geena Davis is too natural an actress for her role Some of the things Muriel does in the book that seem really weird Davis does so naturally that they lose much of their strangeness Yet Muriel as only the third lead is the character of most interest to the viewer Macon and Sarah are too bland really to catch the audience s imagination the way Muriel does Tyler could put some character into Macon but Hurt seems to be just sleepwalking through his role I would rate THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale but I recommend it only to people who are already familiar with the story If I had not been I might well have given the film a lower rating
0459,Beaches,1988,BEACHES is the latest presumably of a number of somewhat similar films about pairs of women who share each other s lives and develop together They share each other s good times and bad They share joys and tragedies Usually there are scenes where they turn bitchy to each other and break up their friendship in hatred only to come back to each other Usually there is emphasis on the women s sex lives This sort of film is always deep down a tribute to friendship and platonic love Example include OLD ACQUAINTANCE ENTRE NOUS TERMS OF ENDEARMENT RICH AND FAMOUS and perhaps THE TURNING POINT Gary Marshall has directed a new film along these lines BEACHES is that title a pun perhaps BEACHES is similar in a lot of ways to George Cukor s RICH AND FAMOUS right down to a score by George Delerue Though not as good a score I do not like RICH AND FAMOUS but I confess I find the title theme a stunningly beautiful piece of music and very probably the best piece of music in Delerue s distinguished career BEACHES is the story of two women and of course their long friendship C C Bloom is a brash singer actress who has lived her whole life in show business Hilary Whitney is a very upperclass Anglo Saxon Protestant from the right kind of family This is a most unlikely friendship that begins when the two are each eleven C C is played by Mayin Bialik as a child and by Bette Midler as an adult In fact of the two Bialik is the more memorable Midler plays Bette Midler and does an okay job but Bialik playing Bette Midler is a wonder to behold It is hard to believe that Bialik herself is not going to grow up to be Bette Midler so perfectly does she personify Midler s looks and mannerisms On the other hand Marcie Leeds as the young Hilary does not really resemble Barbara Hershey But then even as an adult Hilary looks only like Barbara Hershey with bad taste in lipstick Through most of the film Midler upstages Hershey and director Gary Marshall who works for co producer Midler lets her do it The result is that while Hershey is less noticeable than Midler she also does a better job of acting Midler is much more of a caricature It is Midler who sings You ve got to give a little take a little the film s theme song and moral BEACHES is a decent weepy film for those who like to cry in movies but it is less than ideal as a piece of sincere filmmaking Rate it a high 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0461,Mississippi Burning,1988,MISSISSIPPI BURNING got its general release on Martin Luther King s birthday weekend This review is posted on Martin Luther King s birthday Neither was accidental Moderator Capsule review Alan Parker director of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS THE WALL and ANGEL HEART creates a well detailed though allegedly very fictionalized account of the FBI investigation into the disappearance of three civil rights workers from Jessup Mississippi in 1964 Gene Hackman s performance is complex in a film that is violent but rewarding Rating 3 Two waterfountains side by side One has a sign saying it is for whites one says it is for colored Separate but equal Except the whites fountain is a big electrically cooled fountain the blacks fountain is a little white porcelain one like you would see in a grade school With the very first shot of MISSISSIPPI BURNING Alan Parker sets the tone for what is to come and creates a feel for the South in 1964 And what is to come is the story of an FBI investigation into the deaths of three civil rights workers that turned into an all out war between the FBI and the Ku Klux Klan Into Jessup Mississippi come two FBI agents Anderson played by Gene Hackman and Ward played by Willem Dafoe Ward is in command Anderson knows the territory and how to get things done As such they are roughly similar to the Sean Connery and Kevin Kostner characters in THE UNTOUCHABLES but in this case neither is really fully right in his approach The result is a usually quiet conflict between Anderson and Ward as they both fight the Klan and its sympathizers The script gives the greater acting opportunity to Hackman His character seems at first to be jovial and friendly almost a good old boy where Dafoe s character is flat and officious Hackman s character and his performance operate at several levels at once He has plans within plans and can be reckless and bloodthirsty in his attempts to get a job done Brad Dourif whose early career had him play mostly innocents in films like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST and RAGTIME these days usually plays vicious heavies in films like CHILD S PLAY and MISSISSIPPI BURNING Stylistically MISSISSIPPI BURNING may well have been inspired by John Sayles 1987 film MATEWAN Like Sayles Parker has created the feel of an epic inexpensively by careful choice of locale in which to shoot As in MATEWAN the story is a little too neat to be believed Both stories have the feel of an anecdotal style for mood rather than that of a docu drama a style that undermines the realism Even then the mood itself is damaged at the end by a small speech by Dafoe followed by the singing of a spiritual The photography while at times atmospheric in general is realistic and includes liberal if that is the word doses of violence realistic enough to bother some viewers Parker or screenwriter Chris Gerolmo seems intentionally to put in disorienting scenes that do not immediately make sense but which will fit into the puzzle in a few minutes In general MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a skillfully crafted piece of historical fiction just a little stronger in style than in credibility Rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0462,Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story,1987,SUPERSTAR THE KAREN CARPENTER STORY not the TV movie Director Todd Haynes Written and Produced by Todd Haynes and Cynthia Schneider Length 43 minutes color documentary The 1970 s were a time of turmoil in America the Vietnam war and the accompanying domestic unrest The 1970 s also saw the rise of feminism and other new political and religious movements In a certain figurative sense America was searching for itself i e for new symbols of itself Against the backdrop of all this turmoil Karen and Richard Carpenter performing as The Carpenters rose to great popularity with their ever so bland ever so smooth style of pop music The music of the Carpenters relied heavily on Karen s unique and very melodic voice even critics that hated their style praised Karen s voice The Carpenters had a squeaky clean image in particular Karen whose image was that of Miss Goody Two Shoes The Carpenters Karen in particular effectively became symbols of for America at the time with the induced pressures and public expectations As a symbol of America Karen was used and abused by the music industry The extreme pressures of family career public expectations all contributed to the development of her anorexia nervosa which indirectly contributed to her premature death SUPERSTAR THE KAREN CARPENTER STORY is a unique film As the film opens Karen s mother discovers Karen dead in the closet of the bedroom that her parents kept for her in their Downey suburban Los Angeles home This is one of the few live action sequences The film then shifts in time to the early 70 s where we see Karen portrayed by a brunette Barbie doll a happy teenager singing along with the radio Scenes of the early successes of the Carpenters as dramatized by the dolls are interspersed with newsreel footage of civil unrest the bombing of Cambodia and scenes from popular TV programs of the time As we see the bombs being dropped we hear the smooth comforting singing of Karen Carpenter The effect of this is an unreal juxtaposition you feel that you are detached from reality that reality is just a TV show or movie The contrast between the soft music of the Carpenters and the violence turmoil of the 70 s is jarring Continuing the film documents Karen s slide into the personal hell of anorexia nervosa We see the severe pressures put on Karen by her brother and the smothering control of her mother Background information is supplied on the condition of anorexia nervosa as is appropriate for a documentary Karen s intense inner struggle with food and laxatives some anorexics take massive doses of laxatives to purge themselves is carefully dramatized Towards the end Karen realizes that she is sick and reaches out for help This is addressed in a very dramatic scene where Karen portrayed by a doll whose face has been scraped down then repainted yielding a grotesque image tells Richard that she has anorexia The reaction of the Richard doll is to talk about contractual obligations One is left with the impression that despite Karen s grotesque death mask it is Richard that is the grotesque one The film is told from Karen s point of view and it is very sympathetic to her Karen s parents particularly her mother and brother are not treated as sympathetically They are portrayed as either using or controlling Karen while her wants and needs go unfulfilled Despite the use of Barbie dolls for actors or perhaps because of their use this film succeeds on many levels It is very touching and one is left with the feeling that Karen Carpenter s death was a terrible tragedy The film leaves one saddened at her loss The film succeeds on another level albeit unintended Cynics and anyone that hates Karen Carpenter or what she symbolized can see this film and laugh at it Because of the use of Barbie dolls there are scenes where you cannot help but laugh Additionally there are some ironic humorous twists in dramatizing the family struggle caused by Karen s self starvation there are brief flashes to scenes where a female doll Karen is receiving a spanking on her bare backside Such a scene can be explained as an illustration of the smothering parental control most anorexics must overcome Such a scene might be considered kinky for other reasons after all Karen was an adult Make no mistakes this film is definitely worth seeing The reasons for seeing it are 1 thoughtful moving tribute to a young woman who died tragically 2 novelty value How many films have you seen where all the actors are Barbie dolls 3 sardonic humor present in the movie though not intended by its creator SUPERSTAR THE KAREN CARPENTER STORY transcends the limitations of Barbie dolls and presents a very sad story in a very honest fashion I give it my highest recommendation Note this film is not in wide spread distribution at present I have included the name and address of the distribution company which is also the production company It is also questionable due to music rights whether when this film will ever turn up on cable I suggest that you encourage film festivals in your area to screen it Alternatively try to get a theatre in your area to show it as a Midnight Movie Here in Berkeley it is shown every Friday midnight along with He May Be Dead But He s Still Elvis a biting satire on the exploitation of dead stars Finally I should

0463,He May Be Dead But Hes Still Elvis,1989,This gem of a short film is a biting satire of the music business and the exploitation of dead rock stars The film begins with a commercial for the new album recorded by the dead Elvis Presley a double album that is silent no music remember he s dead It s titled Presley Comes Alive and we are exhorted to buy buy buy now now now There follows a press conference where it is announced that to counteract the drop in sales of Elvis memorabilia the promotion company Elvis Exploitation Inc has dug up his corpse The decomposing blue zombie like corpse of Elvis Presley is then unceremoniously dumped on a table at the press conference The corpse is then sent around the country on various money making schemes All this happens in the first 3 minutes of this film There follows more humor in the same vein We see scenes from a new movie starring the dead Elvis Necrophilia Hawaiian Style There s more to the film than just the above points and the ending is grotesque but extremely funny I will not spoil the film by revealing any more details The basic premise of this film is really sick It is a low budget film and it looks low budget The humor is sophomoric and sick at times Now forget what I just said and go see it This is an outrageously funny satire one of the funniest short films that I have ever seen
0464,Torch Song Trilogy,1988,Capsule review Disappointing window into the gay sex life shows a lot of the same elements as a straight sex life A film with interesting and even poignant moments but overall neither interesting nor poignant Rating low 1 Let me be clear at the outset where I am coming from on TORCH SONG TRILOGY I don t condemn the I Love you you left me I hate you I miss you you want to come back I don t want you back sort of film but it doesn t do much for me either Perhaps it is because there has not been a lot of sexual turmoil in my life but any such machinations more complex than those in CASABLANCA will almost never strike any kind of responsive chord in me I will generally find these films pretty fatuous and dull Even Woody Allen failed to pull me into MANHATTAN and TORCH SONG TRILOGY s Harvey Fierstein is no Woody Allen Originally this story was three hour long one act plays by Fierstein The International Stud Fugue in a Nursery and Widows and Children First In 1982 the three semi autobiographical plays were performed back to back as a single play TORCH SONG TRILOGY Fierstein himself starred which must have made him awfully difficult to direct How do you tell someone acting out scenes from his own life that he isn t doing it right In any case the story covers about ten years in the life of a gay man who is a female impersonator and later a playwright It is mostly about how he comes to terms with the men in his life and his mother Once again Fierstein is played by Fierstein the lovers are played by Brian Kerwin and Matthew Broderick and the mother is played by Anne Bancroft While the play was considered an insightful and honest view into gay sex life much of what we see in the film could apply to any sort of relationship that society frowns on inter racial inter class ever inter faith We are constantly aware that the characters are gay but we do not really see much of how losing a lover of the same sex is different from losing one of the opposite sex that your parents didn t like There is the added complication that you could conceivably lose one lover to another which I suppose could not happen in a set of purely straight relationships but most of the situations set up are gay people in standard situations Whenever you put four people in a house of whom three pairs have been lovers you expect problems for example There are definite problems with some of the writing One has the feeling that Fierstein is washing his family s dirty linen in public It is as if we are paying to be an audience for Fierstein giving his mother what for And some of his speeches are just a little too well formed to be off the cuff It is as if he is turning his what I should have saids into I saids Also the passage of time seems to be inadequately handled The characters talk about how they age but they do not appear to Given that this is not really a type of film I think I can fairly judge I would rate TORCH SONG TRILOGY a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0465,Mississippi Burning,1988,Imagine if you will One night three men are driving in a car and three cars begin to follow them The men are worried then they see a police light and they pull over wondering what they had done The officer gets out and walks over to the stopped car The driver rolls down the window then the officer shoots him point blank in the head The officers then proceed to kill the other two men in the car Pretty gruesome story isn t it Well what you just read happens to be the opening scene for the film MISSISSIPPI BURNING As horrifying as that story is it is only a small fraction of all the racial fear and hatred that existed in the small town of Jessup Mississippi in 1964 Those three men it just so happens were civil rights activists Two FBI agents arrive in Jessup to investigate the disappearance of the three activists After meeting the sheriff they inquire about the three men The sheriff tells them a story that they don t believe The two agents Ward and Anderson played superbly by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman respectively decide to follow bureau procedure and question some residents of Jessup The agents are surprised to see that the town is so racially segregated All the residents that they question either choose to remain tight lipped or have no information to give They get a break in the investigation when they find some evidence that might lead to the whereabouts of the men Agent Ward orders over 200 agents to the small town to help conduct a search party While Ward is searching Anderson is trying to get any information out of the deputy s wife Agents Ward and Anderson are amazed when they learn that the head leader of the local charter of the Ku KLux Klan has arrived for a meeting with the police department and other local residents of Jessup The constant prying that the FBI agents are doing infuriates some of the members of the police department and some other residents They decide to take out their rage on the colored residents of the town We see the angry townspeople burn down other persons homes kidnap them and beat some of them up and we also see them hang a man Meanwhile the deputy s wife just cannot take any more of this cruelty and tells some important information to agent Anderson It is when they beat up the deputy s wife that agent Anderson wants to go after them his own way After a scuffle between the two agents Anderson gets Ward s authority to try to do it his way Agent Anderson then proceeds to use iron fisted methods to get some of the residents to give them the answers that they are searching for These methods work brilliantly and bring the film to a great conclusion This is a very powerful movie there were some scenes in the movie that were so terrible that you could not help but feel somewhat sick inside I believe that MISSISSIPPI BURNING has to be the favorite for this year s Academy Award for Best Picture I cannot remember a more stronger or emotional movie this year I guarantee those film fans who make the effort to see this movie will not regret it It is a captivating bit of filmmaking expertly capturing a feeling of strong racial prejudice that should not be lost This movie shows not only how far this country has come in the past 25 years but how far race relations have yet to progress Rating 4
0466,As Time Goes by,1988,I like things that play around with time THE TIME TUNNEL remember that BACK TO THE FUTURE even Graeme Murphy s choreography for the SYDNEY DANCE COMPANY So when a film like AS TIME GOES BY comes along I go and see it I m glad I did Billed as a sci fi comedy it has all the right ingredients for a good movie The idea of bringing together a weird mix of characters is a small outback town lends itself to some good situation comedy and it works well The script by Barry Peak progresses along an unpredictable path with a few interesting and comic twists thrown in The pace though not frantic would you expect it to be in a small outback town never drops and I often thought what was going to be next Mike Nique Needles is the main character a surfer who ends up in a small country town This lends itself to a small cast which is great for a couple of reasons Cost this is a small budget film Development no character is redundant Simple the simplicity of the plot does not complicate matters it allows the film to exploit the comedy available The acting is good and Max Gillies does a great job displaying his vocal dexterity as one of the aliens
0467,January Man,1989,I saw THE JANUARY MAN Friday night before I read any reviews USA TODAY gave it one star out of four and during the weekend I saw Gene Roger Rex Dixie all panned it All these critics had some valid points It does have more subplots than it can support At times it can get pretty incredible especially the last twenty minutes which reminded me of the Keystone Cops But it is not a horrible film I didn t leave the theatre wishing I d stayed home and watched TV A lot of this movie is really interesting In the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the movie we learn the following That s what we know at the beginning of the movie Unfortunately that s about all we know at the end of the movie None of the subplots are developed To make matters worse other subplots are introduced There is another romance A profile is developed of the killer that makes him look like a cross between the rain man and Ted Bundy All interesting stuff but the trouble is the makers of this film just use it to tease the audience instead of resolving anything I certainly understand why some people call this a bad movie But I think it might be more accurate to say that it is a good movie that nobody got around to finishing A lot of the problems with it could have been with a small amount of rewriting and adding half an hour to forty five minutes worth of footage to explain things Which leads me to a theory I have I have the feeling that somebody high up said that this movie had to be out by January as kind of a gimmick to draw attention to it and folks on the creative end were forced to release a substandard product That might not be the real explanation but I do get the feeling that this was a rush job I d give this movie two and a half stars out of four for good acting and some good ideas If you want to see a movie that tries to do the same things this movie does and succeeds go rent FIVE CORNERS a marvelous little sleeper that was scripted by John Patrick Shanley the screenwriter for this movie and for MOONSTRUCK
0468,Dao ma zei,1986,Most films even the excellent ones fit squarely into an existing tradition of cinema You have seen the same sort of thing before even though the approach and many aspects of the film are novel Once in a great while more often for adventurous movie goers than for those who see only Hollywood films you come across something that is really new and different Even less often it is new different and good Such a film is like a revelation The first Bergman movie one sees or the first Tarkovsky or the first Fellini can be this sort of experience a sudden broadening of one s private definition of what film is For me HORSE THIEF is such an experience I have seen new Chinese films before three or four of them and while they were largely good films they were rather conventional Typically they seemed to combine filmmaking techniques from the classic Hollywood era with some of the less innovative elements of Japanese cinema filtered through a residual layer of Communist socialist political thought Though the political content has apparently decreased dramatically in the last decade HORSE THIEF is something entirely different Nothing in the film suggests leftovers from the 1930 s or borrowed aesthetics or Communist propaganda Vital stunning originality is its mark The story is set in Tibet in the 1920 s though it might as well be the 16th century for all the effect that the modern age has on the area A poor man must steal horses to support his wife and young adored son Despite his disreputable occupation he piously contributes the bulk of his spoils to the temple From this simple situation a very minimal plot propels the film But HORSE THIEF is not a film to watch for plot Rather the film presents a slow careful revelation of the difficult lives of Tibetans with emphasis on the vital role of religion in their lives Practically every action taken by anyone in HORSE THIEF is directly related either to survival or religion The land is harsh and only constant effort permits people to live there The characters only take time away from this struggle to worship their god Gradually as one watches the film one realizes that the constant attention to worship is an intimate part of survival Life is so hard that only sacred intervention can save the characters from death Every turn of the prayer wheel every ceremonial dance every sacrifice and devotion has the practical aim of supplicating for the divine intervention that alone can ensure survival The greatest disasters of the film stem from unluckily angering the deity One of the most surprising things about this film from the People s Republic of China is that the peasants attitudes about religion are taken completely at face value Perhaps Buddha does not exist and does not intervene in the daily lives of Tibetans but HORSE THIEF offers no evidence that he doesn t and seems to suggest that he does But even the unexpected theme of HORSE THIEF does not capture the importance of this film The photography and direction are the film s most innovative aspects Tian Zhuangzhuang the director has a unique visual style favoring long static shots The typical presentation of long scenes in most movies is to break the scene into several shots each taken from a different angle at a different distance from the subject Often the only reason for breaking up the scene is visual interest The director fears that we will be bored by a single static shot covering several minutes so he jazzes the scene up Taken to the extreme this approach yields MTV style films in which no shot lingers more than a few seconds editing as rock and roll Only daring directors will let their camera be still and then only on the most interesting subjects as a calculated effect Tian takes a vastly different approach He treats the camera as a distant viewer almost godlike in its unblinking perspective A shot will last for several minutes with the action taking place far beyond the foreground Camera movement is mostly used to quietly slowly follow a moving subject and cutting within a scene is rare But Tian is not indulging in cinematic primitivism For one thing the photography is ravishingly beautiful capturing the awesome splendor of Tibet and the rich colors of its culture More tellingly several sequences show that Tian is intimately familiar with more complex uses of the camera His sparing use of movement and editing allows him to extract tremendous impact from the same devices that other directors use routinely A sudden split second cut registers surprise and shock as it never could in a typical film A montage of overlaid images beautifully suggests a blurring of the lines between the everyday and the mystical A tracking shot following two characters as they walk in circles around a building meshes beautifully with an old woman s use of a prayer wheel throughout the scene If HORSE THIEF is reminiscent of any other film it must be 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY That film too made great use of lengthy shots deliberate pacing and exquisitely calculated technical flashes The masterful use of wide screen is also a common element between the films But Kubrick either intentionally or accidentally was forced to sacrifice all humanity from his film His characters were largely flat and lifeless The characters in HORSE THIEF are vitally real with none of their humanity drained by the distant perspective of the camera HORSE THIEF is decidedly not a film for everyone It moves slowly the plot is simple and the director demands effort from the viewer Everything you need to know is shown or told but the viewer must pay attention to the film for nothing will be repeated solely for clarity Tian cares less about explaining to the inattentive than he does about achieving his vision For serious lovers of film HORSE THIEF must not be missed and must be seen on a movie screen A videocassette could not possible capture the magic of this film and on a purely mundane level would chop off the vital edges of the widescreen images I would not be surprised if a year from now I considered HORSE THIEF to be the best film I saw in 1989

0470,Talk Radio,1988,TALK RADIO which stars Eric Bogosian is loosely constructed around the story of Denver talk show host Alan Berg who was murdered by members of a Neo Nazi group Like many radio talk shows themselves the characters are a study in extremes Bogosian s character Barry Champlain is an abusive personality on the air and in his personal life and his show attracts a mixture of alienated confused and at times even criminal characters calling in Champlain treats the large portion of them with a healthy dose of sarcastic abuse The basic premise is that the show is phenomenally popular so much so that an offer is made to take the show national while still having it broadcast from its Dallas Ft Worth location The action takes place largely during several days prior to the national syndication in which the show is being evaluated The best way to describe the film is unrelenting Bogosian only turns down the searing anger of the character during periods of remorse but otherwise it is full speed ahead with only occasional treatment of callers and the situations they present with more than sarcasm or disdain The basic premise seems to be if you like the show you re a phony because you re trying to be nice if you hate it you have no taste In effect there s no way to win with Barry Champlain as both his ex wife Ellen and his new lover discover However neither Ellen nor Champlain s new lover are played with sufficient depth to give them much cinematic weight This places the spotlight firmly on Bogosian which gives the film its black and white cast For example while one might give Ellen the benefit of the doubt in marrying Champlain in the first place for her to entertain thoughts of going back to him and risk her new marriage for those we need something more than the ditsy performance given us Like the character Barry Champlain this movie would have been somewhat better if the star had been willing to step back and let someone else on the stage for a while Playing supporting actress to Bogosian in this role is a little like playing Bambi against Godzilla in Bambi meets Godzilla an underground cartoon with a thoroughly predictable ending Unfortunately TALK RADIO is somewhat too predictable as well
0471,Gor,1988,The author of this review wishes to remain anonymous Can you blame her him Moderator Twenty one novels or so ago a chap named John Norman starting writing a series of Edgar Rice Burroughs style adventure novels set on a counter Earth opposite the Earth on the other side of the Sun They had titles like TARNSMAN OF GOR and RAIDERS OF GOR Much as in ERB s classic Mars series the Goreans possessed an unlikely mix of high and low technology combining spaceships and perfect birth control with swords A relatively minor part of the background was slavery as is frequently the case with hack work adventure novels This continued for five novels or so and Mr Norman achieved some recognition as a writer of more or less enjoyable escapist adventure literature At some point about the fifth novel what had been a few lines describing a slave being chained whipped or branded became a few pages and then an entire chapter The Gor series became an open secret the only source of soft porn S M material at Waldenbooks Fortunately for Mr Norman Falwell and Robinson have for some reason neglected his publisher DAW Books and the owner of DAW is apparently well pleased with the Gor series Rumor has it that the Gor profits more or less pay for all the innovative low profit high quality SF published by DAW Books The recent Gor movie must be viewed against this background Some may have hoped for a decent action adventure film while others for a bevy of beauties in chains Both are sadly disappointed The Gor film is to quote one critic a travesty of a mediocrity Gone are the SF fantasy elements of the novels spaceships alien priest kings tarns etc Instead a magical stone transports our hero Tarl Cabot to Gor where he quickly becomes an amazing fighter in spite of a total lack of prior experience The plot vaguely resembles some elements of the novels but only to a point There are some dancing slaves but nothing like the preponderance in the novels There is a plot but it makes even less sense than that found in the novels and at the end Cabot is returned to Earth via the homestone where he knocks down a beach bully type with his new found skills My personal nomination for the most gratuitous scene involves the main characters sneaking though a cave They come upon a blond woman in chains One character says to another She has the dread disease narcosis Terrible isn t it or words to that effect They move on and nothing further is said of the dread disease Lest you get the idea that although this is a bad film with a silly plot these flaws are compensated for by the presence of hordes of nubile slaves I feel compelled to point out that this is the one of a very small number of such scenes in the entire movie Did I mention the poor acting No Well there is plenty of bad acting as well There is also a sequel strongly but illogically hinted at by the final scene of the movie This is definitely a 2 movie verging on 3
0472,Outlaw of Gor,1989,Having had this film inflicted on me over the Christmas holidays I feel obliged to inflict it on the rest of you This film is the sequel to GOR and was filmed at the same time to save money Anyone familiar with the original novel may like to try to spot similarities between it and the film There are lots of spoilers in the story synopsis below and I make no apologies for them The story opens with someone who must have been the top graduate of Nerd Academy trying to pick up women in a bar For reasons best known only to the director he is there with his good friend and colleague Tarl Cabot who doesn t seem interested in women and decides to leave As Tarl and the Nerd drive away from the bar Tarl s crystal ring starts flashing a green light and the car s occupants are transported By the mystical power of the homestone to the desert planet of Gor I was just cleaning it says the priest who summoned them Tarl and friend are ambushed by a group of sword wielding horsemen within seconds of arriving in the desert The inhabitants of Gor seem to be peculiarly unsuited to physical violence This one unarmed man on foot takes on the whole band of seasoned villains and by the rather strange method of sticking a captured sword under their armpits manages to kill them all This is even more incredible a feat given the precision of swordsmanship the villains must have possessed to make long straight cuts in Tarl s clothes without scratching him Next we get to the magnificent city of Ko Ro Bah It has a population of not more than fifty or sixty if you count the horses and goats The entire city consists of a half dozen or so tents and a number of cheap plaster columns arranged in a semicircle facing a combination pyramid and tunnel entrance The entrance leads at different times in the film into the Imperial palace into the dungeons or into the mines The mine with a few people chained to the walls also doubles as the dungeon In the city lives Menelanus King of Ko Ro Bah with his new bride Lara Tarl and friend are welcomed back and Tarl is re united with Talena After the obligatory banquet scene Menelanus and Lara retire for the night Lara poisons Menelanus and just for good measure stabs him as well Tarl who was just about to visit Menelanus and ask for Talena s hand in marriage finds the body and removes the knife Just then the guards arrive and Tarl has to escape the city accompanied only by a midget warrior who was with him when he found the body After wandering for days in a sandpit rejected by Dr Who and Blake s Seven and not having the sense to ask the frequently visible camera crew for water they come on a party of slavers attacking a small group of people As I noted above the inhabitants of Gor are very strange people To escape from the slavers this small group of Goreans run in little circles to make themselves look like a larger group of Goreans and frighten the slavers away This tactic doesn t work very well and shortly the newly acquired slaves are forced to suffer the ultimate humiliation They are tied in a line and marched off wearing toilet seats round their necks It doesn t stop and we reach the slavers camp A dozen tents surrounding portable ornamental fishpond from which Tarl and the midget can drink No one even notices them They steal clothes Meat for the midget and fruit for Tarl Tarl is a vegetarian Tarl then attacks the slave auction with his cry of This must stop He steals horses weapons and one of the newly acquired slaves He kills a few villains sets fire to the tents and rides out of the remains of the camp The head villain decides to just let him leave There is then a sequence where Tarl tries to explain to his new companion that he is not her master that he has set her free He goes on to explain how much he hates all forms of slavery and how Menelanus had been trying to abolish slavery from the planet The new self proclaimed Queen of Ko Ro Bah Lara has reinstated slavery because she has to get someone to work the mine it keeps caving in Tarl the Midget and the freed slave have been followed from Ko Ro Bah by a hunter He walks into their camp that night when they are asleep frees their horses and ties them up He then marches them on foot back to Ko Ro Bah and collects his reward Talena has meanwhile been forced to fight a number of opponents for her freedom She has obviously been taking lessons from Tarl She knows the trick of sticking your sword under your opponent s left arm too After a little gratuitous violence in the dungeons Tarl is led into the arena in front of the pyramid tunnel to face the Queen s champions Two large bald men 250lb each and not an ounce of muscle on either After a little more sword waving and spear throwing Queen Lara is killed and the bad guys are defeated The Nerd He was thrown in the dungeon when Lara proclaimed herself queen spent most of the film there and is transported back to Earth when the Homestone decides to start flashing at the end of the film Tarl isn t wearing his crystal ring be is in the royal honeymoon bed with Talena so he isn t sent back I may have given the impression above that the film is being played for laughs It isn t I may have given the impression that the film is worth seeing simply because it is so bad It isn t This film is one of those Supreme turkeys which are truly awful but not quite bad enough for promotion to the coveted Golden Turkey status I didn t think it possible but I would recommend the original John Norman book in preference to the film but I wouldn t go as far as recommending the rest of the series I do have my limits you know Now has anyone else seen the original film that this is a sequel to and is willing to confess to it
0473,Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey The,1988,This movie has been playing for a few months but I have only just caught up with it It is a New Zealand Australian co production but it is but no means typical of the films that have been produced in this part of the world over the last decade The feel of the movie is more European even though half of the film is seen to take place in New Zealand As a winner of 6 Australian Film Awards it is bound to get a showing outside of NZ Australia Without giving away more than the flyer advertising the movie it is set in England 1348 the year of the Black Death The Navigator is a boy who has visions dreams He dreams of tunnelling through to the other side of the Earth to a Great Cathedral to save his village from the Black Death The movie follows this voyage and when they emerge at the other side of the Earth it is New Zealand And it is 1988 Yes another time movie No the movie is not medieval meets the 20th Century Far from it It deals with the people and their determination to achieve their goal the goal set by the young boy The fact that they are in New Zealand had nothing to do with it One of the skillful parts of the movie is the way in which the modern day cities are presented with the same medieval feel as the village back home 1988 has its own terrors cars highways its own Black Death and all things familiar to the religion back home The camera angles used in the modern towns do not give any detail they just add effect And some of the camera effects are good the desolate snow covered landscape is all the more desolate for the use of black and white Top marks for the cinematography I came out of the theatre feeling that I had shared in an adventure not just watched one And the music by Davood Tabrizi with a feel similar to THE MISSION added all the more
0474,Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! The,1988,Movie Review 1 A Fish Called Wanda R Comedy This movie has to be the funniest comedy I have seen in 4 or 5 years The movie stars John Cleese of Monty Python fame Jaime Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline A FISH CALLED WANDA has sick jokes dirty jokes dead animal jokes and a very good plot The plot concerns a gang of thieves who decide to rob a bank of 10 million dollars worth of diamonds and jewels All of the hoodlums get away from the police from the robbery except one of them Deciding he will probably go to jail never to see his reward the caught hoodlum hides the loot in a train station pay locker and hides the key to the locker in the treasure chest located in the bottom of a goldfish aquarium Never mind that all of the above occurs in the first ten minutes of the film John Cleese is hilarious as the stiff necked attorney who ends up getting involved in this mess Jaime Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline as two of the thieves portray a strange sister brother relationship This wicked comedy is funny funny funny The movie will soon be available on video It has played for a long run in many movie theatres I rate it 1 2 out of a possible four Mini Reviews The Naked Gun PG Comedy The movie stars Leslie Nielsen in an Airplane type comedy filled with slapstick sight sags and generally silly humor Priscilla Presley plays the femme fatale to Nielsen s attempted straight face approach to his role as a bumbling police detective about to solve his biggest case The movie has cameos from actors and sports heros including O J Simpson Reggie Jackson and a look alike to Queen Elizabeth This movie though is not half as funny as A FISH CALLED WANDA THE NAKED GUN is still worth a see I rate THE NAKED GUN out of four
0475,Marusa no onna,1987,Cast Nobuko Miyamoto Tsutomu Yamazaki Masahiko Tsugawa Hideo Murota Shuji Otaki Daisuke Yamashita Shinsuke Ashida Keiju Kobayashi Mariko Okada Kiriko Shimizu Kazuyo Matsui Yasuo Daichi Kinzo Sakura Hajime Asoh Shiro Ito Eitaro Ozawa Credits Written and Directed by Juzo Itami Produced by Yasushi Tamaoki and Seigo Hosogoe Director of Photography Yonezo Maeda Edited by Akira Suzuki Music by Toshiyuki Honda Art Direction by Shuji Nakamura Lighting by Akio Katsura Recording by Osamu Onodera The rise of Juzo Itami has been nothing less than meteoric In four short years and three films he has become perhaps the best known Japanese film director in the West since Akira Kurosawa After taking a close look at death in OSOSHIKI THE FUNERAL 1984 and at sex and food in TAMPOPO 1986 he strikes again with MARUSA NO ONNA a film that mirrors and satirizes another universal theme taxes But the Japanese version of taxation is far removed from what most Americans think of as taxes In Japan as an opening title points out tax rates can be as high as 80 and consequently people of all economic backgrounds cheat on their taxes as a matter of routine And the lengths to which the national tax police Marusa goes to enforce the tax laws make IRS tactics seem like peaches and cream in comparison Itami says he became interested in taxes after almost all the earnings from OSOSHIKI had been snatched away as income tax Accordingly he decided to make a film about how Marusa operates and decided to use the stars of his first two films in his latest film Nobuko Miyamoto plays the lead role of Ryoko Itakura a freckled and ambitious tax inspector who singlemindedly works her way up from mom and pop grocers to the big time real estate tycoons and love hotel adult hotels owners She tries early on to audit one such big fish Hideki Gondo Tsutomu Yamazaki whose skill at hiding his income is more than a match for her limited authority as an auditor So the film skips forward about six months or so when Ryoko is promoted to a full fledged tax inspector And that s when the real fun begins The comedic moments stem mostly from the extraordinary measures that citizens use to cheat on their taxes To the Japanese shown in the film nothing is sacred in the pursuit of another yen They make false loans to friends bribe politicians and even bury cash in jars containing ashes of the dead One woman tries to swallow an incriminating document as the tax collectors close in They have to hold her nose shut in order to force her mouth open It s all a huge game and everyone takes part from the servants to the wives and mistresses As one video arcade owner comments after his tears win him a slight reprieve from Ryoko I d cry all day to save a million What s also remarkable is the equally relentless drive of the tax agents to ferret out the hidden incomes and exaggerated expenses The tax inspectors are legally sanctioned Mission Impossible types who employ extensive command centers to coordinate raids stay on duty for three or four days at a stretch and use all sorts of high tech surveillance techniques to glean their targets real income Typical of their thoroughness is a scene in which an agent sticks his foot in the doorway to keep Gondo s mistress from slamming shut the door After she starts beating on his shoe with a heavy object he casually says Ma am they re safety shoes used in a factory Even a truck couldn t crush them But on a more serious level nothing seems to be sacred to these inspectors On one of Ryoko s first assignments as inspector the agents strongly suspect a woman of having hidden a safe deposit box key within her bra They ask Ryoko to search her but the woman takes off her clothes leans backwards and cries Women have another hiding place Don t you want to search it too Of course the woman is overacting to play on the agents sympathies but the point is that if Ryoko hadn t just then found the key under the kitchen sink the agents probably would have indeed searched her body thoroughly Itami s satire is rooted in showing how easily both officials and citizens tacitly agree to transgress social and privacy limits for the sake of money Because everyone is probably guilty most investigations in the film turn out similarly It s not until the very last scene appropriately filmed at the top of an empty stadium overlooking the city that Ryoko and Gondo step back to take the longer view of the tax rat race Itami ends the scene and the film with a modern day variant of the classic tradition of hara kiri making it especially poignant and appropriate to the Japan of today Itami s cinematic realization of his script is most noteworthy for the excellent acting by both Miyamoto Itami s wife in real life and Yamazaki Their performances are much more Western than in either of Itami s previous films In fact Miyamoto told The New York Times that because The few women inspectors in Japan do not behave like Ryoko I had to look to Americans and specifically Peter Falk s Columbo for inspiration The stars acting makes up for the annoyingly inconsistent shot composition by Itami and cinematographer Yonezo Maeda who either have forgotten how to look through the camera s viewfinder or just can t make up their minds whether to shoot in 1 33 or 1 66 aspect ratio Other technical production values are better to good but none particularly stand out even upon a second viewing Ultimately Itami s film most resembles American films like BROADCAST NEWS Both have round and interesting characters both are roughly equal in entertainment value both explore themes taxes television news that resonate deeply with their respective societies and both are more witty than full of belly laughs MARUSA NO ONNA however was far more successful in its native country It swept the Japanese Academy Awards and became the fourth highest grossing film in Japan in 1987 MARUSA NO ONNA isn t a great film from either the standpoint of comedy or cinematic accomplishment It doesn t for example equal Itami s success with OSOSHIKI which remains his best work to date But Itami s latest offering does confirm his reign among Japanese filmmakers known in the West as the director most in tune with contemporary social realities His willingness to explore and criticize those realities is at the heart of his film s success Directorial filmography of Juzo Itami Juzo Itami 56 years old is the son of Mansaku Itami an early Japanese film director Initially a commercial artist Juzo Itami became an actor and appeared in films directed by Nicolas Ray Richard Brooks Kon Ichikawa and Yoshimitsu Morita and others Itami decided to become a director at age 50 because he became too impatient waiting for good acting roles
0476,Her Alibi,1989,Capsule review Bruce Beresford BREAKER MORANT TENDER MERCIES turns his hand to a light comedy mystery whose most severe false steps are when it strays into slapstick The mystery is predictable Rating 1 Australian director Bruce Beresford is not really someone known for light comedy The major films he is known for are DON S PARTY 1976 THE MONEY MOVERS 1978 BREAKER MORANT 1980 and TENDER MERCIES 1982 That is a pretty somber set of films with the possible exception of parts of DON S PARTY He certainly is not the first director you would expect to see doing a light romantic comedy mystery but that is just what he is doing in HER ALIBI HER ALIBI does not actually start as a light comedy The police find a murder victim stabbed to death with a pair of scissors and Frank Polito played by James Farentino is investigating We are also introduced to Philip Blackwood played by Tom Selleck a mystery writer with a series of eight or so popular mysteries to his name And eight was about the number of stories he had to tell For four years he has been trying to squeeze out another without success Then he sees Nina a beautiful Romanian woman on trial for murder and decides to get involved by telling the police that she was with him at the time of the murder Do not try this trick at home boys and girls Polito knows he is lying and warns him that if she murders Blackwood the alibi can never be questioned Blackwood convinces Nina to stay at his house but he is torn between infatuation and suspicion Nina is played by the svelte Paulina Porizkova HER ALIBI also features several familiar actors in roles that less familiar actors could have easily filled But it is still enjoyable to see the likes of the durable William Daniels THE GRADUATE television s CAPTAIN NEMO Tess Harper Joan Copeland and the ever sinister Hurd Hatfield THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY Beresford has a deft hand with drama but his occasional lapses into slapstick undermine the mood of the film and are neither likable nor believable Colin Higgins transitions in the comparable FOUL PLAY were handled much more smoothly Beresford does manage to turn an impromptu haircut into an extremely sensual sequence which is a little surprising considering haircuts I mean Another and unfortunately larger sequence involving a cat is merely a dramatization of an old joke HER ALIBI is a pleasant lightweight piece of entertainment Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale FYI One of my best friends is Romanian The Romanian spoken in this film has the right words but is still barely recognizable as Romanian
0477,Winds of Change,1978,Director Ivo Dvorak Sweden Swedish w English subtitles 1975 85 minutes This film is an adaptation of the story by Franz Kafka The film centers on Gregor a young man who goes to bed one night only to discover the next morning that a metamorphosis has occurred and he has turned into a giant cockroach The term giant cockroach here refers to a cockroach that is roughly the size of a man The metamorphosis of Gregor into a cockroach occurs at the beginning of the film the remainder of the story film centers on how Gregor and his family cope with this unusual event Through flashbacks we learn about Gregor s life before the metamorphosis We learn that Gregor was a timid salesman for a fabric company a devoted son who supports his parents and sister The thoughts of Gregor the cockroach are told via narration The unique situation facing Gregor as he begins his new life as a cockroach coupled with his bittersweet memories of the past provide ample opportunities for sarcastic humor and social comment An example of this is a flashback in Gregor s memory to when he was in a group of salesmen being threatened of the dangers of embezzlement against the firm The head clerk calmly says that embezzlement is the worst crime of all a crime against the firm worse than fornication worse than intercourse with cows Later in the film there is an incident when Gregor the cockroach gets out of his room while the furniture is being removed His father throws an apple at him to get him back into the room However it turns out that the apple cripples him Because of this he is no longer locked in his room the door to his room is left open This so pleases Gregor who is hungry for human contact that he delivers a poetic poignant soliloquy in praise of the apple that is rotting in his back After all no one dares remove the apple The flashbacks in the film and current scenes involving only Gregor s family are in full color Most of the scenes involving only the cockroach are in what appears to be tinted black white or color filtered to be nearly black and white The cockroach and cockroach effects are OK but not up to current standards of special effects I would describe the effects as better than the guy in a rubber suit a la Dr Who or Japanese monster flicks genre but not as good as ALIEN or ROBOCOP There are many things to like in this film The sarcastic social wit it expresses is very funny at times It is a surrealistic story of alienation rejection and despair If my memory is correct it is a relatively accurate adaptation of the original story by Kafka apologies if I m wrong it has been about 18 years since I read the story Finally if my information is correct it is the only film version available However the story unfolds at a very slow pace It is essentially a psychological story with very little action The story is interesting but far from gripping Accordingly I recommend the film only to fans of the original story and of course to anyone that loves cockroaches Overall evaluation of the film fair
0478,Fly II The,1989,This seems to be the day for bug reviews Moderator In 1958 Twentieth Century Fox released THE FLY based on the story of the same name that had appeared the year before in PLAYBOY As they would later do with STAR WARS they assumed that THE FLY would be a quick summer film for the kids and would soon be forgotten Instead it was their top moneymaker of the year Later they made the first of two sequels RETURN OF THE FLY about the son of the tragic hero of the first film also being transformed Three years ago Mel Brooks Brooksfilm production company and Fox made a non remake remake of THE FLY directed by David Cronenberg It was successful so with the inevitability of history repeating itself Brooksfilm and Fox have made a sequel about a son following in all six of his father s footsteps Since RETURN OF THE FLY was already used and PUPA OF THE FLY is hard to say they have called it THE FLY II Technically this is not a teenage sequel since Martin Brundle played by Eric Stoltz wearing more makeup than he did in MASK grows up very quickly and only looks sounds and acts like a teenager He is really only five years old but a very mature five years old In fact he is not only mature enough to have a sophisticated adult relationship including sex with a woman who cannot tell she is making love to a five year old Beth Logan played by Daphne Zuniga little Brundle has also become a computer hacker and genetic scientist par excellence This prodigious brilliance is apparently the result of a skillful blending of the genes of a brilliant scientist a science magazine writer and a horsefly He also seems to have inherited a love of dogs from his insect parentage Dogs are very nice to flies and often make them dinner Now suddenly after five years of at least looking normal Martin is being taken over by the fly genes he inherited Of course his genes seem to be all he was allowed to inherit as he is unknowingly kept prisoner by Bartok Industries which in Martin s father s day seemed to have a very nice hands off policy on their workers efforts but which in the intervening five years has become Cruelty Incorporated performing vicious experiments on animals and ignoring the human rights of their employees Yes we have a genuine teenage sequel with sensitive smart teens one of whom is only five years old and nasty stupid vicious adults Like THE FLY I THE FLY II is a somber dark film literally and figuratively Like THE FLY I it has one or two ideas mixed in with liberal doses of balderdash You can also see more of anything that went over big in the first film There are lots of gore effects Little Fly seems to have his father s habit of shattering his way straight through panes of glass And in the grand tradition of sequels the main continuing character was one of the least interesting characters in the original In this case it is Stethis the publisher played by John Getz Admittedly we do get flashes of Martin s two human parents The actor who played the fly parent tragically died before the sequel was made if I know my entomology A Gina Davis non lookalike we see scream on an operating table and die We do actually see a tape of Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle claiming he designed the transporter reconstructor to be creative in the way it rebuilds things Creative That was the word he used Right Oh and there is an in joke One of the characters is reading THE SHAPE OF RAGE a study of the films of David Cronenberg the director of THE FLY I This is one of those films you can tell is in trouble just by reading the credits Four people worked on the script always a bad sign and even worse since two have the same last name Then there is the fact that the special effects were created and designed by Chris Walas Inc Why does that sound bad Because the film was directed by Chris Walas that s why The science of THE FLY II could have been interesting combining aspects of modern genetics and computer science The plot involves both gene splicing and the first reference I have seen on the screen to computer worms But the science is bad and uses dramatic license rather than any knowledge of the field The science is tailored to the plot and the special effects rather than the reverse The creature that Martin mutates into has little to do with a human or a fly And then the idea that the fly genes would save all their disfiguring effects until Martin is grown up seems absurd and the idea that the fly DNA and the human DNA would combine for a viable living creature is a little hard to believe All told this is a disappointing sequel to Cronenberg s THE FLY Rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0479,Fly II The,1989,And yet another bug review isd this a trend Moderator David Cronenberg s remake of THE FLY is a tough act to follow Chris Walas who did the creature effects had some big shoes to fill when he stepped in as the director of THE FLY II Imagine my surprise to find that the sequel is actually pretty good Walas pretty much assumes that you ve seen the previous film If you haven t go out and rent it first I m not spoiling much by revealing that this story centers on Martin Brundle son of Seth Brundle Brundlefly He is raised by Mr Bartok of Bartok Industries read Big Evil Corporation one of the trite formula things about the story that the movie none the less manages to overcome and his scientific henchpersons Due to young Martin s unique parentage his growth is rather accelerated In fact by the time he s five years old he looks like Eric Stolz Martin learns very quickly He has to Besides taking over his father s work on teleportation he learns lessons about love and deceit which set the stage for the retribution finale an ending quite unlike that of THE FLY The philosophy in this movie isn t as deep as its original but Stolz performance is almost in the same league as Goldblum s which is a very good league indeed Walas displays a very fine visual sense in this film Even the parts that are hard to look at are pretty in their way if you know what I mean My guess is that as a first time director Walas made Coverage his middle name and shot tons of footage The edited result moves along at a very quick pace Even the drawn out scenes required in this sort of film are shorter than I ve ever seen them I enjoyed the editorial style of the movie even if a couple of scenes seemed to show up too quickly It all fit with Martin s character in the end The best way to see this film is in a theatre with lots of young women There s something about their screams that really rounds out the sound track That should warn you that when an effects man takes over there are lots of effects Mind you they re very very good One or two of them were gratuitous messages to other effects men but by and large they serve the story well If you are particularly susceptible to goop and glop you should either stay away or plan on watching a lot with your eyes closed THE FLY II isn t for everybody but if you think it might be your cup of tea you should check it out
0480,True Believer,1989,For the last ten year s James Woods character in TRUE BELIEVER has been on the emotional skids He s one of the most famous 1960s lawyers who made a name for himself defending the little people against companies and governments But over the years fewer and fewer of the people he defended were innocent so that when a young lawyer played by Robert Downey Jr who has come to New York with the intention of making Woods his mentor he finds a jaded disillusioned man with much of the skill but little of the idealism of his glory days making a living defending drug dealers Two things happen which begin to wake Woods out of his stupor one is Downey s character who is becoming a something of a Jimminy Cricket conscience to him while the other is the case of a convict played by Yuji Okumoto who says he was sentenced for a murder he never committed Woods is initially cynical but begins to see parallels between his client s eight years of imprisonment and his own decline But is his client telling the truth There are some rather inexplicable mysteries about the gang shooting that sent Okumoto s character to prison and ironically for Woods who has been using conspiracy as a plea for his clients for years an organized resistance to releasing his client from prison centering on the Manhattan District Attorney s decision to prosecute the reopening of the case the D A is played by Kurtwood Smith one of the more popular heavies these days so you know he s up to something What the film boils down to is an old fashioned mystery that is suspenseful and has its share of good twists along the way All of this is spiced with Woods growing surety that he is defending an innocent man and fighting a good fight his excitement in uncovering the mysteries surrounding the case are contagious The script is excellent and keeps things moving at all times Woods and Downey make a good team assisted by an upscale P I private investigator played by Margaret Colin who is getting typecast in this role who knew Woods in his radical days I will admit that there is a certain amount of Hollywood Courtroom Hokiness but it s not at objectionable levels And Woods one of the best character actors around keeps the high energy that has become his trademark under control unleashing it in the courtroom finale where it really sparks
0481,True Believer,1989,Capsule review James Woods is great at playing characters who are just a little slimy and self serving As a not very choosy civil liberties lawyer he finds for once he wants to believe his client is innocent James Woods usual realistic performance matched with a plot as complex as an Agatha Christie make TRUE BELIEVER one of Woods better films Rating low 2 James Woods is one of those actors like Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Farnsworth who have been around for a long time as character actors and who have built up a small following He will probably never see his name in big letters over Times Square but when he shows up in a coming attraction a lot of people myself included make a careful mental note of the film s title Woods with a pock marked face and a voice that is just this side of being actually gravelly generally plays slimeballs very effectively For me the films that come to mind when I think of Woods are VIDEODROME SALVADORE and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA It is not that he is in such good films TRUE BELIEVER is in third crime film in a row the other being BEST SELLER and COP neither bad but neither very good either By a wide margin TRUE BELIEVER is the best of the three and may well have the best script of any of his films Eddie Dodd played by Woods with a ponytail made a reputation for himself in the 1960s as a great civil liberties lawyer He tells himself he is in the same civil liberties fight today but his clients are almost exclusively drug dealers entrapped by the police and deep down it bothers him that while fighting for a constitutional principle he is also freeing a lot of guilty clients Then he is shaken from this routine by a new assistant played by Robert Downey Jr and a case defending a Korean who was convicted eight years earlier of a Chinatown gang killing and is now accused of a second killing in prison Dodd decides to see if he can overturn the original conviction In spite of Shu Kai Kim s lack of cooperation Woods wants desperately to believe Kim was innocent of the original killing So begins a complicated investigation involving neo Nazis drug dealers and possible police corruption TRUE BELIEVER has a puzzle of a plot with clues slipped to the viewer at unexpected moments But like an Agatha Christie everything makes sense by the end of the film The byplay between Dodd and his new assistant is often witty and often angry but unlike so many other crime films it never seems artificial or set up Director Joseph Ruben who previously directed DREAMSCAPE and THE STEPFATHER needs good actors and a good script Woods is a good actor but he also needs a good script Wesley Strick gave them a good script and they made a good solid crime mystery I rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0482,Rain Man,1988,After seeing RAIN MAN a few weeks ago I regret not having seen it last year as it would have certainly been on my top 10 list for 1988 Barry Levinson continues his run of making what I would term small pictures with big name actors with a pretty successful eye for casting Here he takes a road trip across America with two brothers played by Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman Cruise is Charlie a wheeler dealer who s slick self centered personality keeps everyone at bay When his father who Charlie has not seen since he left home as a teenager dies Charlie discovers that the majority of the estate has been left to a brother Raymond he never knew existed an autistic man who is something of an idiot savant who can juggle fantastic figures in his head but is panicked by the slightest deviation from the routine he is used to Hoping to get some of the estate to rescue his own flagging business Charlie kidnaps Ray to Los Angeles but must travel by road due to Ray s nervousness about flying This gives Levinson the chance to use the odd Americana vistas he knows so well as a backdrop to contrast two men who have severe inabilities to communicate one due to a rare physical disability and the other due to a far more common emotional one A friend of my family s has a son who is autistic and many of Ray s handicaps and abilities particularly the number crunching were familiar Charlie s particular handicap is also familiar and from a source much closer to home I suspect many will recognize it in those close to them and in themselves The story of how these two men bridge their particular handicaps is moving while rarely being cloying After years of sluggish bloated pictures by actors directors winning Oscars it s nice to finally see a director who deserves the title appear on the scene
0483,Torch Song Trilogy,1988,When considering a film that centers on the life of an individual character over a period of time the question is do you find the character interesting enough to continue watching the picture through it s length Despite a slow opener the answer is a definite yes for Harvey Fierstein s character in TORCH SONG TRILOGY The film adapts Fierstein s Broadway play which details the life of his character from the early 1970s to the early 1980s and his relationships with his family in particular his mother played by Anne Bancroft and his lovers played by Brian Kerwin and Matthew Broderick Fierstein by himself is witty and wry and has the theatrical habit of talking to the audience but once the supporting characters begin to share some screen time the drama picks up and the film becomes very involving The interaction of the characters particularly Fierstein Broderick and Fierstein Bancroft make the film and you end up caring for them and the particular crosses they have to bear I note that many reviewers describe TORCH SONG TRILOGY as a film about gay life which is inappropriate rather it s a character study of a man who is gay The film succeeds or fails on Fierstein s character it deals with personalities not issues and it works because the personalities on screen hold one s interest
0484,Mississippi Burning,1988,It was only a matter of time before the Civil Rights movement became a background for a Hollywood production Periods of history where great evils are most apparent have always been tableaus for drama and the ignorances and atrocities and courage which dotted the South during this period are fertile ground for this MISSISSIPPI BURNING not only uses Mississippi in the early 1960s as it s setting but it uses the events surrounding the murder of three civil rights activists as the basis of the story Unfortunately what director Alan Parker leaves behind are the facts of the case He shows the FBI as being the force behind bringing the murderers of the three young men spearheaded by a younger Justice Dept administrator Willem Dafoe and an older Southern raised agent Gene Hackman He tosses in a romantic interest for Hackman whose assault rankles him to try to find the murderers even if he has to break the law to do it And Parker basically sets the audience up to cheer on the FBI as they sink down to their opposition s level It s history throttled minced and served up in ROCKY IV style pandering to the Friday night crowds In truth the FBI dominated by J Edgar Hoover who felt that much of the civil rights movement were sponsored by Communists put nowhere near the force into the field to investigate the murders the killings did take on national attention as two of the activists were white The murderers were finally convicted by a bribe to one of their members not investigations done by the FBI Apparently history didn t give Parker the happy ending he was looking for so he decided to change it along with many of the events that surrounded the case to make a better movie Throughout this film I kept wondering why Parker hadn t made his film a fictionalized story set during this period but without alleged roots in the events of this case My only assumption is that to Alan Parker an Alan Parker film is more important than a misrepresentation of one of the more important events of the 1960s And this is an Alan Parker film Hollywood cliches are stuck in left and right particularly the old hand young reformer saw represented by Hackman and DaFoe Almost everyone is a stereotype which leads one to wonder whether the stupidity and bullying and violent ignorance displayed by the Klan and their ilk are due to bad breeding or bad writing If you ve seen TV footage of this period you ll know it s not bad writing but the level of the rest of the film brings that into doubt everything is so over played that the brutality of these people fades in comparison Even the carnage is stamped with Parker s particular visual amplification when the Klan bomb a Negro household with a can of gasoline not only does the house explode but the fence and the mailbox outside the house explode I think we get the picture Alan There are a few good points in the film Both Hackman and Dafoe valiantly attempt to make their characters break out of their two dimensional roles and Hackman succeeds at points due to sheer acting skill and stage presence But all in all it looks tailor made to reap Oscar awards as it already has Oscar nominations Hollywood likes nothing better than to applaud a film that pats itself on the back The South advanced away from prejudice mostly through the courage of black Southerners who risked their lives and their families well being to take a stand with little support from government agencies until the very end Watching DaFoe and Hackman ride off into the sunset with black and white children singing together is sugar coating what happened in the worst way it s almost as if Parker had never left advertising for feature films Like shouldn t they be holding cans of Diet Coke If you d like to see something that s twice as moving as this film and one hell of a lot more accurate I recommend renting EYES ON THE PRIZE a six hour video documentary of the Civil Rights movement which shown on PBS last year and is available at local libraries and some video stores I guarantee you that you won t be missing anything of interest that MISSISSIPPI BURNING has to offer by watching this instead Unless you really enjoy exploding mailboxes
0487,Lawrence of Arabia,1962,While it is an old film and a well known one I probably should say something about the restored version of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA since its release is one of the big events of the year What More words as Jack Hawkins asks early in the film And it s true there has has been a lot of media coverage As a labor of love Robert Harris has organized the restoration of a classic film many people s favorite film of all time and certainly one that deserves a 4 rating from me The time spent on the restoration was longer than was spent on the original film 19 months on the restoration 18 on the original film I think it is now film history what Harris and his people went through to restore the film First Harris got Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese to tell Columbia that if the restoration did not get funded there would be no more Columbia films by either director Harris s team scoured the world for prints that might have some footage that may have been cut from more commonly available editions They found footage for which they had no sound and in some cases no script They hired lip readers to tell them what the actors were saying Then they re hired Peter O Toole Alec Guinness and several of the other actors to recreate their voices for 1962 and to redub the scenes then they had to cut the new pieces in artificially add hiss so the transition would not be so noticeable and so forth It was a remarkable piece of work Further they had to remove the scratches for the pieces they had Surprisingly that is possible The scratches are only on the surface and there is a process by which if you put the film in fluid it fills up the cracks and you can transfer a scratchless image as long as you do so in the fluid So it was a giant piece of work though I am told not incredibly expensive as new films go and at the Ziegfeld in New York they did have lines wrapped around the block I stood for 90 minutes in the cold to get in and would probably do so again though I have to say I was less than pleased with the Ziegfeld s presentation of the restoration at least of the sound The music was painfully loud and I would say it sounded distorted It is rare that you see a 70mm print that is not a blown up 35mm print This was filmed on 70mm and you can see a difference not a tremendous difference but it is noticeable The mystical experience of seeing the desert in all the glory of the original film eluded me Yes it is very good photography and seeing it in this really wide screen version reminds you how good the photography is It is a very good cinematic experience seeing the restoration not much more Now here comes one of those pieces of heresy that I get my ears pinned back for occasionally The people who cut down the film from 223 minutes to 187 they diminished the film They did not butcher it That 187 minute film that I got off of cable that was a 4 film The restored version seen on the wide screen is a better film but not that much better Given that the film was going to be cut the butchers made pretty much the right cuts There is one notable exception the sequence of Lawrence massacring a group of Turks toward the end of the film The cut version was incoherent the full version was bloodier and made Lawrence less sympathetic probably the reason for the bad cut With the exception of that sequence and what it says about Lawrence I find that what I like the film for was never cut out of it Speaking of what it says about Lawrence I recommend an hour long program they run on PBS that tells you more about the real Lawrence than the film does I do not approve of the cuts that were made but the result was still a very good film
0488,Mighty Quinn The,1989,As they say in the song You ve not seen nothing like THE MIGHTY QUINN Resolving the double negative it means you have seen something like THE MIGHTY QUINN and indeed you have Ever since HAWAII FIVE O it has been common knowledge that television producers have wanted to set police films in pleasant climates We ve had CARIBE and MIAMI VICE actually make it to production Though nobody has said it anywhere my natural cynical suspicion is to believe that Jamaica is some producer s dream and THE MIGHTY QUINN is the pilot for a television series The film has the unmistakable or maybe only semi mistakable feel of a television pilot Our hero is a young idealistic Chief of Police Xavier Quinn played by Denzel Washington Born on a large Caribbean island Quinn went to the United States to get his training from the FBI He returned to the island to keep the peace driving an open jeep and wearing a conveniently photogenic uniform with short pants and short sleeves His boyish charms are irresistible to women regardless of social status Quinn has his problems dealing with the island governor an ex chicken inspector whose chief concern is to keep a lid on things for the resort business The governor is played by Norman Beaton who looks a bit like the late Adolph Caesar but without insulting Beaton lacks Caesar s magnetic screen presence In this case Maubee Quinn s boyhood friend is suspected of being involved in the murder of a resort owner who has been found with his head cut off Maubee is even more boyish and winning than is Quinn and he seems to be magical to boot Maubee is very disappointingly played by Robert Townsend of HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE Townsend has a bad habit of grinning at the camera that director Carl Schenkel should have curbed but did not This is one of those films when you are never more than ten minutes from a break in the action for the next song in this case reggae Lest you think that this is an actively bad film the basic story is okay as a mystery not great but not all that bad either though the villain is perhaps a bit predictable M Emmet Walsh and Esther Rolle are present and are always assets Though having just seen Rolle in PBS s superior production of A RAISIN IN THE SUN I find her performance here and this whole film tepid by comparison You want a recommendation See A RAISIN IN THE SUN Other assets of THE MIGHTY QUINN include some likable interaction between Quinn and his young son and the fact that the movie does not become a real action film at least not until the last few minutes and then only half heartedly There are at least a couple of in jokes one a reference to GUESS WHO S COMING TO DINNER and another a visual reference to DR NO I d rate THE MIGHTY QUINN an ambivalent low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0490,Yuki Yukite shingun,1987,Director Kazuo Hara Documentary Japan Japanese w English subtitles 1987 color 16mm 122 minutes Released by Kino International Corp 333 W 39th St New York NY 10018 phone 212 629 6880 Meet Kenzo Okuzaki a man on a mission from God Okuzaki served in the Japanese Army 32nd Engineering Corps garrisoned at Wewak New Guinea during World War II Okuzaki is obsessed with the war and holds Emperor Hirohito responsible for the suffering it caused Okuzaki became famous in Japan in 1969 when he used a slingshot to fire four pachinko balls lead pellets at the Emperor then passed out pamphlets which depicted Emperor Hirohito engaging in pornographic sex acts at a downtown Tokyo Department store For these crimes he served time in prison In this film we get to follow Kenzo Okuzaki as he investigates the mysterious deaths of fellow soldiers in the 32nd Corps after the end of the war Rather than surrender the 32nd Corps scattered into the jungles of New Guinea Out of more than 1000 soldiers only about thirty survived The investigative style used by Okuzaki is unique With camera crew in tow he arrives unannounced at the homes of his former 32nd Corps alumni and interrogates them If they don t cooperate he doesn t hesitate to beat the information out of them Okuzaki is not afraid to suffer the consequences of his actions and he even offers to call the police after beating up the person he interrogated The net result of his investigation is the revelation of some very disturbing facts After the end of the war a Japanese soldier was murdered for food i e he was cannibalized by his fellow soldiers Two other soldiers were officially executed so that their commanding officers could cannibalize them There is a chilling conversation with an alumnus of the 32nd Corps who calmly discusses the prevalence and practice of cannibalism at the end of the war He refers to black pork cannibalizing the New Guinea natives and white pork cannibalizing other Japanese soldiers or white prisoners of war and reports that the consumption of these kinds of pork was commonplace This is a unique and extraordinary film It invokes a wide range of emotions At times it is funny at times very chilling Okuzaki comes across as a man obsessed a man driven by a mission from God to save Japan from future wars by exposing the horror of the last war In effect Okuzaki is a militant anti war crusader Okuzaki is also a study in contradictions He denounces families as an artificial creation a violation of divine law Yet he is of course married He is opposed to war because of its nature as violence yet will not hesitate to use violence to achieve his divine goals Finally he is in his own words against the establishment yet he tolerates the police and their intrusions they follow him around all the time This film is very well made The 16mm film and ambient lighting give it a gritty feel that enhances the action Although a bit slow in the beginning the pace picks up quickly and the film holds your attention and interest This is a very thought provoking film Okuzaki is a Japanese fanatic but we have plenty of people like him here oops the polite word is political activist In this film you can readily see that Okuzaki is interested only in the end result of his crusade the means used to achieve said end being irrelevant However unlike most political activists here Okuzaki is willing in fact proud to accept the consequences of his actions Overall evaluation very good definitely worth seeing and discussing with friends afterward
0491,Beirut: The Last Home Movie,1987,Director Jennifer Fox Documentary USA 1987 color 123 minutes Released by Circle Releasing Corp This documentary tells the story of a woman Gaby Bustros who returned to her home in Beirut in 1981 after spending 15 years in the US and who decides to stay in Beirut despite the ongoing civil war The Bustros family consists of Gaby and her two older sisters all in their thirties her younger brother in his twenties and her mother The family lives in a very large and luxurious mansion located in the Ashrafiya neighborhood of Beirut scene of some of the most vicious fighting of the Lebanese civil war The first half of the film centers on how the family manages to live nearly normal lives despite the violent war raging around them The family essentially ignores the fact that artillery shells have landed in their garden blowing up trees and killing a soldier from the local militia When the shelling gets really fierce they close all the window shutters and throw small neighborhood parties while the rockets and artillery explode around them Many of the interviews in the film have as background noise the gunfire of the war which seems to never end The considerable wealth of the Bustros family is a sharp contrast to the chaos and destruction that surrounds them A point of considerable discussion in the film is the fact that the family could sell their home at a substantial profit and move to a safer area Paris New York etc However Gaby s oldest sister refuses to consider the idea and insists on staying The film suggests that her reluctance to move may be because she finds the war to be exciting A more pedestrian also more plausible explanation is that she has an emotional attachment to the house Unfortunately the film does not explore this possibility In the middle of the film there is an interesting conversation with two male friends of the family which takes place on a sailboat in Beirut harbor One friend blames the war on the laziness of the Lebanese their unwillingness to protect their freedom The other friend claims that war has become a way of life for the Lebanese Although the first half of the movie provides an interesting look at life in a war zone from a woman s perspective the last half of the film is a real disappointment The film moves into a study of the failed love lives of the sisters their feelings for their late father and the upcoming wedding of Gaby s brother In other words the film degenerates into something resembling a very boring soap opera The only high point of the second half is the spectacular and yes beautiful footage of nighttime artillery rocket battles in Beirut and the warm glow of the city as it burns afterward I went to see this film because I have some first hand knowledge of Beirut having visited the city three times My last visit was unscheduled I was flying standby from New Delhi to Rome and was offloaded in Beirut at a time when there was active fighting I had the privilege of experiencing the civil war first hand Moral of story if you fly standby don t fly through Beirut Also the local film critics praised the film highly I was deeply disappointed by the film and regard it as a rather boring soap opera style documentary Overall evaluation poor recommend you avoid it P S The Boston PBS station WGBH provided some of the funding for this film This suggests that the film may soon appear on PBS television stations If you are a supporter of your local PBS station you might consider sending their programming department a note suggesting that they not waste any of their limited programming budget on this boring film
0492,Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure,1989,Misadventures in Time Space BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is a low budget derivative silly film that shamelessly panders to its teen age target audience it represents nothing new in film making and is blatantly commercial The plot is simple enough Bill and Ted are two California kids who want to become famous rock stars There s only one problem they can t play their instruments Well actually there s two problems they re both complete boneheads and their hardnosed history teacher tells them that if they don t pass their oral history report they will flunk out of school This oral report involves imagining what historical personages would ve thought of the present day and the local environment Not too demanding but it s still above the ability of these two and if they flunk Ted s sourpuss dad intends to send him off to a military academy in Alaska and the two friends will be separated probably forever Fortunately the society of Earth 700 years from now has a special interest in them and an agent George Carlin is sent back in a time machine shaped like a phone booth a normal one not a British police box to help out So Bill and Ted have in their hands the best possible tool for conducting historical research This sounds silly and it is and all the unkind things I said above about this movie are true which leads to the question What saves it Simple enough Bill and Ted These two guys don t look like they have the collective mental energy to make a nightlight glow they don t actually have to do anything to be funny You laugh at them even if they re just standing there Though when push comes to shove it turns out they re not inherently dumb by any means like a lot of teenagers they just need to get motivated It s hard not to like them they re about as good natured kids as you re likely to find Bill has the initiative he takes risks without hesitation because he doesn t realize what he s getting into Ted is a born romantic a sweet faced kid who all the girls think is really cute any time he sees a good looking girl his heart leaps into his throat and stars flicker in his eyes The story like I said is silly but silliness is hardly a critical term when applied to a comedy and it does have its moments Napoleon at the water slides Genghis Kahn well I won t say any more It certainly does pander to teenagers nearly all the adults are creeps or morons and the kids turn the tables on them in the end but it also made me feel wistful I didn t enjoy being a teenager this film reminds me in its own bizarre way that it could ve been more fun than it was The only thing I can seriously say against this film was that by the time it was over I was glad I didn t have to listen to PARTY ON DUDE and EXCELLENT one more time BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE will not win any awards in fact nobody in their right mind would recommend it for one Some movies are like expensive dinners others are like Big Macs But as Big Macs go BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is pretty tasty and I hope they make a fortune on it Oh yeah the usual cautions No noticeable bad language overt sexual activity or graphic violence unless you are the sort of person who feels that the Three Stooges are a bad influence on kids Not for people who only go to serious films author shakes his head sadly then shrugs they should go to something with subtitles
0493,Rain Man,1988,Over his illustrious career Dustin Hoffman has turned in stellar performances Ratso Rizzo in MIDNIGHT COWBOY Lenny Bruce in LENNY a single parent in KRAMER VS KRAMER an actor turned actress in TOOTSIE a senile man in DEATH OF A SALESMAN and what may be his finest role Raymond Babbit in RAIN MAN Dustin Hoffman portrays Raymond Babbit an autistic savant and Tom Cruise stars as Raymond s brother Charlie Babbit Charlie makes his living by dealing very high priced cars Porsche Lamborghini etc Charlie soon learns about his father s death and at the reading of the will he learns that his father has given the bulk of the estate to a brother that he never new existed After Charlie learns about the whereabouts of his brother and after he learns that his brother is autistic Charlie plans to kidnap Raymond in order to get half of his inheritance which he feels is due him Raymond and Charlie embark on a cross country trip It is while they are traveling through the country that Charlie learns about Raymond s extraordinary skills This is an excellent movie which has perhaps one flaw I think it is the fact that director Barry Levinson did not focus more on what being an autistic sevant is really like The director shows us a little bit about autistic people but he did not go into more depth on the subject Look for Dustin Hoffman s name come Oscar time He is one of this generation s finest actors Barry Levinson has directed some great films in the past THE NATURAL DINER TIN MEN and GOOD MORNING VIETNAM With RAIN MAN he has continued in that tradition of great filmmaking
0494,Adventures of Baron Munchausen The,1988,Director Terry Gilliam Producer Thomas Schuhly Screenplay Terry Gilliam Charles McKeown Principal cast John Neville Sarah Polley Eric Idle Jonathan Pryce Valentina Cortese Uma Thurman Oliver Reed Bill Paterson Alison Steadman Production Company Prominent Features Laura Film Released by Columbia Pictures This highly publicized movie set for national release beginning Friday March 10 largely lives up to the publicity preceding its release The story deals with Baron Munchausen one of the most famous liars storytellers in history and his fantastic exploits The story begins in an unspecified European city in the late 18th century The city is under siege by the Turks and is in grave danger of falling A traveling theater company is performing the story of the adventures of Baron Munchausen in the city when their performance is interrupted by an old man claiming to be the real Baron Munchausen The real Baron proceeds to tell his stories and they are fantastic indeed As the film progresses the Baron has one adventure after another He wins a treasure in a bet with a Sultan using the super powers of his companions he goes for a ride on two cannonballs he goes to the moon on a hot air balloon made exclusively from women s lingerie he falls into a volcano meets Vulcan the god of war romances his wife Venus the god of love etc These adventures take place at a very fast pace The film is laced with the great sense of humor warped that characterized the other films of Director Terry Gilliam TIME BANDITS BRAZIL Some examples when the Baron first encounters Vulcan the god of war played by Oliver Reed in an excellent performance he is having labor troubles with his workers and is negotiating a work contract with them Vulcan as portrayed by Reed comes across sounding and acting like a harassed British shop supervisor the humor is subtle but very good Robin Williams appears as the King of the Moon in a manic performance that is surprise very funny Robin Williams is one comedian I generally can t stand For me to actually like his performance is most unusual Oh yes the King and Queen of the Moon have detachable heads which fly around independent of their bodies which are off doing bodily functions On a deeper level the film deals with the issues of fantasy vs reality truth and fiction life and death youth and old age Throughout the film the Baron is pursued by a ghoul like figure that represents death These issues are dealt with in a layered fashion and are illustrated to varying degrees in the fantastic exploits of the Baron From a non intellectual viewpoint the film is simply loads of fun You don t need to intellectualize just sit back and enjoy the Baron s utterly fantastic adventures Stylistically and thematically the film is closer to TIME BANDITS than it is to BRAZIL It is fairly safe to say that most fans of either film TIME BANDITS BRAZIL will like THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN Overall evaluation excellent worth seeing
0495,Adventures of Baron Munchausen The,1988,THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN caps Terry Gilliam s trilogy begun with TIME BANDITS the escape of the boy and BRAZIL the escape of the man The Baron represents among other things the escape of the old man This film is so packed with images and ideas that I hardly know where to begin The story is set in the late 17th Century the dawn of the Age of Reason A city is under attack by the Turks and a small troupe of actors is performing The Adventures of Baron Munchausen who is the protagonist of European legends and folk tales An old man enters the shelled out theatre and proclaims himself the real Baron Munchausen No one believes him except for a young girl The Baron starts to tell his story and the line between fact and fiction stretches to the breaking point He and the girl embark on a bizarre quest to re unite the amazing Baron with his equally amazing servants the strongest man in the world the fastest man in the world a dwarf with amazing hearing and the ability to create gale force winds from his lungs and a marksman capable of seeing and hitting a bulls eye from half way around the world The sheer scale and audacity of MUNCHAUSEN is tremendous Gilliam has the amazing ability to make metaphors legends and gods literally walk and talk Any one of a dozen sequences from this film could have been the climax of any ordinary movie and still been enough to make it a good one Gilliam has combined a child s sensibility thousands of years of myth and his own formidable genius and vision into a truly fantastic film His ability to pack the frame with new ideas and minute details to build a consistent and wonderful world was very evident in BRAZIL but now with MUNCHAUSEN he has eclipsed himself The imagination at work here makes THE WIZARD OF OZ seem cautious and PINNOCHIO appear plausible There are many levels to this film but I think that THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN is primarily the story of romance versus reason of imagination versus science and of fantasy versus fact And romance imagination and fantasy win triumphantly If this isn t the best movie of 1989 it will have been a very very good year indeed
0496,Adventures of Baron Munchausen The,1988,Capsule review Once again the ever so slightly exaggerated adventures of the great Baron are told Terry Gilliam brings many of the great images of the Munchausen stories to the screen but the story that ties them together has problems Rating high 1 THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN is purported to be the final installment of a trilogy of films directed by Terry Gilliam the animator for the Monty Python television series And while the first two TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL were based on original screenplays BARON MUNCHAUSEN is an adaptation of the famous adventures which are for Europe sort of what the Oz stories are for the United States The earliest Munchausen stories were first published in 1785 Since then the tall tales have taken many forms Many Americans first became aware of the Baron through NBC s 1933 radio program THE JACK PEARL SHOW in which Pearl played the Baron There have been at least two previous film versions one from Germany in 1943 with Hans Albers as the Baron and one from Czechoslovakia in 1961 with Milos Kopecky The latter used to show up on New York television and did some very imaginative combining of live actors and animation Terry Gilliam s version is the latest version and like the 1961 and probably the 1943 versions visually it owes very much to one of the great book illustrators of all time Gustave Dore The story of Gilliam s film is not taken from the book but rather is a tying together of the more imaginative scenes that Dore illustrated but in what is at times a more rapid fire pace And only at times because the pacing of BARON MUNCHAUSEN is extremely uneven As in TIME BANDITS Gilliam has little idea of which of his sequences are really entertaining and which are simply dull More than once the viewer feels like telling Gilliam that he has made his point is wasting precious screen time on an idea that has no more to offer and should get on with things Then as often as not the next scene is a gem The story has a small theatre company putting on their production of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in a city besieged by the Ottoman Turks As the pallid play proceeds who should arrive but the Baron himself to give his own account of his adventures The story is difficult to relate from there not just because it is hard to tell what is fantasy and what is reality but because the script actually contradicts itself as to what is its actual story line versus story within story Hence the story line does not bear close examination Somewhere in all this is the Baron s bet with a sultan and a trip to the moon with Robin Williams playing a very strange moon man There is a visit to Vulcan s forge and another to the belly of a huge fish Finally there is a stupendous battle between the Ottoman Turks and the Baron s friends who amount to virtual super heroes Like the 1961 version this film is a treat more for the eye than for the mind Scenes of the city under siege are done with tremendous historical realism Some scenes of fantasy are done with great imagination Then just when the proper mood is established Gilliam will throw in an anachronistic reference and get a chuckle from the audience at the expense of the mood THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN is a film that when it is good is very very good and when it is bad it can be quite bad It is a tough film to rate overall but probably deserves a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale better than TIME BANDITS not as good as BRAZIL
0498,Earth Girls Are Easy,1989,Screened at its U S premiere March 10 1989 at the San Francisco International Film Festival Kabuki Theatre San Francisco Synopsis Space aliens visit earth and while they re here decide to have a good time with human girlfriends An outrageously funny and delightful comedy satire Director Julien Temple Producer Tony Garnet Screenplay Julie Brown Charlie Coffey Terrence E McNally Principal cast Geena Davis Jeff Goldblum Julie Brown Charles Rocket Jim Carrey Damon Wayans Released by Vestron Pictures Director Julien Temple scores a bullseye with this light warm hearted film that manages to satirize just about everything including consumerism Los Angeles style pop culture modern romance and science fiction films The satire is very well done without the hard edges or cynicism that is so common nowadays The film begins by showing us the inside of an alien space ship which is piloted by three furry humanoid creatures They are frustrated and lonely as they are on a long journey without female companions The only female companionship available to them is to play holographic projections of alien females The film then shifts to earth where we meet Valerie Geena Davis an air headed manicurist who works at the Curl Up Dye hair salon It seems that Valerie is engaged to a young Doctor who is chasing every skirt in town but hers and she is disturbed by this Anyway the alien space ship is passing earth and they decide to do a little girl watching They happen to zoom in on Valerie s home and they see her sunbathing by the pool When Valerie removes her breast protective device the top of her bikini one of the aliens gets so excited that it leads to the alien ship crash landing in her pool This sets in motion a sequence of truly unique and hilarious events as the aliens suffer real culture shock in LA Valerie takes the aliens to the beauty salon for a make over so that they are presentable in society They then go out for a night on the town There is a truly hilarious scene in a bar where one of the aliens is drinking out of a tall glass He sticks his long several inches tongue into the glass whereupon the four beautiful girls he is with start openly fighting among themselves to see which girl gets to go home with him that night I won t give away any more of the film to avoid spoiling anything Rest assured that there is a lot more humor in the film This film is a real delight It is outrageously funny but also warm hearted It is very fast paced and includes send ups of among other things science fiction films beach blanket films television and Jerry Lewis Audience reaction at the premiere was enthusiastic to say the least Oh yes it is also a romance film and those aspects of the film also receive the comic touch There are a few other points that should be mentioned Director Julien Temple is best known for music videos although he has directed other films ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS THE GREAT ROCK AND ROLL SWINDLE and this film does include a few sequences that are essentially music videos Although the music is nothing special these videos are funny and fit well into the movie Also the special effects of the alien spaceship except for the holographic alien females are really cheesy The alien costumes are also rather obvious However this does not detract from the film the appeal of this film is its satire and comedy not special effects Note the holographic alien females effect is nicely done I really enjoyed this film and I think most people will too The only danger in viewing it is that you will be overwhelmed by the humor which comes at a frantic pace I am also quite certain that this film will be a very big hit when it is released this summer In summary I would describe this film as the funniest full length film I have seen in a very long time Remark it is funnier than THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN though the films are not directly comparable MUNCHAUSEN is primarily an adventure film which coincidentally has plenty of humor in it EARTH GIRLS is pure comedy Overall evaluation highest rating possible a must see

0501,New York Stories,1989,The multi episode film while it goes back at least as far as D W Griffith s INTOLERANCE had its real blossoming in the 1940s and 1950s with films such as DEAD OF NIGHT O HENRY S FULL HOUSE FLESH AND FANTASY QUARTET and TRIO In the 1960s it was mostly reserved for the horror film with entries such as BLACK SABBATH SPIRITS OF THE DEAD the non horror BOCCACCIO 70 and a whole series of horror anthology films from Amicus Films of Britain Arguably even last year s ARIA might be included but in general multi episode films have almost disappeared Now Disney s Touchstone has given three popular directors a chance to work with a shorter than feature length piece Life Lessons by Martin Scorsese has Nick Nolte as a popular artist who is behind schedule painting for a show of his works coming up in three weeks His girlfriend just returning from a fling with another man comes back to live in Nolte s studio and re begin a stormy relationship with Nolte The artist channels his rage into a painting fury The story has a not too surprising semi twist ending There is a lot of shouting a lot of loud 1960s music and one nice piece of music from Puccini s TURNADOT There is sound and fury signifying something but perhaps not enough I would rate this segment a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale Francis Ford Coppola s Life Without Zoe is essentially a children s film a genre Coppola does surprisingly well in His Zoetrope company made the very good THE BLACK STALLION Coppola falls just a little flat here Life Without Zoe is about a poor little fantastically rich kid who lives under the guardianship of a kindly and funny butler in a posh New York hotel By sheer force of good Zoe is able to solve a big problem for her father and to bring about the reconciliation of her parents You don t have to be poor to be happy Aren t you pleased I give this one a 1 The final segment Oedipus Wrecks is a Woody Allen fantasy about a little Jewish nebbish whose life is made miserable by his embarrassing and manipulative mother Deep down he wishes for her just to disappear Some supernatural force grants his wish only to make things a lot worse for him While never hilarious this film has more jokes per minute than any film Allen has made since LOVE AND DEATH I rate it a 1
0502,Canibais Os,1988,Screened at its U S premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival March 14 1989 Synopsis Opera stars turn cannibal in this film a parody of grand opera with a savage and frequently sick sense of humor Very strange Portugal France Portuguese with English subtitles 1988 color 100 minutes Director Screenplay Manoel de Oliveira based on a work by Alvaro Carvalhal Producer Paolo Branco Principal Cast Leonor Siveira Luis Miguel Cintra Diogo Doria Print Source Portuguese Film Institute This film is an opera about the romance and eventual marriage of a beautiful lady to a rather morose Viscount while an intensely jealous rival suitor his name is Don Juan looks on from the sidelines On the wedding night a series of bizarre and grotesque events occur after which there is a controversy over a well charred roast could it be human The first hour of the film is rather tedious as the Director spoofs all the conventions of grand opera and costume dramas The film s narrator serves as a built in critic at times providing literary criticism of the story as well However the viewer s patience is rewarded as the sick and savagely funny events occur in the last half hour A few points should be noted Although the first half is tedious at times there is some rather corny humor in it to make it endurable Devoted opera fans may be offended by this film and the many delightful ways it pokes fun at and insults opera conventions Also note that some of the humor in the second half is pretty sick There were times when half the audience was laughing while the other half was gasping in horror Technical merits The photography is excellent the period costumes and sets 1700 s grand opera are superb and there is careful attention to detail The acting is relatively good considering that it is opera style i e exaggerated facial gestures The production values are very high this is not a cheap film My overall evaluation of this film good to very good Is it worth seeing This depends on how you feel about opera and your sense of humor Can you stand to sit through about 1 hour of opera low volume very little of the wailing shrieking and bellowing that opera fans call art for a half hour of savagely funny humor Of course if you like opera you might like the film s spoofing of opera i e in which case you might like the first hour I thought it was pretty funny but I hate opera so much that I resented having to wait so long to get to the good parts However this is a film worthy of serious consideration
0503,Topio stin omichli,1988,Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival March 12 1989 Synopsis Two young Greek children set off on an odyssey to find their Father Their voyage takes them through a world dominated by adults a strange surreal and savage world A depressing disturbing film Greece Greek with English subtitles 1988 color 127 minutes Director Producer Theo Angelopoulos Screenplay Theo Angelopoulos Tonino Guerra Thanassis Valtinos Principal Cast Michalis Zeke Tania Palaiologou Stratos Tzortzoglou The time is the present the place Greece Two young children Alexander 6 years old and his sister Voula 11 years old go to the Athens train station every night to await the return of their Father a man they have never met or even seen pictures of Their Father never arrives and the children desperate to find him jump on a train to go to far off Germany where they believe their Father is to be found Thus begins the children s odyssey in the world of adults as seen through their eyes It isn t long before they are discovered by the train Conductor and turned over to the Police They tell the Police that they are on their way to visit their Uncle When delivered to their Uncle he repudiates them telling the Police that he doesn t want to get involved for the children are illegitimate This is overheard by the girl and she is very angry The children are then taken to the Police station At this point it starts to snow which causes all the Police to go outside and stand like statues literally watching it snow This allows the children to make a convenient escape and continue their travels The children stubbornly continue their journey to Germany and are alternately befriended exploited and brutalized by adults along the way A member of a traveling theatre company helps them in their trip to the border The adult world as seen through the children s eyes is a strange place indeed For some reason these adults are in the habit of standing as still as statues whenever the Director thinks it is convenient Although this tends to give the picture a surreal feel it is also quite ridiculous The picture of the adult world that this picture paints is bleak and despairing cruel and savage Be warned that there are some shocking scenes in this picture In particular there is a scene where a live horse is dragged on its side down the road by a tractor The rope breaks and the horse dies apparently in great pain in front of the children As the horse dies a wedding party emerges from a building in the background they are celebrating a joyous wedding The Director may have been trying to produce a great contrast here all he succeeded in doing was disgusting me This film makes a very large emotional impact on the viewer Unfortunately the emotions it raises are despair depression shock and anger It has been a long time since I have seen such a depressing film In a certain sense it is reasonable to describe this as a real life horror film If you go to the movies to wallow in depression then this is the movie for you If you go to enjoy yourself than avoid the pain by avoiding this film

0505,Chances Are,1989,The light supernatural comedy fantasy has been around for a long time having its greatest flourish in the late 1930s and early 1940s with the film versions of Thorne Smith s books particularly the Topper series and TURNABOUT I doubt that there has been a year since the 1940s that has not had one and probably several from ONE TOUCH OF VENUS to BIG But lately perhaps in part due to the so called New Age thinking there has been an upswing in the number of whimsical comedies on supernatural themes such as soul transference and reincarnation The turnabout films in which the protagonists trade bodies have almost become their own sub genre The latest entry in the supernatural derby last time I checked is CHANCES ARE The prologue introduces us to newlyweds Louie and Corinne Jeffries played by Christopher McDonald and Cybill Shepherd They are passionately in love Louie s best friend Philip Train played by Ryan O Neal also loves Corinne but from a proper distance Louie loves Corinne so much he cannot worry about minor things like crossing streets safely which is how he comes to be in Heaven asking to be reincarnated as close as possible to Corinne Flash forward twenty four years and Louie is now in his next life as Yale journalism graduate Alex Finch played by Robert Downey Jr Through an odd not to say absurd set of coincidences Alex finds himself in the house he used to own looking at the woman who used to be his wife and it all comes back to him CHANCES ARE is unpretentious and whimsical When he first realizes the joke that fate has played on him Alex completely loses all his self control in a way that seems totally out of character Previously having shown himself to be a quick thinker it is unlikely that he would so totally go incoherent without ever asking himself How must this behavior look to other people One curious novelty of this film is that Cybill Shepherd comes off as doing a reasonable acting job I think this works by contrast to Robert Downey Jr who is not yet an accomplished actor by anybody s definition Then there s Ryan O Neal who can display the whole range of emotions from A to A 5 Like Downey O Neal started his career playing good looking youths but already Downey has more dramatic range than O Neal CHANCES ARE is a pleasant but unoriginal television quality film I rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0506,Tabataba,1988,Screened at its U S premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival March 16 1989 Synopsis A dramatization of the 1947 rebellion against French rule in Madagascar as experienced in a small village Though slow moving at times this is a very interesting film Madagascar France Malagasy with English subtitles 1988 color 84 minutes Director Raymond Rajaonarivelo Producer Jacques Le Glou Screenplay Raymond Rajaonarivelo Robert Archer Print Source Les Films du Volcan If I told you that this film was shot in a remote village in the southern part of Madagascar that the cast was largely composed of local residents with no acting experience and that it is the first feature film by its director you would probably expect it to be boring and or amateurish All the points mentioned above are true however the film is relatively well made and is quite interesting Speaking of preconceived ideas I was concerned before seeing the film that it would be full of leftist propaganda and cliches Fortunately that is not the case either What the film does do is dramatize the events of the March 1947 Malagasy rebellion as experienced in the lives of the members of a remote village in the southern region of Madagascar The basic story is as follows A stranger from an outlawed political party visits the village to encourage the residents to fight for independence against the French The villagers fall into two factions those wanting to fight and those who seek independence by non violent means Later a French official visits the village so the residents can vote for their representatives in Paris The people refuse to vote and the schoolteacher who refused to encourage the villagers to vote is arrested as a subversive The arrest of the teacher galvanizes the villagers and the men of the village go out armed only with spears carved in the shape of guns to rescue the teacher and join the resistance against the French The remainder of the story concerns the attempt to rescue the teacher and retaliation by the French who used an army of Senegalese mercenaries the Vazaha against the villagers The film seems a bit downbeat as one of the main points it makes is that the 1947 rebellion was futile An army of men equipped only with spears is useless against an army of trained mercenaries equipped with automatic weapons In the 1947 rebellion over 100 000 people died Madagascar eventually gained independence in 1960 However even in defeat the Malagasy people maintain their dignity and self respect Another important thing the film does is put a human face on the struggle for independence The people fighting for independence are commoners everyday citizens The only way to win independence is through sacrifice and struggle There is one aspect of the film that will puzzle Americans At several points in the film there are references to the fact that the Malagasy people believed that America would intervene on their behalf and send weapons This was due to two things First the Malagasy heard that America had saved France in 1945 liberation of France in World War II and they thought that America was going to save the entire world including Madagascar Additionally an American sea captain had given in early 1947 a pistol as a gift to a native on the west coast of Madagascar and this caused many rumors that America was going to help the Malagasy The information above concerning the belief of the Malagasy people that America would help them is not explained in the film As this was the U S premiere the film s director was in attendance and chaired a discussion afterwards where this information was brought out The only possible drawback to the film is its pacing which may seem slow to some Although slow at times it held my interest Even some of the slow parts are interesting as they illustrate life in rural Madagascar Overall evaluation very good consider seeing it P S Presentation of this film at the San Francisco International Film Festival was sponsored by the Bravo Cable Network This suggests that the film may eventually appear on the Bravo cable channel If it does be sure to watch it the film is definitely worth seeing
0507,Leviathan,1989,LEVIATHAN no stars out of four Director George P Cosmatos Cast Peter Weller Amanda Pays Richard Crenna Hector Elizondo Daniel Stern Lisa Eilbacher Ernie Hudson Meg Foster Okay no one expects a movie like LEVIATHAN to be great Or even necessarily very good But even in this era of lowered expectations LEVIATHAN proves that one s expectations can never be too low This is not an underwater ripoff of ALIEN it is a virtual remake But Mr Cosmatos you re no Ridley Scott All of the elements of Scott s film are assembled As the following diagram illustrates Shack Number 7 s crew matches very nicely with the crew of the Nostromo Tom Skerritt Peter Weller Sigourney Weaver Amanda Pays Ian Holm Richard Crenna Yaphet Kotto Ernie Hudson Veronica Cartwright Lisa Eilbacher Harry Dean Stanton Hector Elizondo Obviously LEVIATHAN isn t original Okay That was kind of obvious from the outset But what is unforgivable is LEVIATHAN S utter ineptitude Every opportunity for suspense or tension is frittered away Everything is flat and uninspired Cosmatos simply doesn t know how to build a scene He seems more interested in getting Ms Pays into her underwear not once but twice than moving the story along By the end it has become so completely ridiculous that there is nothing left to do but laugh Except I wasn t laughing This is the kind of moviemaking that is really depressing aiming low and missing
0509,Wan Zhong,1986,Screened at its U S premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival March 18 1989 Synopsis In China shortly after Japan surrendered at the end of World War II a small group of Chinese soldiers encounter a large group of starving Japanese soldiers hiding in a remote cave The Japanese don t know that the war is over and a standoff ensues Very intense war drama China Mandarin with English subtitles 1987 released 1989 color 90 minutes This rather intense film was produced in 1987 but it was not released until this year as it was initially banned by the Chinese government for its sympathetic treatment of China s enemies The film was extensively edited to produce the current released version The director s third film DOVE TREE which deals with the China Vietnam war is still banned for its sympathetic treatment of the Vietnamese What is meant by sympathetic treatment is that this film portrays Japanese soldiers as human beings not monsters However the horror of war is amply illustrated in this film which includes a lot of extreme violence The film opens with the mass suicide of a large group of Japanese soldiers they are committing suicide because Japan was defeated in the war This sets the tone for this very tense film The film moves on to show a group of five weary Chinese soldiers searching a devastated bombed rural area They move from one horror to the next piles of dead Japanese soldiers then stop to disarm a bomb found by a farmer and so on They encounter an injured Japanese soldier while searching some ruins After they give him food and water he leads them to a remote cave in the mountains where there are 32 starving Japanese soldiers However there are some complications The cave is a well defended armory and they have unlimited weapons they have guns but no food Also they were cut off from outside contact and do not know that the war is over There follows a tense standoff as the Chinese soldiers try to convince the Japanese to surrender The film depicts both sides as human beings no propaganda or cliches here It makes the point that despite the insanity of war the warring parties can rise above the horror and treat each other as people rather than shooting targets The photography is excellent here and includes much of the beautiful landscape photography that characterized another recent film from China FAR FROM WAR The acting is very good you can see them struggle with the tension of the situation they are in Overall evaluation very good Note however the film is very intense and includes considerable violence
0510,Kalaa El,1988,Screened at its U S premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival March 19 1989 Synopsis In a small village in rural Algeria the village idiot is madly in love with a married woman His voyeurism and antics bring shame on his father who guarantees that his son will be married that same day or his four wives will be repudiated An interesting and very witty story with great sarcastic humor Algeria Arabic with English subtitles 1988 color 95 minutes Director Screenplay Mohamed Chouikh Producer Mohamed Tahar Harhoura Print Source K Z Films New York Enter the world of El Kalaa a small village in rural Algeria where the men and women live in separate and unequal worlds Here polygamy and wife beating are common and women are owned by men The events of the film take place in a single day in El Kalaa and center around Kaddour the adopted son of a town merchant Kaddour is very simple minded i e he s the village idiot but not a Monty Python style village idiot Kaddour is madly in love with one of the wives of the town cobbler He starts his day by waiting outside her home to catch a glimpse of her however he is discovered and chased away The woman s husband reports the event to Kaddour s father who is very angry Later Kaddour visits a soothsayer who turns out to be very funny for help in winning the woman he wants by magic Kaddour must perform certain tasks and acquire certain things including getting a lock of the woman s hair After he takes a lock of her hair by force an angry mob of men led by the woman s husband goes to Kaddour s home demanding he be punished Kaddour s father is able to calm the situation but only by promising that his son will be married off that day or else he will repudiate divorce his four wives The remainder of the story deals with Kaddour s marriage and the unique way in which his father fulfills his promise that his son will be married that same day Although the film takes place within a cultural framework most of us are not familiar with it deals with a universal topic the relationship between men and women The story is told in an interesting manner and with very witty dialogue and sarcastic humor For example in an argument between some women about their place in society one woman dryly observes that A woman s paradise is under a man s foot Note that men are not treated very kindly in this film They are depicted as voyeurs polygamists wife beaters thieves and just plain silly Women are depicted as slaves as property of the men Male chauvinists probably won t like this film The interesting thing is the treatment of Kaddour the main character Initially he is rather odious a voyeur and other bad things As the film progresses you start feeling sorry for him until you eventually sympathize with him as he is in a certain sense a victim of the static society he lives in This film provides an interesting look into a static patriarchal society However it does so with class and humor and a very interesting story as well Overall evaluation very good to excellent worth seeing
0511,Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey The,1988,This Australian and New Zealand movie left me feeling hot and cold because the director Vincent Ward has illustrated all my pet theories about Man being his own religion in the most brilliant story that I have seen for a long time It starts off in a mediaeval Cumbrian copper mining village in the snow of March 1348 when two thirds of Europe was busy being wiped out by the Bubonic Plague THE NAVIGATOR works on several levels as an adventure story but mainly as a spiritual fulfillment for the protagonists and not least for the audience It illustrated to me at least that it s not the religion itself that counts but rather the power that humans have with their positive belief be it in themselves God Christ Allah that constitutes Spiritual Reality In this movie the Spirituality of the people of an age passed controlling their own destiny is contrasted with our own spiritual less and consequently doomed age Yes it is heavy stuff All else I can say without spoiling the movie for those of you who are in to this sort of thing and lucky enough to be able to see it is be prepared to suspend your disbelief fairly early on in the picture so that it won t get in the way of the philosophy just trust that all will be revealed Several spoiler paragraphs removed here The plot is extremely well connected although some 20th Century sequences were a tad Indiana Jonesish and drawn out for my taste This may bother some people who may have found it unbelievable that the 20th Century made it into the movie at all to the point that they might miss the underlying philosophies Not all the acting is brilliant However at the very least there is some pretty black humour in the juxtaposition of the 20th and 14th Centuries witness the tragic parting of one member of the party because he cannot make it across the busy freeway A brilliant movie 6 AFI Awards Best Picture Director etc
0513,Zan Boko,1988,The 32nd San Francisco International Film Festival took place from March 7 19 1989 Approximately 80 90 films were screened about half of which were U S premieres Most of the films shown were from countries other than the U S Films were shown at three different locations two in San Francisco and one in Berkeley The Festival was heavily advertised in the local press particularly the free newspapers catering to the arts entertainment market Getting tickets was relatively easy provided you didn t wait too long many film screenings sold out Tickets were available by mail order early orders at the box offices once screenings began and from various ticketing agencies Besides organizing the annual festival the San Francisco International Film Festival organization also serves as a year round film society providing special screenings and sneak previews of many major films Most large cities have a film society and or a film festival and I would encourage you to investigate the services they provide The following sections provide mini reviews of 3 films from the Festival that I did not do full reviews of ranking of films seen comments on Festival films I wanted to see but couldn t and comments on Festival awards 1 Synopsis reviews of other previously unreviewed films screened at the Festival ROUGE Hong Kong 1987 In 1930 s Hong Kong a prostitute and her lover commit suicide together preferring to be together in hell rather than be separated by his disapproving parents After waiting 50 years for him to arrive in the after life she returns to modern Hong Kong as a ghost to search for him In her search she is aided by a modern day couple The premise is interesting but the overall result is mediocre The film spends too much time in flashbacks to the past whereas the events in the present are the most interesting ZAN BOKO Burkina Faso Upper Volta 1988 The land of a poor farmer is taken from him by his rich neighbor who wants it for a swimming pool A story of government corruption and censorship in an African setting The problem with the film is its incredibly slow pace which will bore most viewers Fans of African films might like it though IT S HAPPENING TOMORROW Italy 1988 Two cowboys bungle a robbery after which they are framed for a much larger theft They are pursued by mercenaries turned bounty hunters In their flight they encounter kidnappers royalty and some very strange people An offbeat frequently funny film that is rather uneven in style and pace Good but not a very good rating Some of their adventures are reminiscent of the fiction of Jules Verne 2 Rankings of films seen with comments as appropriate EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY The best film in the festival 100 camp humor 100 pure fun Theatrical release begins mid May PROJECT A II Action comedy that moves at warp speed THE CITADEL A look at life in a small Algerian village that is very interesting and very witty HARD TIMES Minimalist approach to Charles Dicken s work very well done EVENING BELL Very tense war drama will certainly hold your attention THE CANNIBALS Opera stars go cannibal Grand opera was never like this A savagely funny spoof TABATABA Deals with the 1947 Malagasy rebellion Very interesting THE VOYAGE BEYOND Deals with suttee ritual suicide of widows Slow moving but interesting a very complex story FAR FROM WAR Melodrama about the conflict between the generations in the new China Stunning landscape photography IT S HAPPENING TOMORROW The film is captivating for the first half then it falls on its face ROUGE Different editing and more time spent in the present could change this from a mediocre to a very good film ZAN BOKO Good message but told in a way that will bore most audiences LANDSCAPE IN THE MIST Disturbing depressing and occasionally disgusting Total yuck 3 Films I wanted to see but couldn t TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL Canada 1988 is described as a likely cult film or midnight movie my favorite kind It is some sort of folk tale where the people do such strange things as wash their faces with straw use fish oil squeezed from live fish as hair ointment and so on PROJECT A the 1984 Hong Kong film whose sequel PROJECT A II such an original name is extremely good These awards are restricted to non theatrical film video and television and are given each year by the San Francisco International Film Festival The awards are prestigious as they are selected in a competition that attracts hundreds of entries The list of awards is lengthy and I shall only mention two films that were reviewed in this newsgroup recently In the Film and Video Division category 1 Short Narrative the top award Best of Category was given to SUPERSTAR THE KAREN CARPENTER STORY This film is a docu drama of the life of pop singer Karen Carpenter done with a cast consisting entirely of Barbie dolls I reviewed the film and gave it a good recommendation in January in this group In the same Division category 6 Current Events a Special Jury Award translation 2nd prize was given to BEIRUT THE LAST HOME MOVIE a film that I reviewed in early March personally I think they should rename it Beirut The Last Boring Soap Opera If you do attend a film festival I give you only one piece of advice when choosing the films to see be adventurous and see some films that you might not ordinarily go to Admittedly you will be disappointed at times but you will also discover interesting and enjoyable films this way For example I had some reservations about seeing TABATABA and THE CITADEL However TABATABA was good and THE CITADEL was truly excellent You must take risks to make discoveries
0514,Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht,1979,Sometimes listed as NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE Synopsis Very classy and stylish version of the Dracula story A remake of the classic 1927 film by F W Murnau NOSFERATU Of interest to fans of vampire movies Germany German with English subtitles color 1979 Director Werner Herzog Principal cast Klaus Kinski Isabelle Adjani Bruno Ganz There is no need to detail the plot of this film other than to say that it is a very well made version of the classic novel DRACULA by Bram Stoker Klaus Kinski stars as the evil ghoul Count Dracula Kinski s Dracula has a shaved head and he wears white make up for a distinct ghoulish appearance According to the information available to me the film follows the original novel storyline very closely As such it may interest individuals who liked the book but not the numerous film versions that modify the story rewrite might be a more accurate description for many of the Dracula films The film has a gothic feel and is very well done There is very careful attention to detail and the film was shot on location in Eastern Europe One attraction of the film is its music done by the German group Popol Vuh Florian Fricke Daniel Fichelser Their music falls into the category that is now called new age although Popol Vuh began in 1971 as part of the early German electronic music scene The acting is excellent although it may be a bit understated Kinski s Dracula comes across as a very strange recluse rather than the flamboyant arrogant persona evident in other Dracula films This makes the story more believable This film is a staple at many repertory theatres Some theaters screen it several times a year usually pairing it with more recent vampire films When I last checked Fall 1988 it was not available on video although the 1927 silent version is available on video Overall evaluation very good Recommended if you want to see a quality Dracula film
0515,Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht,1979,This review originally appeared in 1979 It is included here as counterpoint to Thomas Billings s review Moderator To paraphrase JACOBOVSKY AND THE COLONEL Werner Herzog s new film NOSFERATU is one of the truly great films of the silent era While the film is a color film just barely and a sound film just barely it comes off as if Herzog had contritely decided to subject himself to the limitations and constraints of the pre sound classics The entire film is shot through a heavy blue filter leaving the photography with a bloodless lifeless feel It also makes minimal use of dialogue seemingly so as not to take unfair advantage over the original silent NOSFERATU It does however repeat many of the same scenes with camera angle and acting style intact The dialogue and there is not much more of it than one would find in a silent film is mostly delivered in a monotone and often seems inappropriately pseudo metaphysical A prematurely bloodless Lucy is prone to spontaneously give forth lines like Dr Van Helsing is it possible we are all insane and one day we will awake in strait jackets or I fear an inner nameless deadly dear Dracula too has his share of quotable bon mots such as Time is an abyss profound as a thousand nights The photography is much in the style of the silent film with fifteen second shots of characters devoid of motion or emotion These shots do provide considerable time to contemplate Klaus Kinski s vampire make up which looks like something between the original Schreck vampire and Milton Berle The only acting that involves the audience in any way but cerebrally is that of the constantly chuckling Renfield and that of a reluctant city official official who has a curious scene toward the end of the film reminiscent of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL Even though this film is indirectly based on DRACULA and has some excellent photography combining some of the style of German Expressionism and some of THE SEVENTH SEAL I cannot see the film having a wide general appeal in the United States It will go down well with the art film crowd and the rest of the viewing public will probably avoid it
0516,Killer Klowns from Outer Space,1988,Synopsis They came from outer space in a spaceship that looks like a circus tent They re aliens who look like circus clowns and they re here to kill They dispatch their victims with imagination style and circus magic An imaginative offbeat black comedy a very good midnight movie A shooting star blazes across the sky above a lover s lane landing nearby A young couple investigates only to find what appears to be a circus tent They discover that it is a spaceship run by aliens that look like circus clowns By good luck and running very fast the couple escape the clutches of the killer clowns and go to town to report their discovery to the police The clowns follow them into the town and begin a night of terror and murder Will the killer clowns take over the earth Will the young couple triumph Can humanity be saved See the film find out Despite the ridiculous premise or perhaps because of it this is a very funny film albeit with a savage sense of humor The stars of the film are a bunch of unknowns and the acting of the people in the film is rather poor However the clowns are very well done It is clear that the Director chose to spend his budget on make up and special effects This is for the good because it is the clowns that make this movie worth seeing The clowns are very large and look like ordinary clowns except for their sharp fanged teeth and large ears There are a few dwarf clowns also and there is a savagely funny scene where a dwarf killer clown on a clown bicycle terrorizes an entire motorcycle gang Given that the humor here concerns murders the film is definitely a black comedy If it is a parody or take off on anything it is more a parody of slasher films than science fiction Rather than someone in a hockey mask FRIDAY THE 13TH series or Freddie Krueger we have a bunch of clowns committing the murders However the methods the clowns use to dispatch their victims are imaginative inventive and outrageously funny I won t say anymore on this point to avoid spoiling anything The Chiodo brothers writers producers and director deserve high marks for the originality and imagination shown in this film An examination of the production values of this film indicates that it is definitely a B movie The acting of the people but not the clowns is poor the script occasionally weak only the outrageous clowns their equally outrageous antics save the movie The clowns are so silly that when you see them it is hard not to laugh Despite the limitations of the film it is worth watching assuming you have the properly warped sense of humor just to see the clowns and their antics If you like midnight movies this is definitely worth seeing If you don t like midnight movies then perhaps you shouldn t see it Overall evaluation very good for a midnight movie P S This film is now available on video You might consider viewing it late at night with a group of people who like this kind of humor
0517,Lair of the White Worm The,1988,Ken Russell has taken the theme of the survival of a pre Christian cult of snake worship from Bram Stoker s last novel intertwined it with the mediaeval legend of the Lambton Worm from Durham north east England to give us a quirky fantasy thriller with one of the most beguiling and sensual of villainesses to stalk the screen in some considerable time The film is set in the Derbyshire countryside and starts with the discovery of a large reptilian skull by student archaeologist Angus Flint who is excavating on the site of a Roman settlement near the local guest house The guest house is now run by Eve and Mary Trent since their parents disappeared the previous year while out walking This coincides with the return to his estate of Lord D Ampton and also of the mysterious and exotic Lady Sylvia Marsh from her regular winter sojourn in parts unknown Lady Sylvia is in fact the most recent reincarnation of the High Priestess of the snake god Dionyn and is herself part snake being able to sprout fangs and spit venom as the mood takes her her return in the spring to her country home at Temple House is in order to offer worship and sacrifice to the deity The central characters it seems are fated to repeatedly conflict as James D Ampton is a descendant of a knight who is reputed to have slain one manifestation of the D Ampton Worm in ages past whereas Eve Trent is an unknowing re embodiment of the spirit of a nun whose order attempted to build a convent on the site of Dionyn s temple during the time of the Roman occupation The film is hardly a serious attempt at the horror genre and the more entertaining because of that the script is littered with double meanings especially Lady Sylvia s dialogue as she revels in turns of phrase which appear innocuous to her listener but on which she is putting a quite different interpretation She could be seen as an archetypal psychopath intelligent gracious and charming beautiful sensual and amoral without the slightest compunction in killing those who cease to amuse her There are also various visual nudges in the ribs such as the ornaments on the mantelpiece in Lady Sylvia s living room and the most peculiar items included in the buffet at Lord D Ampton s party Generally the humour in the script works well and is comfortable in context as in the delightful repartee at the doorway when James D Ampton first calls upon Lady Sylvia and the eccentric performance by Stratford Johns as the butler although perhaps Mr Russell oversteps a bit when while watching her snakes and ladders board burning in the fireplace Lady Sylvia whispers Rosebud The lightness in the script does however tend to reduce the tension in the plot and it is undoubtedly a certain lack of suspense which would be my only real reservation about the film Also the character of Lady Sylvia is so strong and none of the others are developed enough to match her that the story sometimes falls a bit flat when Ms Donohoe is off screen one seriously doubts the ability of the protagonists to defeat the snake woman and it is only by the most exceptional luck that most of them don t end up being fed to the Worm anyway Of course there are some serious problems with the suspension of disbelief the logistics of keeping an immense snake supplied with human sacrifices even one which hibernates for half of the year would surely have brought Lady Sylvia s activities to someone s attention much sooner I seriously doubt that Derby county hospital could produce an antivenin to an unknown snake venom in the twelve hours or so required in the film James D Ampton deduces Lady Sylvia s involvement in the abduction of Eve and the continued survival of the Worm on the flimsiest of evidence and there is no way he could have known that she would find snake charming music so hypnotic as up until then he had no reason to believe she was anything other than a normal if rather unpredictable woman but as the whole of the night time section starting with the plan to charm Lady Sylvia from her house so that it can be searched for the missing Eve is probably the best in the film apart from the final battle who am I to complain Of course there is no reason not to accept all the daftness the cinema is for entertainment after all As one might expect in a film where the monster is a huge snake and the heroine is called Eve sexual symbolism is an integral part of the plot although never really to excess except perhaps in the violent flashback sequences ravished nuns wrestling air hostesses white clad virgins and dildoes of the most disconcerting dimensions all make an appearance and Lady Sylvia gives the wickedest love bites The special effects by Image Animation are good and never intrusive except perhaps during the short chaotic flashbacks when Mr Russell foregoes his usual commendable restraint the Worm itself although only seen full size during the climax of the final battle is satisfyingly horrendous So overall on a scale of 10 a fair 7 for the film as a whole and a definite 9 for Ms Donohoe s performance as the exquisitely decadent Lady Sylvia Marsh Forget about reality for 90 minutes or so go see it
0521,Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure,1989,Well I have to make it unanimous There is something disarmingly pleasant about BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE and it is certainly a very funny film though it gets by on a premise I usually find tedious to the extreme in a comedy In other words the Laughing at the Dolts syndrome where the main source of humor is a group of individuals so dumb that you laugh at them For instance I don t like the Three Stooges Jerry Lewis or any film with Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise together But but there s something about Bill and Ted two clueless dudes from southern California whose rather dense reactions to the most bizarre circumstances kept me a grinnin throughout the majority of the picture I do admit that the premise got things off to a good start it turns out that Bill and Ted s music will someday bring Earth to an age of Utopia water slides and everything dude but without the help of their ancestors they ll flunk their history paper and be split up when Ted s dad sends him to the military academy The paper which is supposed to be an exposition on how various historical figures were react to being introduced to the California mini mall culture is turned into a research project when Bill and Ted are handed a time machine and decide to go bag some historical figures dude You can take it from there While much of the humor from comes from watching Bill and Ted s single minded quest there s a pleasant humorous aura around the rest of the film Little background details like Billy the Kid and Socrates learning to play Nerf Football in the background and Bill s reaction to his step mother nubile and only a few years older than himself add a gentler strain of humor than some of the more apparent slapstick There are slow spots the trip to the future and some gratuitous water sliding by Napoleon but the rest is constantly entertaining with even a few time travel tricks I ve never seen done in a film before and taken to a fairly hilarious point Sure I could say that seeing Abraham Lincoln saying Party on dudes made it all worth while But that would be selling BILL AND TED way short Hell there s 50 zillion summer films heading your way at breakneck speed get a little spring humor under your belt before you try swallowing a BATMAN and STAR TREK combo And remember be excellent to one another
0522,Lawrence of Arabia,1962,Within a week I ve doused myself in the fountain of film retrospectives to wit seeing the restored versions of GONE WITH THE WIND and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA Both of these are film classics in the strictest sense of the term both are epics both have intermissions thank God and both are noted for all star casts and memorable scores and impressive cinematography And both of them while entertaining diversions struck me as being less impressive than I had expected from the superlative comments that have been written about them though one was far more disappointing than the other First GONE WITH THE WIND Not having read the novel by Margaret Mitchell nor having any particular wish to hint hint I can t comment on how well I thought the actors played their particular roles If I have to give Victor Fleming credit for anything it s the way he frames a shot zooming slowly backwards to reveal the lines of wounded men in Atlanta and the Confederate flag zooming back to take in the staircase of the Wilkes estate Come to think of it was GWTW Fleming s vessel for introducing the world to the use of the zoom shot Or the back lit shadowed figures framing If he d used the zoom lens any more often it would have looked like one of SCTV s old 3D movie spoofs Yeah the Technicolor s impressive as heck and Gable s performance rarely sunk into ham acting and Vivian Leigh had a few good scenes too But most of the writing isn t that impressive and much of the acting is just plain mediocre I ve seen Leslie Howard in PYGMALION and I know he can act and direct but you wouldn t know it from this I can see why they picked Olivia De Havilland for Melly though by the time this was shot she had the goody two shoes chipmunk look down pat I d have to put De Havilland down as one of the three actors I d have the most fun with if I dubbed over their dialogue Okay let s get down to brass tacks It s one big long soap opera Sure the first half has some epic parts but the second half is all bubbles and then everybody decent dies in the final reel Two women sitting next to me were crying during the last half hour Now I cry at movies at some pretty stupidest things Remember Vincent Spano s girlfriend reviving at the last minute in CREATOR Eyes got runny and everything Yeah I know what a sap But for these characters There s not a sympathetic one in the bunch and certainly not Scarlett Must be a side effect of all that zoom lens action Now LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is another thing It definitely is an epic and it uses the land as a symbol more powerfully in a single frame than 20 minutes of Vivian Leigh holding up soil in the air while the camera zoooooms back anyway I saw it in 70MM and visually it is fantastic The panoramas the scenes of unbelievable scope approaching the Bedouin camp I kept thinking This must be a matte It wasn t the aftermath of the battle with the Turks This is a masterpiece of what can be done with a camera and some damn talented actors It s also an amazing performance by O Toole though I had thought from other reviewers comments that his character would be considered more heroic and or tragic I came away with the feeling that this was a man without all his marbles in one knapsack to begin with and his combination of delusions and conscience strive to send him completely off his bean A little bit of lithium and think of the wonders he could have achieved I also thought that some of the desert battle scenes dragged on a bit but that could be a because of the added footage or b my allergies were in full swing and I came home to discover I was running a slight temperature So take into account a small bit of crankiness In short I went to both these films expecting to see something special only in LAWRENCE did I find what I was expecting If the latter arrives in your town especially in 70MM do not miss it As to GONE WITH THE WIND wait for it to come on television again then you ll be able to say you ve seen it and get some ironing done while you re watching
0523,Skin Deep,1989,Through the years Blake Edwards has made some outrageously funny films Remember all the Pink Panther movies More recently he has also made some very funny films like S O B 10 and VICTOR VICTORIA His latest directorial effort is entitled SKIN DEEP This is a film about a married successful writer and musician John Ritter who decides to engage in the art of infidelity This new hobby of his succeeds until his wife unexpectedly catches him fooling around He soon gets ousted from his happy home He is later seen explaining all of his female encounters to his psychiatrist This motion picture features Vincent Gardenia MOONSTRUCK as his friend It also features Julianne Phillips the former Mrs Bruce Springsteen and Denise Crosby as two of his female conquests He soon learns the meaning to the saying Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned This film simply stated is a light romantic comedy It is not really Blake Edwards best work but it does contain a few funny moments This advertisement for this film promotes a scene that they say is too sexy to be mentioned on television Well it is too sexy for me to mention it here either All I can say is that it is probably the funniest scene in the movie
0525,Say Anything...,1989,There must be at least a hundred high school dating movies made each year by Hollywood since there are about two new ones on cable each week It would be very easy to assume that this type of film had been all mined out and that there was not much more that could be done with it But in fact there is always room in any genre for a film of fresh and well observed characters Humans like looking at humans and seeing how humans behave James Bonds are fun to watch too or sexy mannequins doing unrealistic things under some circumstances but a film that shows fresh and real people will always be a joy to watch SAY ANYTHING is unique and a very human comedy drama Diane Court played by Ione Skye has it all She is class valedictorian she has won a prestigious fellowship to study in England she is beautiful and in all probability she has butterscotch in her veins Lloyd Dobler played by John Cusack is not good looking and is below average in his class He has no goals except to be a better kick boxer and to date Diane Sound familiar Except for the valedictorian part it has been done hundreds of times Give the film half an hour and you will start to like this film a lot better particularly James Court played superbly by John Mahoney who goes from bemused at Lloyd to protective of his daughter through a lot more changes until he becomes the focal point of the film SAY ANYTHING goes from a teen comedy to a very solid drama of human interaction The writer director of SAY ANYTHING is Cameron Crowe who is best known for screenwriting FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH based on his novel of the same name That film was about 90 teen comedy but had a surprisingly solid piece of human drama at its core This time the comedy is more even balanced with the drama SAY ANYTHING joins TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and BROADCAST NEWS as a James L Brooks produced film of a woman choosing between love and loyalty That may of course be coincidental but because each triangle is resolved in a different and believable way the films make an excellent trilogy Through unlike Debra Winger and Holly Hunter Ione Skye cannot quite hold her own for audience interest against the other two vertices While it is not quite the strength of a BROADCAST NEWS nor probably TERMS OF ENDEARMENT though I am not as fond of that film SAY ANYTHING does the nearly impossible of making a satisfying film from a high school dating comedy I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0526,Cyborg,1989,Recipe for CYBORG Take one cup of CONAN THE BARBARIAN and two pints of MAD MAX and mix in a large container Slowly add a tablespoon of the TERMINATOR and the slightest dash of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK Blend in poor directing pitiful acting and a horrible script and plot Sit for an hour and a half Serves no purpose CYBORG is set in a post destruction earth Starvation genocide and the plague have reduced the earth to an anarchist state The few remaining scientists are nearing a cure for the plague if only some data can be retrieved from Atlanta But there are these bad guys you see who like the pain and death This is undisputedly the worst movie I have paid to see in the last five years and I ve seen some poor movies The plot was embarrassingly predictable The script was terrible This is a must see film for a class on How Not to Write a Script The dialogue between characters sounded like outtakes of every doom and destruction film produced in the last ten years Even the technical parts of this film were bad The special effects were mediocre Three minutes after any major wounding of a character the wounds had healed and a nice neat scar had replaced them The sound during the fight scenes was off resulting in a punching sound followed immediately by the punch The punches and kicks by the way were filmed so poorly that you could see as much as a two foot gap between the fist of the person throwing the punch and the face of the person receiving the punch This movie was so bad that it had a four minute flashback that they showed twice in its entirety They had old rusted cars throughout the planet that were smoldering and had obviously been smoldering for the last ten or twelve years In places where the special effects were particularly poor they made the picture blurry to cover up their errors I recommend this movie to absolutely no one not even fans of this type of film Wait for RED SCORPIONS starring Dolph Lundgren it looks as though it will be exciting enough to hold you over until the next Schwarzenegger action film This movie on the other hand will do nothing but disappoint you Rate it a 3 5 on the Leeper scale
0527,Cyborg,1989,CYBORG belongs to a small sub genre the Science Fiction Martial Arts film This sub genre is larger than might be supposed since it includes all those terrible gladiators in a future arena movies such as DEATH RACE 2000 and AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK Another recent example is STEEL DAWN which has a slightly more substantial SF plot than the various death races A 1 film that fits into this sub genre is THE RUNNING MAN which featured Arnold Schwarzenegger duking it out on a game show with hockey stick wielding psychos These films as a group are poorly made and exhibit low quality unrealistic fighting Recently a number of martial artists have attempted to put on the screen a higher level of realism in fighting The two major examples are Steven Senegal an Akidoist starring in ABOVE THE LAW and Jean Claude Van Damme in BLOODSPORT Neither film has a very strong or believable plot but both contain excellent fight scenes that are well above the typical Hollywood slam bang A digression into the world of stunt fighting is called for at this point Hopefully movie audiences are aware that movie fights are carefully planned to maximize the breakage to surrounding walls tables lamps etc to increase the drama of the moment Another Hollywoodism is that scene where the hero punched kicked many times by the villain draws from deep within themselves the resources to go on and win Another Hollywoodism is the villain gaining the upper hand and then squandering it to explain their plans for world domination or just getting the girl guy A final Hollywoodism is that in spite of all the slam bang people just dust themselves off and escape more or less unharmed Jean Claude Van Damme plans a ninjitsu trained fighter Frank Dux in BLOODSPORT who enters a secret illegal no rules all styles contest The framing plot is about 3 the training scenes about 0 level but the fights are 2 They are excellently filmed diverse and very well thought out Van Damme is an extremely flexible martial artist who clearly has mastery of an enviable variety of techniques He is pleasing on the screen and seems fairly convincing in his relatively simple roll Much of the impetus of the story derives from the knowledge that it is supposedly true a Frank Dux really exists who claims to have won just such an underground tournament I have read interviews with Dux and apparently the fights are fairly close to what he claims actually happened BLOODSPORT was a very low budget film that played surprisingly well and propelled Van Damme into the limelight With this background it was with bated breath that a tiny group of fans of SF Martial Arts awaited CYBORG a new SF movie starring Van Damme It should be noted that there is also a written branch of SF martial arts notably STREETLETHAL and THE KUNDALINI EQUATION by real life Kung fu stylist Steven Barnes who co authored DREAM PARK with Larry Niven Other examples include MATADORA and THE MAN WHO NEVER MISSED by Steve Perry and to some extent all cyber punk but especially NEUROMANCER JOHNNY MNEMONIC HARDWIRED and VOICE OF THE WHIRLWIND Variety reviewed CYBORG as just a series of futuristic fights This would have been a considerable improvement In fact there is just enough plot to seriously impede the fights CYBORG resembles MAD MAX in that they are both revenge tales with colorful villains set in a violent post holocaust world Both have boring and ill conceived sets of flashbacks to the bucolic days the hero spent with a wife girlfriend who eventually gets wasted by the colorful villain Both have a few good scenes here and there but overall are very poor films There are several things that make CYBORG much worse than it should have been One is that Van Damme s female sidekick is totally miscast She should have been played by an unknown but technically proficient female martial artist who had some minimal acting skills Instead she is played by your basic movie bimbo Her continued survival in spite of her obvious lack of martial skill and general stupidity greatly decreases the credibility of the film Another problem is that a lot of CYBORG builds up to a big fight between Van Damme and a colorful villain There is nothing wrong with this but unfortunately all the interesting fighting takes place between Van Damme and various henchmen about mid way through the film Many of these scenes were fairly realistic and well executed Unfortunately when Van Damme confronts the main villain he forgets all the skills he displayed earlier and behaves like someone who knows zip about what he is doing The same pattern is repeated in their final confrontation Basically both fights are pure Hollywood and a considerable waste of the audience s time I also should mention that the dialog is not very good and many scenes are mis directed although production values are higher than in most low budget films It is unfortunate that CYBORG is not better than it is since it may sink Van Damme s career Overall CYBORG comes in as a low 1 or high 2 The squeamish are reminded that although CYBORG is not a splatter film it is R rated for a reason and it is fairly violent
0528,Taketori monogatari,1987,Synopsis In feudal Japan a poor bamboo cutter finds an abandoned infant girl He raises her as his daughter and she grows up to be a beautiful young woman The nobles at the Emperor s court compete for her hand in marriage but there is a problem she is really from the moon Japan Japanese with English subtitles color 1987 121 minutes Director Kon Ichikawa Principal cast Toshiro Mifune Ayako Wakao Yasuko Sawaguchi Print Source Toho International Ltd This film is based on a popular children s story in Japan Taketori monogatari the tale of the bamboo cutter The story concerns a poor bamboo cutter played by Toshiro Mifune who finds a child inside a metal container that strongly resembles a giant bamboo sprout in the forest It turns out to be a young girl and she looks just like his recently deceased infant daughter Kaya The bamboo cutter and his wife accept the girl as a divine gift and raise her as their own daughter of course they name her Kaya Kaya quickly grows up to become an extremely beautiful young woman and three of the nobles in the Emperor s court propose marriage to her The nobles compete with each other in performing incredible feats to win her hand in marriage However there is a serious problem she is an extra terrestrial and she must return to the moon her real home This film is a bit unusual in that there is plenty to both like and dislike in it Let me deal with the negatives first At 121 minutes it is a bit too long Although it is generally interesting the story line moves rather slowly at times Portions of the film were out of focus it is not clear whether that was a film or projection problem Finally certain parts of the film are clear imitations of another film Spielberg s CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE BORING KIND obviously I m not a Spielberg fan Fortunately this film is far more interesting than the tedious and pretentious CLOSE ENCOUNTERS In terms of quality the film is comparable to the very best made for television movies On the positive side the film is relatively interesting and one can immediately identify with many of the main characters Some but not all of the special effects are good The film is very sentimental and will produce a positive emotional reaction in most viewers Thus I expect that despite its technical flaws most viewers will find the film worth seeing Overall evaluation good Worthy of consideration for its sentimental value a nice story
0529,Yari no gonza,1986,Synopsis In Japan in the 1700 s a young samurai warrior and the wife of a noble are accused of committing adultery Under the prevailing social code the noble must kill his wife to avenge his honor The samurai and the woman flee and are pursued by her husband A tragic story of jealousy and honor laced with a dose of lust Japan Japanese with English subtitles color 1988 126 minutes Director Masahiro Shinoda Principal cast Hiromi Go Shima Iwashita Shohei Hino Print Source Schochiku Films of America The rather clumsy title of this film is a literal translation of the title of the play on which it is based Yari no Gonza The play was written by Monzaemon Chikamatsu the Shakespeare of Japan The resulting film is well made and interesting perhaps the word elegant might apply The story centers on Gonza an ambitious young samurai warrior Gonza is very handsome and is favored by women In order to advance in the service of his clan Gonza must learn and practice the tea ceremony an elaborate social ritual Gonza competes with another man for the privilege of performing the tea ceremony for the clan leader To make things more complicated the man Gonza competes with is the brother of the woman he is engaged to Since Gonza is to perform the tea ceremony on behalf of Ichinoshin a noble who is in Edo feudal Tokyo he asks to see the family tea scrolls This is normally permitted only for family members Ichinoshin s wife Osai agrees on the condition that Gonza agrees to marry her 15 year old daughter thereby joining the family Despite his engagement to another Gonza agrees to the marriage Gonza comes late at night to examine the scrolls He is observed by his rival who runs through town proclaiming that Gonza and Osai have committed adultery To avoid the wrath of Ichinoshin who by social custom must kill both Osai and Gonza to preserve his honor they flee and hide Ichinoshin follows and searches for them This is a tragic melodrama dealing with honor social duty love lust and jealousy Although the first hour drags on at times with a slow moving and rather convoluted plot the second hour will definitely hold your attention It is not the best samurai melodrama that I have seen but overall it is really very good Now comes the tricky question is it recommended for a general audience First of all if you are looking for a samurai action film like for example YOJIMBO then you are cautioned that this is not that sort of film This is a melodrama it is not the samurai equivalent of a kung fu movie Second the film is an adaptation of a stage play with all the inherent limitations therein The overall quality of the film is good but it is not one of the best of the year or even best of its class Third to fully understand and appreciate the film it is helpful to have some knowledge of Japanese history and customs in the period Melodramas like this are standard fare on Japanese television Having spent considerable time in Japan I am acquainted with the material and acquired a taste for it Despite the universal themes addressed in the story I wonder whether a general audience will fully appreciate the unique social background that drives the tragedy Overall evaluation good Recommended to those with some knowledge of the period and adventuresome viewers willing to take a risk on a samurai melodrama
0531,Red Scorpion,1989,Moderator s Note I am in the process of changing machines for news My old address will still work as well as my new one ecl Every time I go strolling through the paperback section of the Corvallis Fred Meyer department store I do this mostly out of habit since I lost interest in novels a long time ago I notice one section is devoted to what for want of a better term I would call male Harlequins Women apparently like to read slushy romances men on the other hand like to read violent action novels These violent action books have titles like MIA HUNTER or SAIGON COMMANDOS or whatever There s a whole rack of em and they re usually numbered as elements of a series Mind you I m not criticizing these books People write them and make a living People buy them and kill some time with them Everyone s happy Some may claim that such books have a pernicious effect on the character of those who read them but as a concern I personally have to place that somewhere below the potential toxicity of my tooth fillings There are movies that seem to fall in this category as well and there I would solidly place RED SCORPION In this film Scandinavian hunk Dolf Lundgren plays a Soviet SPETSNATZ commando sent to some mythical African nation Mombassa or Mikubu or what the hell something like that to help suppress a rebellion He eventually realizes that he s fighting on the wrong side and helps the rebels And you ask And what I reply That s really all there is to it It s sort of like a WWII vintage propaganda flic with the sadistic and brutal Russians and Cubans oppressing the noble African freedom fighters It s all pretty much by the numbers violence combat torture fistfights lots and lots of fiery explosions I didn t mind myself I had a frustrating week and I wanted to go park my brains for a while before I blew a fuse and bit the mailman I knew what I was getting into and got exactly what I expected RED SCORPION has zero pretensions of being anything but what it is and makes no false claims in its advertising Anybody who goes to see this movie with high expectations will be disappointed but I would have to say that would be like picking up a paperback like DELTA FORCE RAIDERS and expecting to read WAR AND PEACE Still it would be nice to see some movies that I don t forget the instant I walk out the door But BARON MUNCHAUSEN hasn t made it to the provinces yet so I guess I ll just have to satisfy myself by writing reviews
0532,Red Scorpion,1989,RED SCORPION R violence language Dolph ROCKY IV MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE Lundgren stars as Nicolai the most respected and dangerous member of a super elite Soviet military special forces group Nicolai is ordered to end a growing rebellion in Soviet and Cuban controlled Africa His mission is to befriend a captured member of the African rebellion and use that friendship to gain entry into the rebels main camp As soon as Nicolai is trusted and in the camp he is to assassinate their leader The movie centers around Nicolai s struggle with his orders At first he is an unwavering soldier acting not on what he feels but on what he is told But he soon develops a growing resistance to the sanctity of his orders and finally a disgust for the Soviet and Cuban oppression in Africa Lundgren gives a respectable performance as Nicolai making much of the movie seem believable It is this performance that makes the movie worthwhile Removing Nicolai s personal struggle would reduce the quality and interest of this film significantly But Lundgren does portray a very human and interesting character Of particular interest is his interaction with and old African bushmen Without the benefits of a common language these two develop a unique bond between each another that provides the most memorable sequence in the film But don t get too excited this movie could have been better It was unbelievable in a few parts and technically poor in others However considering the budget and targeted audience this movie reaches its goals It is an entertaining and interesting film that although somewhat predictable manages to interject little pieces of human nature into the somewhat tired and worn subject of weak rebels led by a strong outsider against a common foe If you like this type of movie you will probably enjoy this film
0533,Sagolandet,1988,With Johanna Rollo May Ingvar Carlsson Tage Erlander Gert Wilen Lars Svelander Timo Nilsson Henry Karlsson Dorte Hansen Per Olof Hakannson Harold Lundstrom Einar Carenfeldt Stig Karlsson Anita Grede Seved Werntoft Lars Norrman Hideaki Yoshiguchi Britta Nylander Anna Lisa Floren Nils Erik Ahmansson Edvin Bladh The Sprung Family and many others Credits Directed and photographed by Jan Troell Executive producer Bengt Linne Assistant producer Goran Setterberg Assistants Mischa Gavrjusjov Botvid Kihlman Agneta Ulfsater Original music by Tom Wolgers Ever since Ingmar Bergman retired from active filmmaking most Americans have had precious little contact with Swedish cinema In fact Lasse Hallstrom s MITT LIV SOM HUND My Life as a Dog is the only Swedish film to have recently gained commercial distribution in the United States Ironically that charming and poignant film reintroduced Americans to Swedish cinema just as a wave of quality Swedish filmmaking was ending Swedish cinema went into a slump in the mid 1980s and like the state of American cinema during the 1930s quietly ambitious documentaries like Stefan Jarl s UHKKADUS Threat have since become the prime source for innovation and vitality in Sweden today Jan Troell s SAGOLANDET Land of Dreams is another of these new documentaries but there is nothing quiet about it In less than ten minutes it completely surpasses any expectations one might have for a 185 minute documentary about life in modern day Sweden At once intensely personal and of universal value the film is a masterpiece of lyricism that transcends its immediate relevance the film not only keeps the spirit of originality and creativity alive but also sets a new standard of excellence for documentary filmmaking The film is so successful as a whole that its momentary lapses are easily forgiven and quickly forgotten Time and time again Troell s film paints a bleak picture of Sweden as a nation where order rationality and efficiency take precedence over happiness joy and imagination Troell also protests that the long record of human violence against the environment has in turn dehumanized humans themselves and the film yearns for a Land of Dreams that would encourage people to explore their individual potential rather than stifle it This theme might be summarized as the value of imagination versus the benefits of rationality and Troell addresses it with considerably more thought and attention than the typical get back to nature message or simplistic anti technology diatribe Furthermore Troell is eminently successful in translating the film s thematic generalities into terms particularly relevant to the Sweden of today Sweden can be rightly proud of its rich artistic heritage considering that it has produced such international giants among others as Strindberg in the theater and Sjostrom and Bergman in the cinema It would be easy for foreigners to conclude that any country able to produce such world reknowned artists must have something special going for it and there is indeed something fascinating about Swedish culture It is difficult to pin down but part of what makes Sweden so intriguing is its strong liberal tradition Following that tradition the country has made giant strides toward securing political and economic security for all its citizens In fact progressive reformers in other countries have long pointed to Sweden as the success story of the modern welfare state At the same time however few foreigners seem to realize that Sweden s longstanding material prosperity has brought along with it a certain sense of coldness emptiness and even sterility This is the fundamental contradiction of Swedish culture and Troell astutely recognizes that it has several dimensions ranging from the broadly political and economic to the personal and practical As a Swede himself Troell explores all of these considerations from inside out and gives passionate expression to their implications Because Troell engages his viewers with both personal and cultural introspection his film is already praiseworthy in and of itself If that were all he wanted to do however he might as well have written a book or acted out a drama on stage What makes Troell s work into into a particularly valuable work of cinema is the intimate and symbiotic relationship between the film s cinematic styles and Troell s reasons for making the film Each benefits the other and Troell consistently manipulates the two brilliantly Consider for example just the first five minutes of the film The film begins with a ground level closeup of a red flower waving back and forth in the wind An unseen adult male narrator presumably Troell himself says in Swedish that As a child I would stand in the grass with outstretched arms my face toward the sun Then I d close my eyes and spin round round I felt then that I experienced God The film cuts to a slow motion shot of a young boy jumping around in a field of white flowers in obvious delight On the soundtrack a piano softly plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Then the film cuts to a right profile shot of a well dressed elderly man who speaks in English with an American accent Joy is the experience of something new that one has not known before Happiness is the fulfillment of one s past aims The joy is the the discovery of new aims the sense of being in a new country The film cuts back to the young boy jumping and twirling about again in slow motion This time two puppies cavort at his feet with him and the final movement of Beethoven s Choral Symphony is heard joyously on the soundtrack Abruptly the music stops and the film cuts to a full body shot of a scarecrow made of some black clothes erected on a wooden cross Ominous synthesizer chords begin to play on the soundtrack The camera zooms back slowly to show the bleak barren landscape that the scarecrow guards Then the title SAGOLANDET appears on screen written in large black letters that are split vertically in half like early computer printout characters The letters fade and the film continues on Clearly Troell is combining lyrical moments with strong documentary footage in these scenes and he makes the most each element The opening narration over the red flower immediately stresses the value of childlike imagination and wonder Troell drives home the difference between joy and happiness by delimiting the elderly man s observations between shots of the boy twirling about happily The man is by the way the American psychiatrist Rollo May and Troell relies on him heavily throughout the film The bleak field suggests the spiritual emptiness of the rational landscape because it allows environmental folly exemplified by the barren field to occur Finally the computer like font of the title letters creates tension by suggesting that the film is a down to earth documentary examination of a thoroughly mystical or magical place the Land of Dreams The above analysis though barely begins to convey the tightly coherent structure Troell has created by editing 80 hours of raw footage down to 185 minutes Just after the opening credits are over for example Troell includes footage of a dog show Some time later the film shows loggers using a large machine to cut down forest trees in less than 10 seconds each Another sequence follows a professional dogkiller at a dog pound as he calmly explains their policy on putting stray dogs to death A third sequence explains how loggers use a powerful bolt gun to shoot glyphosate capsules into birch and aspen trees The glyphosate slowly kills the trees to make room for more profitable pine trees The same bolt gun the film shows is used by the dog pound to dispatch stray dogs instantly and painlessly These seemingly disparate moments are in reality closely related because they show how the single minded pursuit of efficiency can transform passive dominance of humans over nature into active destruction Troell is at his poetic best while pointing out such relationships and the above sequence is but one example of how intricately Troell has linked segments of his film together In terms of overall structure the film is divided into several sections Each section focuses on a specific place idea or group of individuals and then cuts back to quiet philosophical commentary by Rollo May the American psychiatrist or political arguments between Ingvar Carlsson and Tage Erlander With impeccable documentary technique Troell gets his subjects to open up to the camera and his editing zeroes in on the essence of each conversation Who is being interviewed is nowhere near as important as what he or she is saying and so most Americans won t realize that Carlsson is the prime minister of Sweden and that Erlander is a former prime minister which is as it should be Neither look like talk like or act like typical politicians which is probably why Troell was interested in interviewing them in the first place Also seen throughout the film is Johanna Troell s young daughter whom Troell began photographing from birth In the film he shows her learning to walk climbing stairs riding happily on a circus merry go round Not once however does the film resemble a home movie Rather Troell photographs Johanna to express his own joy in the true Rollo May sense of the word at becoming a father for the first time at age 50 Troell can share his intensely personal emotions with viewers in a meaningful way because espousing the value of those feelings is precisely the point of Troell s film The presence of Johanna throughout the film powerfully underscores how inseparable Jan Troell is from his film The two are one and the same No other filmmaker in recent memory has created an intimate document with so broad a value as this SAGOLANDET supplants factual objectivity with poetic creativity and therefore works in markedly different ways from the typical cinema verite documentary While one might not wholly agree with Troell s point of view or the film s numerous arguments the film that flows from Troell s convictions judged as a work of art is an indisputable masterpiece In addition the film embodies the very same qualities that it says are missing from Swedish society and therefore the film preserves its integrity and consistency at the same time that it adopts a leadership role Few documentaries can claim to accomplish as much For all of these reasons and for many others left out SAGOLANDET is a crowning achievement of international cinema and a supreme personal triumph for Jan Troell One can only wonder to what heights Troell might climb from here Filmography of Jan Troell English translation and alternative titles in brackets S indicates a short film Jan Troell is a veteran Swedish filmmaker who is well known for lyricism in his work Born in Malmo in 1931 he taught in an elementary school in Malmo during the early 1950s and made instructional films for children in the late 1950s He began making documentaries for Swedish television in the 1960s and made his feature film debut in 1966 He belongs to the generation of Swedish filmmakers such as Bo Widerberg that came of age in the 1960s and he photographs all his films himself
0534,See You in the Morning,1989,Capsule review At last we are starting to see three dimensional people with genuine problems returning to films SEE YOU IN THE MORNING overcomes some narrative problems to tell a believable slice of life story Rating low 2 Fifteen years ago there were a lot of films like SEE YOU IN THE MORNING Three years ago it was much more of a rarity at least from United States films Now knock wood we are starting to see a few more films from the American film industry that admit there are problems in life that cannot be solved by a karate kick by a machine gun or by winning the big race or a dance competition I have to admit to being partial toward the former sort of film since none of my problems ever seem amenable to the latter sorts of solutions SEE YOU IN THE MORNING is about re marriage not actually one of my problems thank God It is about the strains that frustrate second marriages The principal characters here are not real people the widow of a famous concert pianist the ex husband of a famous covergirl but they are real ish The story is somewhat convoluted It begins by showing two marriages with problems starting then jumps forward three years to when Beth the wife from one marriage is marrying Larry the husband from the other Then for 45 minutes or so flashbacks fill the audience in on the interim then the film continues linearly This disorients the viewer who is not always sure when a scene is taking place Larry meets Beth at a party and discovers all they have in common To start with they each have a headache About a third of the film is spent showing how Larry courts Beth as often as not with cockeyed stunts Then the film gets down to the serious question of whether a man can be grafted onto a family that has lost a father We see this question from almost every aspect and angle making one wonder if writer director Alan Pakula has not actually been through it all We see the jealousy of the previous spouses we see how the children react to the step father we see the half hidden urge to return to former spouses While some of the stunts early on seem a little stagey for most of the film the characters behave in very human ways You see warm human moments and cold spiteful ones Larry a successful psychiatrist played by Jeff Bridges does his earnest best to overcome rejection by his second family Not everything works for him the way it does in the movies He makes mistakes with the best of intentions sometimes Alice Krige plays Beth She may be a little glamorous as a photographer who gets offered trips to Russia and who always looks like Candice Bergen at her best Around them are a collection of people well drawn and each unique This one is worth seeing I give it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0535,Field of Dreams,1989,Capsule review A complex and witty fantasy film that features great performances by James Earl Jones and Kevin Costner Even if you do not like our stupid national pastime this film about ghosts of the White Sox and a quest is a solidly entertaining fantasy Rating low 3 I do not like baseball And because I do not like baseball baseball films do not work on me as well as they do on other people Most baseball movies assume that there is something somehow noble about playing baseball I don t buy that A good baseball for me is one that would still be good if you substituted professional wrestling as the game PRIDE OF THE YANKEES just does not stack up very well under this criterion You have to consider baseball important to respect Gehrig BULL DURHAM is an okay but not great character comedy BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY would still be a good study of the relationship of two men I find that even with no respect for baseball THE NATURAL remains a fine fantasy allegory of talent and treachery of darkness and light Now another baseball fantasy has come along with enough human values enough fine acting and a good enough script that it is well worth seeing even if like me you hate baseball FIELD OF DREAMS is a real surprise a usually genuine piece of quality writing for the screen Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella a would be ball player s son a college activist in the late 1960s and now an Iowa farmer One day while working in the field he hears a disembodied voice tell him If you build it he will come After days of puzzling over hearing the message repeated he has a vision that the he is Shoeless Joe Jackson of the White Sox and incidentally of EIGHT MEN OUT a personal hero of Ray s dead father It seems to refer to a baseball diamond to be placed in Ray s cornfield In time the eight convicted White Sox have been wished out of the cornfield and are playing baseball in the field Then another message comes and Ray finds himself on a mysterious mission to Boston to find controversial 1960s writer Terence Mann supremely played by James Earl Jones Jones s performance is quirky and brilliant Mann s first meeting with Ray is worth the ticket price all by itself Ray continues his ridiculous set of tasks and quests until at the end it all comes together and makes sense Faults Well over the rest of the story there is superimposed a rather prosaic save the farm plot that gets into the way of some of the better story telling Then toward the end of the film there is a rather gratuitous piece of cheap suspense It is needed for the larger plot almost every shot in this film is but the actual cause of the suspense seems forced Universal has taken a chance on an intelligent fantasy film with a complex script and has made one of the best films of the year I would give it a low 3 on the 4 to 4 scale Pity it was about baseball
0537,Field of Dreams,1989,Summary The Best Film of the Year so far No I m not a baseball fan and yes maybe this film is a bit too Utopian for some of you That s your problem There is no film I ve seen this year that I ve enjoyed more than FIELD OF DREAMS it combines an absolute sterling story and script with excellent performances and I enjoyed the living daylights out of it First the story and don t worry I d feel criminal if I gave anything away All I ll say is that it s about a novice farmer in Iowa who hears voices in his cornfield and it weaves heaven nature and baseball in and out of one of the most graceful plot designs I ve seen placed on the screen I can tell you what it has in it though It s got a basic plot that twirls around on about 6 different axes each independent but linked to the others each beautiful in its own right each culminating in a resolution actually the same resolution and each catching me completely off guard when it touched down It has characters who get their personalities across in about three minutes aided by some very skillful actors I found them uncommonly easy to laugh with and impossible to forget It contains some of the most beautiful images I can remember looked for in a place few others would give a second glance to And it has more imagination and creativity than any fifteen films out there today The actors uniformly absorb the spirit of their characters and literally radiate them out I kept wondering if Costner s role in BULL DURHAM would slide over to FIELD OF DREAMS on my part or on his It doesn t he is a character the others react to and when he finally has the spotlight well it s a fine thing to see a fine thing Amy Madigan has never been better she juices her role into three dimensionality in about thirty seconds A delight James Earl Jones is absolutely a pleasure to watch his unrolling of his character from the tight cynical ball it arrives in was a pleasure in itself The players are all good especially Ray Liota as Shoeless Joe certainly a change in roles for him and Burt Lancaster is himself which should be enough Only the guy from thirty something seemed stuck in a rather deadpan manner as the heavy but that s really having to scratch at the dirt for criticisms This is a picture of dreams of images of men fading into the shadowed green of a cornfield and of white spheres fading into the dusk beyond the lights It s romantic and hopeful and it believes in magic and family and baseball And probably Mom I don t know about apple pie but I ll give it the benefit of the doubt
0538,Dream Team The,1989,This is one of those unusual films where every member of the cast and creative team have a high point at one time or another during the film Unfortunately their zeniths never peak at the same time and you re left with a film that is excruciatingly close to being over the thumbs up line but which never quite makes it The story covers a group of four mental patients Michael Keaton Peter Boyle Christopher Lloyd and Stephen Furst who are taken on a day trip to New York City by their doctor Unfortunately the doctor witnesses a murder and is assaulted and his patients are blamed for the attack They re left to their own devices which is the point of the film I like the concept of the writer adding a bit of drama to the comedy letting the audience see a few of the struggles these people are having to make to deal with sanity I just wish it could have done better Lloyd s reunion with his family comes particularly close but again it never crosses the line As for the rest of the script the writer has given several of the characters some very funny dialogue but it only comes in spurts and at the oddest times And it s unevenly distributed going mostly to Keaton and sporadically to Boyle Lloyd is left with a character who is supposed to be annoying and funny and ends up only being annoying Note to anyone who sees this movie or has seen it and who has a better memory than me not much of a feat could you please drop me a line with the exchange between Peter Boyle s character and Keaton s girlfriend s yuppie room mate about the sculpture Beautiful line Also any good lines Keaton had that you can remember As to the actors there s some very good work here Lloyd as I ve said comes very close to making his unsympathetic character sympathetic but he just doesn t have the script to do it with Boyle is OK but has some great lines Furst is Furst The fellow who plays their doctor was excellent one of those small roles where the actor fits the role so perfectly that you keep pointing it out later Keaton however is the star and he certainly carries things whenever he s given the opportunity True he has the best lines but he always takes them as far as he can The man has an intensity that makes for a very believable violent psychopath what you like about him is that he seems to get angry with all the right people Which I guess is a definition of his role in BATMAN I still don t know if he can pull off his role in that film I keep wondering if he might have made a better Joker At any rate he is the only actor I know of who should be allowed to play Jack Nicholson I can t really recommend THE DREAM TEAM but I have to give it a B for effort Better luck next times guys
0539,Scandal,1989,Capsule review Fine engrossing docu drama about the Profumo affair that toppled the British government in 1963 Many fine ironies in the script Is it redundant to say that John Hurt turns in a good performance Rating 2 Dr Stephen Ward is the son of a vicar and a successful osteopath His hobby is hobnobbing with the real newsmakers in the upper circles of the British and some foreign governments One way he does this is that he finds young women who have natural beauty and develops them like a one man finishing school giving them some class and making them the kind of women men in government like to be around Just having these women around makes Ward popular with his inner circle When a friend in MI5 the British equivalent of our FBI gets interested in Ward s activities along these lines it begins a chain of events that will eventually topple the British Conservative government SCANDAL is the engrossing story of Stephen Ward and the entire Profumo affair The story tells how Ward beautifully and slightly seedily played by John Hurt finds Christine Keeler played by Joanne Whalley Kilmer as a somewhat cheap looking in a girlie show Like Pygmalion or perhaps Svengali he shows her a bit of the rich life and begins tutoring her and friend Mandy Rice Davies on how to get it you have to be very clever or very beautiful As the film portrays him Ward has a passion for beauty and wants to be intimately but totally platonically involved in the lives of the women he has transformed His interest is not sex but helping his babies get what they want and at the same time Ward wants the feeling that like James Bond he is a man with power This power like the gratitude of the women he has transformed he firmly refuses to exploit for any tangible advantage His biggest payoff is the irony that the woman he trained has managed to have simultaneous affairs with the British Secretary of State for War John Profumo and Soviet military attache Eugene Ivanov But just as Ward is seduced by a feeling of importance Christine is also when the newspapers learn of the scandal two years later And only when the government desperately needs a scapegoat does Ward realize how vulnerable he has left himself SCANDAL seems very much the British equivalent of the American STAR 80 While that film s Paul Snider does not have Dr Ward s unselfish goals both men are puppet masters who instinctively know how to make women attractive and how to make them stars Both films depend very heavily on erotic photography independent of their narrative values Both films tell of Svengali destroyed by overreaching himself The film is sprinkled with familiar actors Joanne Whalley Kilmer was previously the nurse in THE SINGING DETECTIVE Ian McKellan plays the nervous Profumo with appropriate style considering he has the strangest looking hairdo of the pre punk era We see little of Deborah Grant as Mrs Profumo but a side note of interest is that the real Mrs Profumo was Valerie Hobson who played the title role in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN Think about it before you try to correct me SCANDAL punctuates its story as so many films about the recent past do with a broad choice of music of the period But no piece of music is better used than Listen Do You Want to Know a Secret superimposed over a montage of scandal laden newspaper headlines This is one more entry in a run of good recent films I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0540,Dangerous Liaisons,1988,I guess I look at it this way you can stuff Close and Malkovich into the dress of the nobility place them in lavish sets though surprisingly fairly pedestrian photography and give them tons of room to emote in I didn t see FATAL ATTRACTION but I bet it was a lot like Close s next to final scene where she starts ripping up her dressing room however without a lot of quality acid dialogue there isn t a lot that separates DANGEROUS LIAISONS from DYNASTY This became evident pretty quickly into the picture The plot is complex enough to be interesting but since it all comes down to who is diddling who it resulted in a plot that was only marginally more interesting than a study of Paddington Station train schedules What I really started to look for and what I never found was some witty pointed dialogue that would supplement a group of characters I had no interest in following for two hours Nada I damn near fell asleep a couple of times Malkovich rarely seems to show emotion and his final agony isn t very believable to me Close is fun to watch and she really can add some interest to the picture through her ability to look coy in 791 different ways but it certainly isn t enough to save the ship The others left next to no impression on me except that the young man who duels with Malkovich played Ted in BILL AND TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE I fervently wish those two had shown up somewhere in this film
0542,See No Evil Hear No Evil,1989,I m slowly reaching a point of total desperation I mean when the most memorable film I ve seen all year is BILL TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE I know something s not right with the movies I m seeing I was taken in for a while by DANGEROUS LIAISONS glossy production but Moriarity was right It would have been much more interesting if Bill had been in there along with Ted In such a state one has nothing to lose by taking chances So when I heard of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder together again in a new comedy SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL I said to myself Why not I ve been a fan of Pryor s ever since I had the enforced opportunity while sweating in a barracks bay in the middle of Texas during 1974 of virtually memorizing every word of Pryor s album THAT NIGGER S CRAZY I m quoting Pryor Right Got that Let me say it again in case you didn t see it the first time I M QUOTING PRYOR while other members of my platoon played it several times a night for a period of months Actually except for the monotony I didn t mind Pryor s skewering of hopelessly square white people was not without justice and was balanced by a no less unjust and much more brutal skewering of his brethren but I digress In SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL Pryor plays Wally an excitable blind man who becomes extricated with Dave a cranky deaf man played by of course Gene Wilder Through a series of coincidences the two are implicated in a murder and must cooperate to clear themselves and bring the real killers to justice Now anybody who has ever studied the least amount of statistics which roughly describes the level of my knowledge on that score knows that the distribution of almost anything follows what is called a normal curve there s a few things on the low end there s a few things on the high end and there s a big bulge in the middle This movie falls clearly into the bulge What can I say about a movie that I can t have the pleasure of getting excited about or the satisfaction of taking an axe to There s only one conclusion A short movie review To be sure SEE NO EVIL has its fine moments a lunatic fistfight scene is good for some very big laughs but there are slow moments as well a most improbable impersonation tries to be funny but merely seems stupid Pryor occasionally reaches a pitch of lunacy but while his foul mouth which actually seems a little tame since we ve all gotten used to Eddie Murphy is sometimes good for a laugh at other times it seems well foul The plot is a thrown together contraption that adds no interest to the movie I think they must have a computer program that generates such plots Probably runs on an old Timex Sinclair ZX 80 In summary what can I say about this movie The HITCH HIKER S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY had the right description in a single word HARMLESS
0543,Earth Girls Are Easy,1989,Capsule review Helium weight comedy has a typical Valley Girl played by Geena Davis meeting a bright blue furry alien played by Jeff Goldblum looking like a flea market bathmat EARTH GIRLS is based on the Julie Brown song of the same title Director Julien Temple also directed ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS and it was much better Rating high 0 It all started when witty and moderately attractive Julie Brown nearly made it to being chosen homecoming queen As she tells it rather than just being disappointed she struck back by writing songs making fun of all the institutions her friends enjoyed Her songs now a popular staple of the Dr Demento show include Everybody Run the Homecoming Queen s Got a Gun Cause I m a Blond and Earth Girls Are Easy The last was done in a Valley Girl accent as an air head describes a close encounter of a fourth kind with non humanoid aliens When the song was sold to be made as a film Brown rephrased it to delete the non humanoid references She also co wrote the script and plays a prominent role in the film EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY hides the fact that it is really a British production directed by Julian Temple Temple directed the kinetically stunning ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS which unfortunately never found its market and which died at the boxoffice EARTH GIRLS is a much less ambitious film but it probably is light and mindless enough to make the profit the other film missed EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY opens with a sort of pop art spaceship in a pop art space scene Inside are three shaggy aliens each one of the primary colors red yellow and blue and each looking for female companionship Loneliest of all is Mac played by Jeff Goldblum who is not just merely blue he s really most sincerely blue But our three aliens strike it lucky they pick up a television broadcast from Earth and discover that this planet has girls Meanwhile one such girl is Valerie played by Geena Davis a mere decade too old for the role Valerie the Valley Girl air head of the song is engaged to Ted played by can you believe it Charles Rocket a doctor who cannot resist playing doctor whenever he is given the opportunity Julie catches Ted about to play Dr Love with a nurse and she throws him out of his own house Sorry this next part has to be done in Valley Girl accent Well like she s feeling all bummed out the next day ya know and like sitting next to Ted s pool soaking up sun when like wow this totally tubular spaceship falls out of the sky and like ya know splashes down right there in the pool Awesome She should know she can t make it with Mac because he s like blue ya know and all covered with hair And like they re from two different worlds But then hey this is science fiction Okay that s enough of that Temple s view of Americans is not very perceptive His production numbers look like they are borrowed from GREASE and from 1960s beach blanket movies He does have one very nice dream sequence an homage to the props of better known science fiction films but that is as close as EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY ever gets to art If there is an idea to this sci fi in the worst sense film Temple has made clear that it is an unwelcome guest and has sentenced it to solitary confinement I rate this cotton candy film a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale Like wow
0544,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,1989,Before getting into Review Mode I should disclaim a bit I haven t been crazy about previous Indiana Jones movies I liked RAIDERS particularly the first 15 minutes but it always seemed like a one joke concept take all those old serial cliffhangers and one up them Stylishly done but after coming out of the theater I had no great wish to pay 4 50 those were the days to get back in again TEMPLE OF DOOM on the other hand was a film I wished I d never gotten into in the first place The film had a thin brittle edge that made the whole thing impersonal it was as if Spielburg was so out of breath doing his rollercoaster bit that he never gave the audience the opportunity to treat the characters as more than cardboard cut outs I walked out of TEMPLE feeling gyped and a bit wary of future Spielburg Lucas collaborations With this out of the way let me give a whole hearted thumbs up to INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE The film opens up with a flashback of Indy as a young man River Phoenix and goes from their into the setup of the whole film the Holy Grail is near to being found again and Indy s father has disappeared on the quest Indy accompanied by Marcus Denholm Elliot and eventually Sallah John Rhys Davies accompany Indy on his search for both relic and father Yes there are a ton of stunts yes there are loads of visual humor yes there is a female romantic interest and yes there are Nazis It is always convenient to have villains whom you can have no qualms about seeing shot blown up or run over by large man made objects the Gestapo are particularly appropriate for this So what makes this different than previous Indy films Well the first part is still a bit too frantic even the Phoenix bit a lot of plot is tossed off and a lot of stunts done It almost reaches RAIDERS during this time and then in a sudden flash it surpasses it I can tell you exactly when too the introduction of Dr Henry Jones Sean Connery Several things happen immediately after Connery makes his entrance One the script improves and improves and improves Witty dialogue and an actual story with a few moralistic messages which go down pretty easily at least more easily than in THE 10 COMMANDMENTS Secondly the actors do more with the dialogue Connery plays each of his lines for all their worth but what s more he and Ford seem to bounce their performances off one another making a funny line twice as funny due to the chemistry that the two set up And believe me this is great casting Harrison Ford and Sean Connery do a father son routine that several recent comedies dealing with filial relations would envy The rest of the film is a breeze you just sit back and let it carry you P S See it with a large audience this is a definite crowd pleaser One of my major complaints with RAIDERS has always been that the best puzzle stunt scene is the opening in LAST CRUSADE Spielburg has the sense to put his puzzle at the end and to make it a good one Rhys Davies is never given much of chance to perform Elliot plays alarmingly close to a dithering idiot I seem to remember him as a somewhat tougher character in RAIDERS Alison Doody my God woman people change their names in Hollywood all the time does what she can with her role and for some reason Julian Glover is given an American accent when he does a wonderful British one But Marcus and Sallah aren t made to feel like baggage and if they aren t exactly given the chance to entertain their presence is a comfort as second banannas if nothing else In summary it s worth the 6 I paid to see it and I think you ll enjoy it even if you weren t that much of a RAIDERS fan
0545,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,1989,It is no real secret The Hollywood wonder boy of twelve summers ago and much of the time since George Lucas is hurting for money Things have not really panned out for him HOWARD THE DUCK which featured the greatest technological duck special effects the screen has ever seen laid an egg And it was NOT a golden egg That was only one of several projects that have enhanced neither Lucas s fortune nor his reputation Lucas needs a hit That much seems to be fact My opinion is that Lucas knows how to have a pit if all he wants is a hit rather than trying something new and original He just makes another one of his series films It takes too long to do a STAR WARS film so he did another Indiana Jones film instead The one drawback is INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM was a disappointment and done much more in the Spielberg style than in the style Lucas put into RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Spielberg directs all the Indy films of course but I suspect some of the exaggerated cartoonish feel of the second film was Spielberg s And many of the fans preferred the style of the first film All Lucas really needed for a hit was to do again what he did with RAIDERS And he did The style of the first film is back Welcome back INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE semi fulfills Lucas s unrealistic promise that each episode would be a prequel to the one made before it Harrison Ford is not getting younger So of the three films this takes place the latest but there is an extended flashback in which we learn a lot of H how Indiana Jones became Indiana Jones The young Indy is played by River Phoenix who almost resembles a young Harrison Ford and in fact played Ford s son in MOSQUITO COAST In Indy s early adventure we see where he got a lot of what he becomes and even what he wears When he gets older we also get introduced to his father voiced and in later scenes played by Sean Connery Indy is once again after a Biblical treasure Earlier it was the greatest prize of the Old Testament the Ark of the Covenant This time it is the greatest prize of the New testament the Holy Grail Do you remember what you liked about the first film If you said Karen Allen you are out of luck This time Indy s female sidekick is Elsa Schneider played by Alison Doody the most attractive of the traveling companions of the three films but also the one with the least real personality That means in this aspect as in most aspects this is better than the second Indy film but not up to the original If you said you liked just about anything else about the original the gritty chases the fights the baroque Nazi military equipment the ancient sites that are gamuts of booby traps the snakes whatever you are in luck It is all back and more You also get Indy s love hate relationship with his father You get to see more of Sallah and Marcus Brody played by John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliot respectively One disappointment is that they did a Nigel Bruce on Denholm Elliot s character i e they turned a perfectly serious and interesting character into a buffoon But for almost any reason that you liked the first Indy film you will also like the third On the 4 to 4 scale I give RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK a 3 INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM a flat 0 and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE a high 2 missing a 3 only for its lack of originality
0546,Pink Cadillac,1989,Like them or not the one thing you have to admire about an Indiana Jones movie is that much great care and effort goes into them But it s hard to say much more since by my lights there isn t any good reason to write reviews about them Those of us who play at being reviewers as well as I suspect those who do it for a living must occasionally ask ourselves Why am I doing this Obviously different people have different reasons The good Mr Leeper and Mr Meyer seem to have rationales somewhat unlike my own they are very analytical and take their efforts seriously I am not being sarcastic I m always like this and I concede without hesitation or embarrassment to the true enthusiasts as opposed to the mere dabbler such as myself Besides I LIKE reading their reviews So why write reviews Myself I look at it as something like Consumer Reports Can I give the reader some recommendation as to how to spend his or her hard earned money and precious time Nobody has limitless money or time and except for the true enthusiasts see above few are inclined to see almost every movie that comes out In this way I get the opportunity to help those moviemakers who have blessedly enlivened my dull life as well as punish those who have ripped me off Besides it s fun such is vanity To this end I try to give you gentle reader some idea of what the movie is about the level of effort that went into its production the target audience and if I dare some indication of my personal inclinations toward it With the full knowledge that this is not only highly subjective but invariably modified by such factors as the time of day the weather and my somewhat variable physical well being Given this there s absolutely no reason for me to review INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE All of you know what an Indiana Jones movie is like if you like that sort of thing you ll go see it no matter what anyone says if you don t a team of Clydesdales won t be able to drag you there As far as my own opinion goes I sat through it enjoyably and forgot about it the instant the door slammed behind me However I had the same reaction to the previous two with the modification that TEMPLE OF DOOM also gave me at least the illusion of bruises abrasions lacerations and an ever so slight concussion But I d gone all primed to write a review and there I was my motor spinning with nothing to take up the slack So the next day I went and saw Clint Eastwood and Bernadette Peters in PINK CADILLAC In this film Clint plays Tom Nowak a highly professional skip tracer a sort of bounty hunter who works for a bail bond agent to trace those who have skipped on their bail He s good at his work but otherwise not a highly motivated guy Doesn t want to take things very seriously doesn t want to get involved Cut to a trailer park where LuAnn McGuire Bernadette Peters finds herself with an 8 month old baby and a worthless husband who has become involved with a Sunday soldier fascist racist gang of ex cons known as Birthright Their current scam is passing bogus currency Don t worry this is idiot proof her husband says The next thing LuAnn knows is that she s standing in front of the judge taking the rap Enough is enough she figures so she posts bond grabs her baby hops in her husband s big pink Cadillac with the turbojet tailfins and jumps the state Now the plot directions from this point become obvious although I should add that there was something important in the caddy when LuAnn took off and I need say nothing more on this score Saying more about a Clint Eastwood flic poses similar problems to those posed by an Indiana Jones flic If you like Clint you go see his movies if you don t you won t I count myself among the faithful though nowhere near to the level of the family friend who named his son Clint in Eastwood s honor And it s a little like buying a Big Mac you know you re not going to get something really bad or very good you can expect and will get a more or less consistent competent mediocre product Truly I have no superlatives for this film There is nothing in it that seems particularly exciting the acting is nothing special the story is nothing special and there isn t a lot of tension because despite their nastiness the bad guys seem more stupid and comical than really dangerous and have no doubt attended the Imperial Storm Trooper School of Marksmanship since they can t hit the broad side of a protagonist with an assault weapon set to rock and roll But that didn t really matter because the I found the whole effect pleasing The story may be mechanical but clicks along nicely and Peters and Eastwood achieve a good chemistry please nobody tell me what the difference is in their ages I don t want to know I very much enjoyed Peters a young woman who I could not describe as beautiful or even pretty but who nonetheless possesses a proverbial smoldering sexuality with her cupid pout and her live wire little lost girl personality Another thing I have to say about this film is that it is clearly a blue collar film for a blue collar market blue jeans and beer pick up trucks and bars I like this myself since although I couldn t kid myself to say that I fit into that scene my family runs a construction company and that is the landscape within which I was raised to which I occasionally return and which I deeply respect But thinking about it I know the real reason I enjoyed this movie Been hanging around with programmers too much And can I recommend this film I guess if you like Clint and can relate to shit kickers you might find this a good time Thanks to Linh Tu for this remark Too good to pass up
0548,Crossing Delancey,1988,Well I was looking forward to seeing CROSSING DELANCEY since everyone I know who saw it said they d liked it Supposedly it was about how one falls in love despite rather than because of how you think it ought to be Well that s what MOONSTRUCK was about or at least what one of Nicholas Cage s speeches in MOONSTRUCK was about and a good little speech it was too But CROSSING DELANCEY was not really about that at all It was really about how deep down inside every fish knows they really need a bicycle Okay so here I am expecting to like this film and it starts out with Amy Irving s character Izzy hmmm a unisex name in her exciting New York singles life with her literary crowd and her occasional overnight lay with this old Jewish grandmother whom she loves but who doesn t really understand who she is And Bubba Yiddish affectionate term for grandma arranges for Izzy to meet this nice Jewish man who sells pickles Hmmm pickles I already know the plot She s going to end up with the pickle man so what I want to see is how the film will pull it off All the film has to do now is to get me to like this pickle guy and consider him superior to the literary types she hangs with Well there are already things about the lit folks not to like The usual faults vanity pretentiousness manipulativeness superficiality They just know how to phrase things in an interesting manner So we re halfway there And we ve got to overcome outdatedness religiousness which is after all outdated drabness uncoolness on Sam the pickle man s side He has to become substance in contrast to the other folks style Well his drabness can be shown to be self assurance i e he has no need to dramatize himself His outdatedness can actually be respect for those outdated others in his community e g he allows the matchmaker to believe that it was she who brought them together when actually he d noticed Izzy two years earlier His straight forwardness is contrasted to the manipulations of the lit crowd and Izzy herself in her embodyment of their values But for me any way I never experience Sam as attractive If only he would let slip that he could phrase things in an interesting manner too if he felt like it In the Italian version Nicholas Cage s character has an outrageousness and an energy which is attractive but Sam is just too G rated to be exciting without some unique characteristic to make him stand out But that s part of the message of this film Bubba admits the man she d married wasn t special just persistent but that showed how much he loved her and that that was the basis of her marriage s and therefore all marriage s success Attractiveness is just style persistence is substance And what does Sam see in Izzy His first attraction is to her looks And all that he gets to see of her in the following several scenes is how good she looks and how badly she treats him So Sam gets to chase style and ignore substance Well he s got enough substance for both of them So I m left feeling that since her life is incomplete without a man and we are continuously and subtly shown evidence that this is so only she s too modern to admit it to herself and Sam is a nice man since he puts up with her mistreatment of him she is right to end up with him She doesn t understand why she is attracted to him and acts as if she is drawn to him against her will I don t understand why she is attracted to him either and experienced the against her will part not as a surrender to a deeper self within her but as a surrender to the traditional solution for what every women really needs
0549,Hol volt hol nem volt,1987,A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE harkens back to those halcyon days of foreign film intellectualism the 1960 s when no self respecting intellectual would be found without an opinion on the latest Godard film or a preference for either Fellini or Bergman Those were the days of really foreign foreign films films which challenged the intellect and amazed the eye They also had a certain heaviness sometimes to the point of indigestibility At their best they were bold and challenging At their worst they were dull and pretentious A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE is reminiscent of that sort of film but unfortunately not in the best sense It s obscure but not very deep It has the requisite level of difficulty and heaviness for a 60 s European film but it isn t very satisfying Director Gyula Gazdag has taken an interesting premise started out on a cinematic journey but then taken a dive into shallow but murky intellectual waters The resulting film has some fine moments but fails to move or provoke The premise of the film derives from a Gilbert and Sullivan style Hungarian law still on the books All Hungarian children must have an official father If no father is known one is created Thus some illegitimate children have fictional fathers with fictional addresses and occupations on their birth certificates Gazdag looks at such a child and examines what might happen if he suddenly lost his mother before discovering that his supposed father doesn t exist at all In some senses this is a terrific premise I can easily imagine a fine comedy or suspense film taking its starting point from here Taking the film in one of these directions would not lead to much depth but could be fun On the other hand this premise could equally well serve as a jumping off point into a serious examination of the nature of reality or into totalitarian suppression of truth or into the roles of fathers and sons Or one can imagine a realistic social drama of a child on his own in a difficult society At first this latter appears to be what Gazdag is up to But the continued intercutting of the boy s plight with the activities of the clerk who originally invented his father indicates that something more is going on This clerk suddenly decides to destroy all of the records of children who he has supplied fictitious fathers to We see a bit of the boy s story told in a fairly realistic manner then some rather odd behavior from the clerk then we re back to the boy Eventually the stories come together and the movie comes apart Gazdag suddenly breaks into surrealistic symbolism and confusing fantasy Perhaps all of this symbolism and oddity makes sense to Hungarians It made little sense to me Its only value seemed to be unpredicatability Surprises and twists are all well and good but they work best when in retrospect they make sense Those in A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE do not They seem arbitrary suggesting a writer who didn t know how to end his script In many ways A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE goes downhill The opening sequence features excellent photography both technically and artistically The last shot is a standardly composed poorly executed special effect The story telling is initially unusually elliptical yet logical By the end the method has become quite conventional while at the same time displaying no logic worth mentioning The use of music from Mozart s THE MAGIC FLUTE early in the film is much more effective than its overuse at the end of the film One element that remains strong throughout the film is the performance by David Vermes as the boy Vermes had never been in a film before but he delivers a strong performance As other writers have mentioned he looks remarkably like a young blond Marlon Brando and he has some of the intensity of Brando as well The other performances in the film are capable One point in the film s favor for me at least is that it is in black and white Black and white photography can achieve some remarkable effects and has a mood all its own that even the best color photography cannot duplicate A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE has very fine photography especially in the early part of the film Cinematographer Elemer Ragalyi composes and lights shots beautifully Unfortunately by the end of the film his creativity was either exhausted or suppressed Gazdag has said as have many other directors that his films should speak for themselves A HUNGARIAN FAIRY TALE mumbles or perhaps speaks only Hungarian In its more coherent moments it has great beauty Its decline into incomprehensibility is thus all the more regrettable
0550,Dead Poets Society,1989,Capsule review Robin Williams plays an unorthodox and charismatic teacher branded as dangerous in what is basically a retelling of THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE told sympathetically to the teacher Fundamentally good but it has some problems with its narrative style Rating high 1 There are lots and lots of films about schools but very few films really about the teaching process and the influence of a teacher on students Perhaps the best is Ronald Neame s 1969 film THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE which managed to tighten up the narrative of the Muriel Spark novel one of the rare occasions a film adaptation improves greatly on the novel incidentally Neame s film tells the story of a teacher who broadens her students world but at the same time molds them into her own likeness Having myself been greatly influenced by a very charismatic high school teacher who I think greatly affected my world view I find THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE hits very close to home for me though because I liked this teacher a lot I sometimes try also to see the film from a point of view sympathetic to Miss Brodie What does the story become then It becomes something very much like Peter Weir s new film DEAD POETS SOCIETY The year is 1959 The setting is Welton Academy a very posh and expensive prep school dedicated to bleaching any sort of non conformity out of its students and programming them to be successful if unimaginative social leaders The new English teacher is one John Keating played with as much control and and reserve as Robin Williams could possibly put into a performance But even Williams s most reserved character could never fit in as a teacher at a place like Welton His Keating uses unorthodox efforts to get his students to feel the emotion of the they read and he gets them to live lives that will allow them to feel their own emotions and the emotions of the great poets Keating s class is a good show but we know from the beginning it is a show that will not outlast the season As in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM which had a very similar story line we admire the non conformist but we know he will not be around for long DEAD POETS SOCIETY is his story and the story of his students while he is there In particular it is the story of a group of friends who form the Dead Poets Society and sneak out to the woods after hours in order to read poetry and discuss life And it is in the film s depiction of these meetings that Weir s film lets us down the most We hear a little poetry and we see the lives changing but the connection between the two is never clearly drawn What poems are influential and why a very major question of the film is never really explained We never really see why the meetings transcend being bull sessions that have occasional poetry readings The real value of these meetings so central to the film is never clear Similarly we are told one of the members has written a very controversial article for the school newspaper but we are given only the vaguest idea of what the article said And because the exact influence the teacher and the poetry has had on the students is left as vague as it is when the film starts following the lives of the students outside of school hours it rapidly loses interest for me I found myself not really caring whether one of the students would or would not work up the courage to kiss his current heartthrob I found myself just looking at the nice misty snowy photography and waiting for something of interest to happen Another problem with the script is that while Keating is clearly played for sympathy he is not entirely such an ideal teacher Early on he has his students cut an article on poetry analysis out of their textbooks and destroy it before they had read more than the first paragraph And the enthusiasm that he can get from his students for this sort of an action reinforces his similarities to the dangerous Miss Brodie and other dictators in history who have been more dangerous One final complaint in 1959 the sort of regimentation that the film complains about may have been a problem If anything this country s schools have the opposite problem of insufficient discipline today Weir is preaching to the choir This review has concentrated mostly on the negative aspects of a basically good film Enough reviewers will be telling about the film s good points I was concerned that these flaws might be less likely to be mentioned In a field of films about drugs car chases and plastic monsters DEAD POETS SOCIETY is a good choice albeit flawed I rate it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0551,Cousins,1989,Well I just saw the best film I ve seen in a LONG time and since I ve not seen it mentioned here I ll pass on my impressions I m giving it a good solid 3 on the 4 to 4 scale The name of this marvel is COUSINS and I wish I had seen it when it first came out so I could have gone back tonight instead of seeing it for the first time The key word to describe this movie is pure In the first place it s a pure romance it even has a happy ending which works The characters are also pure in the sense of being archetypes First we have our hero a pure romantic whose father says he failed at everything except life The horrendous miscasting that gave this role to Ted Danson is the only factor that keeps this from being a 4 movie I liked CHEERS and I can even tolerate some of his other movies but a romantic lead in a role that requires a modicum of sensitivity and depth not a chance Next comes the leading lady magnificently played by Isabelle Rossallini who almost makes up for Danson She is a pure good woman who is ready to abandon her own happiness because her husband and daughter need her Inside her is another pure romantic trying to get out Married to them are Sean Young playing a purely vapid career girl who doesn t have a clue what she wants out of life and William Petersen the purest ssh le it s been my pleasure to watch in as long as I can remember Got a problem Use your fists And last but not by a damn sight least is Lloyd Bridges playing the most delightfully pure dirty old man I have ever seen Would your grandfather share his porno magazines with you It s the screenplay though that makes this movie a pure delight It s a purely brilliant adaptation of COUSIN COUSINE almost a pure translation A very witty story of two people whose spouses are having an affair and begin seeing each other purely as friends for consolation and a certain amount of revenge and end up almost against their wills actually falling in love Mix these ingredients with direction that s adequate with occasional flashes of brilliance and camera work that includes some truly awesome Canadian scenery and you get a movie that s bound to appeal to the pure romantic in you Take him or her to see it
0552,Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1989,Okay what can I say I have heard a lot negative about STAR TREK V Maybe my expectations were lower for this film than for others in the series And there is a lot that is wrong with STAR TREK V There is a lot that it does not deliver that others in the series did The special effects which are rumored not to have been done by Industrial Light and Magic because Shatner s and Nimoy s salaries are not as perfect as in the other films Well fine The effects are not jarringly bad and did not get in the way of the story There are a lot of silly and even stupid scenes There is a rescue at the beginning like something out of SUPERMAN that irritated me If you have seen the coming attractions you have seen Jimmy Doohan doing a silly pratfall There are serious style problems This is not going to be one of the more popular Star Trek movies But when it is all over STAR TREK V has said something about the nature of religious inspiration and the need to question it It did not use its science fiction merely to give us an interesting backdrop for a swashbuckler STAR TREK V is more subversive than LIFE OF BRIAN and I suspect move subversive than THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST I say I suspect because I have not had an opportunity to see THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST It seems somebody thought the ideas in it were too dangerous Luckily there are some relatively safe havens for free thought and science fiction is one of them On a remote desert planet a messianic figure a Vulcan named Sybok comes out of the wilderness with a religious mission a mission that requires a starship It is not difficult to guess what starship he is going to get His plan though convoluted is perfectly logical Meanwhile we are treated to some very sappy scenes of the Enterprise s merry men on shore leave at Yosemite National Park These would have been well left on the cutting room floor Rest assured the plot will soon have Klingons ship capturings a mission to where no anything has gone before There is a lot in this film that the filmmakers will have a hard time living down Nichelle Nichols who by now looks like a grandmother attempts an absurd erotic dance against what looks like an astronomically impossible backdrop There are slapstick scenes in elevator shafts There is a sort of encounter group session in space that is pitifully cliched There is bad camerawork at times Then there is the puzzling question of David Warner s role It was too big to be a cameo and too small to be considered a major part An actor of his stature is unlikely to have signed up for such a small role so one wonders if there was more that was cut And the music is entirely retreaded from previous films For much of the film I was seriously disliking it But when it was all over I liked what it seemed to me the film had said It did for me what I want science fiction to do for me So I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale SPOILERS FOLLOW I am certain I will be asked by someone what I consider to be the subversive message of STAR TREK V If I have to put it in a few sentences it would be this Religious inspiration is not to be trusted You can feel what you think is the light of your god filling your life and it can be a delusion It is possible that all religious fervor is self delusion that feels good but has not one iota of truth You cannot trust your feelings however powerful they are God if He exists must be amenable to logic You have the right and the responsibility to question politely what seems to be the word of God If it does not make sense to you you have the responsibility to deny it Certainly the god in STAR TREK V is a false god and the believers in this god are wrong but who has more reason to believe in their own god than the believers in the film What makes it more reason What is sufficient reason The film is ultimately saying that reason is more important than faith
0553,Split,1989,Synopsis In the near future society is controlled by a totalitarian police force that relies heavily on computers A loner armed with a doomsday weapon dares to fight the system and preach the heresy of individualism A fast paced science fiction film filled with computer graphics Director Screenplay Chris Shaw Principal cast Tim Dwight Joan Bechtel John Flynn Chris Shaw Special Effects Robert Shaw Peter Broadwell This is the first film by Chris Shaw a mathematician embarking on a new career as a film maker Shaw is best known for writing textbooks his works include Dynamics The Geometry of Behavior However his debut as a Director is impressive for the film is very fast paced filled with computer graphics The film is set in the near future where society is controlled by a totalitarian police force which uses computers to track and control the population A weirdo named Starker who stands out because there is no file on him in the huge police database is pursued by the police It turns out that Starker is a very dangerous man to the system In fact he is carrying the weapon that can defeat the system a plastic case filled with genetically engineered bacteria that infect people with the disease from the system s viewpoint of individualism Once people become individuals they are useless to the system for they cannot be controlled The bacteria also have a side effect which gives the film some of its most interesting scenes they produce bizarre warped hallucinations in infected persons The police forces are lead by a man played by Director Chris Shaw who progressively changes from human to machine as the movie develops Piece by piece they replace his human parts with robotics until he becomes a machine On an intellectual level the film deals with the split between individualism and conformity to society and personal freedom versus totalitarianism The repressive future world shown in the film looks very much like the present it was filmed here in San Francisco and Santa Cruz and this raises a number of interesting questions The intellectual issues raised here are worth pondering our society is filled with social activists who want us to trade our freedom for their visions of a better world I was very pleased that the film is on the side of individualism and personal freedom There is a lot to like about the film plenty of action interesting story and interesting special effects mostly computer graphics However it does have some flaws Some of the outdoor photography is rather poor and grainy Although the story is interesting it is hard to follow at times Some of the transitions from scene to scene are not so smooth The special effects are interesting and are a major part of the film However the film had a budget of only 300 000 which is tiny compared to the millions spent on films like the latest STAR TREK If you care more about special effects than plot or if you require that the special effects be the best i e comparable to those in say STAR TREK IV THE VOYAGE HOME or ALIENS then you should not see this film Despite this caveat the effects are nice for example in the opening and closing credits the names listed dissolve into points and sweep away in a star field type of effect Overall evaluation good despite its low budget and technical flaws Recommended for its interesting story Special effects fanatics may want to skip it perhaps they should watch the big budget summer sequels instead
0554,Miracle Mile,1989,I liked MIRACLE MILE even though the concept of the movie isn t particularly original The main character Harry Washello has just met the woman of his dreams while wandering through a museum at the LaBrea Tar Pits He s a trumpet player a self professed Glen Miller wannabee who looks sort of sweet and honest like John Boy from the Waltons Julie s a waitress an old fashioned girl who lives with her grandmother she also promises to screw his eyeballs blue on their first date Fine So they have the hots for each other Big deal you say Their hot date doesn t go as planned Harry inadvertently answers a phone call meant for someone else The caller is a young soldier stationed in a missile silo in North Dakota He had meant to call his father to say goodbye You see The BOMB is coming Harry is stunned He can t be sure if the phone call was real or if it was a prank I couldn t tell either Throughout the movie I kept changing my mind as the situations became more frantic Oh s t it s real Sigh it s not real etc Now that I have had some time to mull over it I d say that the suspense is reminiscent of AFTER HOURS The movie did raise some questions What if an ordinary person someone I d trust tells me that the BOMBS are flying now and that I have 50 minutes til I m vaporized Would I be more likely to believe it if I heard it from a clean cut man in a suit as opposed to a disheveled homeless person And if the BOMB really is coming what should a responsible adult do Will I regret not doing the things I really want to do but never had the time for MIRACLE MILE doesn t have the clinical horror of THE WAR GAME the BBC production or the goofiness of THE ATOMIC CAFE but I did feel that I got my money s worth out of it and I would recommend it to my friends Oh and don t see it alone I think you d want to have a friend along to talk about the movie afterwards over your favorite dessert which you have been avoiding
0555,Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1989,I don t consider myself someone who s hung up on Star Trek continuity given a clever story device in a Star Trek film that contradicts some element of Trek continuity I ll usually swallow the plot device with nary a rumbling However I do think that the characters of the Enterprise crew and to a lesser extent the Star Trek Universe are important elements of these films Plots and dialog that compromise these characters and elements degrade the picture s quality after all if you ve got a good enough story but the Enterprise characters just don t fit it then do it as a non Trek story So what s there to say about STAR TREK V THE FINAL FRONTIER As a story it s lackluster below average by even the STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION series quality average On the flip side as a showcase for the Trek characters it s generally awful there are scenes that literally made me grind my teeth Certainly some of this might be laid at the door of aging actors but the vast majority seem to be due to an over all attempt to inject humor into the story at every point Previous Trek stories have either tried for more dramatic stories with comedy relief being just that well timed relief or STAR TREK IV which was a lighter story handled with a lighter touch Leonard Nimoy s In THE FINAL FRONTIER it seems that director William Shatner was trying for an Indy Jones humor action mixture Instead it tends to look like Kirk Spock and McCoy look more like the Ghostbusters or more accurately the Three Stooges Pratfalls malfunctioning gadgets Don Adams would have felt right at home on the new Enterprise and the packing off of the Trek second level characters to either walk on spear carrying roles or in the case of Uhura much worse all combined to make a film that was below the waterline throughout I saw STAR TREK II The Wrath of Khan the other night on the tube and while that s arguably the best of the series it shows how a good script can add to a character without giving them a lot of screen time Before the spoiler comments one point I ve heard of course how much money was spent to pay the regular s salaries this time around From the looks of this film the budget on the film must have been tight in the first place because the cheapness of the sets and the paucity of many of the special effects gave me the impression that Peter was borrowed from to pay Paul not to mention Bill De and Leonard There are scenes when several of the characters are climbing through parts of the Enterprise and their weight on the ladders cause the bulkheads to come off the side of the walls God only knows how far 23rd Century aluminum siding has come In summary if you re a Trek person you ll probably want to see it anyway my advice wait until you can watch it for one or two dollars For those of you who only liked the last film or perhaps WRATH OF KHAN skip it There are better films out there Not many but some Did Spock s brother remind anyone of Leo Buscaglia with ears Everybody hug I have to agree with the question posed by others what happened to David Warner s part Was the role any larger in the novelization The budget crunch seemed to hit the casting department as well there were a lot of extras but not many other actors and those that were there seemed almost a homage to some of the stars No not Harve Bennett as the Supreme Starfleet Guy Behind The Desk but Shatner s daughter and I must assume that whoever played the Romulan ambassador was sleeping with someone influential because she wasn t picked to play a Romulan 1 2 My guess Shatner for the way she goes cries out Oooh when she sees him threatened on the viewscreen Must be one of those sheltered Romulans Again the state of the sets The scene I referred to above was the climb up the shaft If you see this film again God forbid check out the scene where Shatner climbs up and the walls bend inwards Kirk apparently has an abnormal specific gravity In the acting department Kelley bothers me the most as he seems to be hamming it up for the back rows of the theater subtlety is escaping him more and more in his performances as McCoy As a character I thought Kirk suffers the most here Anyone notice the Imperial motif that Kirk carries around him First there was Kirk s nautical quarters and I couldn t decide whether the two crewmen who carry the stairs that go up to Kirk s shuttlecraft were due to a bad writing b the Enterprise malfunctioning motif c more problems with budgets or d All Hail Flash Kirk Savior of the Universe Other complaints Sulu and Chekov playing the Hardy Boys for laughs poor writing for Scotty and of course Uhura s fan dance The single worst part of the entire film Good points I did like a few of the more mythic moments such as Kirk s I ll die alone and his comment about losing his brother I thought he meant Sam and then getting him back Nice double play Also most of the Spock or Spock Kirk lines jokes worked well Please Captain not in front of the Klingons But a good time was not had by all not by a long shot All I can say is This looks like a job for Leonard Nimoy Or maybe Nicholas Meyer
0556,Ghostbusters II,1989,Summing up tag for GHOSTBUSTERS II A kinder gentler Ghostbusters And to borrow from PR rhetoric I mean that in the best sense of the term I found GHOSTBUSTERS II to be an enjoyable humorous and ultimately entertaining film It does have a different emphasis than its predecessor and that seems to be garnering it a good deal of criticism but I thought that GHOSTBUSTERS II s new outlook worked very well for it particularly as a sequel Let me back up a bit I ve always looked at GHOSTBUSTERS as another production model on the Bill Murray star Harold Ramis writer Ivan Reitman director assembly line a combination of talents who ve mixed up some particularly funny films STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS are the prominent examples With GHOSTBUSTERS they hit a chord from the best of the Marx Brothers movies characters who were absolutely wacko but who you were cheering for at the same time The opera scene at the end of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA The Boys vs Zuhl You re laughing at them and with them and at the same time you re going rah rah with the rabbis and priests and NYC residents outside Well I was GHOSTBUSTERS II concentrates a dollop more on the characters it introduced in the first film not a bad thing for a sequel its lower intensity results in a lower major guffaw hit ratio than its predecessor but it s a trade that I was willing to accept The Boys have a comfortable feel around them this time out if they don t build the story up for as many full tilt laughs as before it s because they re getting laughs through the intricacies and foibles of their characters Ray s cheery optimism and his enjoyment of Peter s schemes Igon s cold amusement and his little experiments and Venkeman s Game Show Host personality are all played around with more less amplitude but more fine tuning And they all parody their mock heroic image throughout Suck up your guts boys The Ghostbusters are here Peter s character Bill Murray has probably the most work done to it he s actually coming around to the idea of a relationship with Dana Barret Sigourney Weaver and her son Murray s played this type of character through many films and even more SNL sketches and it s pleasant to see it developed along the lines it is here And finally the Ghostbusters are up against someone rotten enough and defending someone good enough that you want to cheer a bit for them That s perhaps the biggest difference between the two films GHOSTBUSTERS is more of a laugh blow out movie while GHOSTBUSTERS II had me leaving the theater feeling good Amused too there were a lot of jokes I was laughing at during the screening I went to that the audience didn t seem to be reacting too but mostly a blanket smile Murray and Weaver are particularly good Murray s scenes with the baby were better than the entire length of THREE MEN AND A BABY They all react well together Ramis was fine Aykroyd a bit muted Ernie Hudson looked about 5 years younger I was never crazy about Rick Moranis s character and I thought it didn t change much from the previous film And I was a bit disappointed that Annie Potts s character wasn t still hooked up with Igon I thought they played off one another well The fellow playing the art director was OK I think Billy Crystal s Fernando was really demanded for that part Finally Cheech Martin has a tiny role but he has one of the best lines in the film Recommendation If you don t mind the satiric edge of GHOSTBUSTERS slightly dulled by more attention to the characters then see it Not a Totally Excellent film but quite good and fully entertaining
0557,Malenkaya Vera,1988,LITTLE VERA A disappointing slice of life film from Russia This movie touted as ushering in a new age of freedom and openness in Russian cinema turns out to be a failure primarily because of some bad filmmaking It distracts you enough that you don t care for the story nor the characters The only redeeming aspect of the film is a peek into contemporary Russian life which is hard to come by If Sergei Eisenstein and BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN is what you have come to expect of Soviet cinema skip this one Oh and I didn t say anything about the first scenes of sexuality on the Russian screen because there is nothing inspiring about it to talk about LA LECTRICE A delightful French film with Miou Miou as a reader who turns her passion for reading into a profession Her encounters with her varied clients form the background for a subtle and amusing film where fiction and reality fade in and out of each other She reads Maupassant to the bedridden teenager Duras to a lonely businessman who wants to be her lover Karl Marx on the value of precious metals to an old lady and Lewis Carroll to a little girl and an old judge wants to be read from Marquis de Sade The woman who sat behind me seemed to be enjoying it a lot more and made me wonder if I missed something because I didn t understand French too well
0558,Batman,1989,I haven t had this kind of fun at a movie since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK It s not that BATMAN is anything like that film but my emotional reaction was similar There s nothing quite like seeing a big film with an opening night crowd at a big theatre The crowd and I ate it up Tim Burton gets a lot of credit for the outstanding design work and also for staying in control of his players A project of this size has buried many a good man and just ending up alive let alone triumphant is a worthy accomplishment Burton doesn t talk down to the audience or spoon feed plot points to us My faith in animators as directors is stronger than it s ever been The look of BATMAN is pure eye candy This is some of the best art direction I ve ever seen It s on par with that of BRAZIL and BLADE RUNNER Shot after shot I found myself opening my eyes wide just trying to drink it all in Books are stories told with words and movies are stories told with pictures The pictures in this movie are poetry There are images I m never going to get out of my head and I don t want to try Michael Keaton in whom I had doubts was dead on target as Bruce Wayne The risk Burton took with this controversial bit of casting paid off in spades I actually bought Wayne as a playboy millionaire with some very serious emotional problems bubbling below the surface The emotional scars of the event that warped young Bruce are clearly present even before the details are revealed in the film Comic book readers know what that event is already As Batman Wayne doesn t so much take on another personality as he buries his own He becomes almost more machine than man as I could reasonably expect from someone who felt compelled to put on a costume to fight crime Batman isn t so much a good guy as he is an anti bad guy Revenge of the calculated sort is clearly one of his major motivators Another motivator is style I think one of the keys to the Batman character s success is that we all secretly wish we could do what he does Who wouldn t want to fight evil using awesome intimidating aesthetics and superior technology as weapons Face it Being Batman could be way cool Jack Nicholson triumphs as the other side of the same coin The Joker He manages to do three things which I might have thought mutually exclusive any one of which is difficult for even good actors to achieve First he is right out on the edge without losing control Compared to The Joker his character in THE SHINING was a calm trustworthy and compassionate soul Second he is genuinely funny He not only gets all the best lines he makes jokes with his body language Third and particularly impressive in combination with number two he is viciously maliciously deeply evil I mean that given the choice between spending time with The Joker and hanging out with Frank Booth BLUE VELVET I d be at Frank s place with bells on One of the happiest accidents to befall the production was Sean Young s broken leg I think Kim Basinger did a much better job than Young would have as Vicki Vale I m very much enjoying the current trend away from dumb women in movies Vale is of course a mere mortal there is after all room for only one super hero in this movie but an intelligent one She may need rescuing now and then but she s quite capable of helping While slightly bothered at first by her relationship with Bruce Wayne I came to realize how important it was to knowing Bruce s character and providing a window into his emotions It also never hurts to have someone to rescue I think a key to Batman can be found by paying attention to who else he rescues in the film I must also single out the editor for some praise The pace is taut shocking or flowing depending on what is needed Some of the scene transitions are a real gas In spite of Prince s somewhat disappointing songs which are fortunately only a tiny part of the movie the music is satisfying and supportive of the action In typical Tim Burton fashion some off the wall music adds spice to a few key sequences One of The Joker s henchmen carries around a boom box which plays everything from Prince to an elevator arrangement of Beautiful Dreamer The Batmobile and Batplane which are mercifully never called such in the film are stunning Burton has a talent for mixing the right amount of cartoon physics into his live action and he applies it well to both the vehicles and other key shots The sense of motion in BATMAN is clearly born of animation and that s a very good thing I know they were nervous but I ve got to hand it to the execs at Warner Brothers for even allowing this film to get made It is not the sort of thing one expects from Hollywood these days I can only dream of the day when Terry Gilliam gets the kind of support Tim Burton has managed to muster The studio bigwigs can relax now BATMAN is going to be pulling down the bucks by the bucket See it soon See it with a big crowd
0559,Batman,1989,It s hard to know where to start on a supposed blockbuster film such as this It s been hyped up so much on rec arts movies it s ridiculous and there s been lots of controversy about whether or not Keaton would be able to fulfill the role of the Dark Knight respectfully enough that it wouldn t be a laughable thing In my opinion at least Keaton did a very good job bordering on excellent However in all honesty I would have to say this is definitely Nicholson s movie Both actors did an excellent job of captivating the attention but Jack exuded an irresistible magnetism during his parts that didn t allow my attention to waver at all The beginning of the movie starts us off in Gotham City which looks busier than New York City during rush hour A family walks down a street together heads through a seamy alley and gets mugged by a gang of hoodlums The hoodlums go to a nearby rooftop to count out their loot and one begins to express his fear about the mysterious creature that s been haunting the night lately the Bat Apparently many of the 2 bit hoodlums in the city have been plagued by the same vision leaving the ambulance attendants who pick up the nervous wrecks as well as the policemen in an utter state of confusion The Batman has of course noticed this mugging and proceeds to stealthily glide down upon them a spooky sight if there ever was one for a criminal They shoot him and Bat falls down only to rise again in a few seconds sending the thieves into an utter state of terror After Batman dispatches one of them he dangles the other over the edge of a rooftop while the blubbering thief pleads for his life The Bat says that he will not kill the man but that he wishes him to give a message to his friends that He is out there The thief asks in a tremulous voice who he is and the 2 simple words I m Batman send the theatre into spontaneous cheering and clapping From then on we cover the newspaper angle a bit and discover Ms Vicki Vale a la Kim Basinger She is the staff photographer for a major magazine and has come to Gotham to find out more about this mysterious Bat Ms Basinger does an excellent job as Ms Vale displaying her professionalism and street smartness as well as her personal side Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne does a very believable job of how Bruce Wayne could actually be after the trauma of his parents being killed He is first seen during a charity bash he is hosting and his mansion looks as big as a fabled English castle Wealthy beyond belief he seems initially quite cheerful and lighthearted but as the movie progresses we see more of the real Wayne serious concentrated and locked inside a world of his vow to stop crime Ms Vale s initial opinion of Mr Wayne before having met him is a vain egocentrical playboy after having met him however is another matter And of course Jack Nicholson Jack begins as Jack Napier a very powerful criminal apparently pulling capers in the city paying police kickbacks to keep them off his case and seems to be an underling of a crime boss Grissom who is played by Jack Palance Grissom apparently decides Jack has outlived his usefulness and cleverness to him and asks him to personally supervise the robbery of a chemical plant After Jack and company leave to plan said robbery Grissom telephones the police and tips them off to it In the ensuing police shootout the criminals almost escape except who should show on the scene but Batman what a surprise Batman corrals the majority of criminals quickly and almost nabs Jack except for the fact that as he nabs Jack Jack s right hand man nabs Commissioner Gordon along for the sting and threatens to blow his brains out After Batman lets him go Jack kills a police lieutenant the one who he had paid the money kickback to and the Batman comes back to apprehend him Jack fires a bullet it bounces off Batman s body armor and shatters a nearby gauge which send shrapnels of glass into Jack s face at which point Jack falls over a railing and Batman catches him Unfortunately Jack happens be over a chemical tank loaded with chemicals apparently part of which is a nerve gas the government had banned from use some years back Whether it was Batman s conscious decision or whether he could not hold on we cannot say but Jack falls into the chemical tank and later arises He goes to a back alley surgeon who tries to doctor him up as best he can but he cannot undo the nerve damage Jack has suffered to his face it has fixed his face in an unalterable grin Going a little nutso at this point the Joker is born The movie is fraught with battle murder and spectacular special effects interspersed with the secondary storyline which is the developing relationship with Bruce and Vicki and as it turns out later the Joker Apparently the Joker has developed the hots for Ms Vale as well and means to make her his own The interaction between the 3 is very well done especially with the Joker s twisted insanity One of the funniest parts of the movie is when the Joker is in an art gallery with his goons on the way to Ms Vale One of them is carrying a boom box with of course the Batman soundtrack inside and watching the Joker and his goons caper and dance about is worth the price of admission itself The battle scenes are quite well done with martial artists climatic fist fights and the wonderful array of gadgets the Batman has including the Batcave complete with real live bats the only question is who did he get to construct it the Batplane a marvelous collection of gadgets inside a sleek stealthy plane in the shape of what else a bat and of course the fabled Batmobile Some of the effects with the Batmobile were done with computer graphics I m convinced like the Batmobile s shields to protect it from harm It s quite a stunning piece as are the rest of Batman s gadgets However it is the acting which it should be in all good movies which gets the movie it s excellent rating The final battle between the Joker and the Batman is quite impressive and proves Batman to be a mere mortal after all in fact in some places Batman gets out of his inevitable death by sheer luck And as we find that Batman created the Joker SPOILER we discover the Joker has also in effect created the Batman In the interests of leaving this movie a bit of a mystery I ll leave it for you all to watch Give this one 4 to 4 5 out of 5 stars Excellent movie and possibly the best blockbuster movie of the summer Go see it Today Now
0560,Batman,1989,Capsule review A triumph of visual imagery over story for the music video generation Ironically Keaton is better as Batman than Nicholson is as the Joker The art design is superior but just about everything else is pedestrian Better than the television series or the serials not as good as the comic Rating 0 Excuse the pretentiousness of starting a review with an 82 year old quote but Adams might very well be talking about BATMAN whose images often contradictory or of clashing styles far overpower the flyweight story that binds them together BATMAN is a triumph of visual imagery over story While Jack Nicholson is the top billed star his character is paper thin and just as flat We are down here to the level of villains whose biggest crimes can be explained only by nastiness Nicholson apparently was chosen not because he had a single responsive chord for the man behind the famous face but because both are known for their smirking Nicholson does not even look the part His face is not thin and angular enough and his non angular body is better suited to playing the Penguin Of course it is a pity that the original model for the Joker is well past the point where he could have played the part Conrad Veidt best known for playing Col Strasser in CASABLANCA and Cesar in CABINET OF DR CALIGARI played the title role in THE MAN WHO LAUGHS a poor wretch whose face is twisted into a perpetual rictus grin His nightmarish look was reportedly the real inspiration for the Joker so he looked the role Nicholson can be a decent actor but he lacks range and in spite of all the fuss and expectation Michael Keaton is much better cast as Batman than Nicholson is as the Joker Keaton first of all looks the part of Batman That is not all that surprising if you realize what you are seeing is two eyes a perpetual frown and a chin Everything else is plastic shell Any actor with a chin and reasonable musculature could have looked good in the Batman suit Keaton s role was a little more demanding when he played the man behind the mask he is not a character out of Dostoevsky understand but his role did require a little acting and while he was neither superior nor memorable he was at least equal to the role Surprisingly Michael Gough played against type as a sympathetic Alfred the butler sort of a Batman s batman At one point he does severely overstep what the original Alfred would have done but that is a script fault not Gough s failing The story what there is of it gives us an origin for the Joker a touch of one for Batman and one fiendish though not very coherent scheme by the Joker which is f course foiled by Batman I will not say much about the Joker s scheme but it involves chemical contamination The Joker makes the part about chemical contamination quite public but apparently Batman is the only person to do a chemical analysis of the contaminated products To judge how likely that is the Berkeley ellness Letter reports The smoke from a single cigarette contains about 100 times more cyanide than did the two grapes from Chile that were impounded by government officials in March Any idea how many chemical labs got involved in analysis after that tiny level of contamination was found How likely do you find it that only Batman would do a complete chemical analysis of the Joker s product The plot also concerns what must be the world s tallest cathedral At a minimum it looks to be at least fifty stories tall That does not make for a believable story but it is there for visual style more than credibility In the quote above Adams talks about contradictory images and that is precisely what BATMAN offers There are wide mood swings from somber dark and brooding to just exactly the sort of tongue in cheek campiness that the producers have long promised would not be in this film Scenes of the Joker dancing Mardi Gras fashion to songs by Prince in front of cheering crowds are not classic Batman style by any means And when Batman laments This is not exactly a normal world this is not exactly a Batman sentiment Also one wonders how many worlds Batman has seen Again and again the story stops literally stops in a time out for a visual image One of the most ridiculous of these has the Batplane break off a confrontation with the Joker so it can fly above the clouds and be seen outlined against the moon looking like an aerial bat symbol If the script gives no explanation the cheer of the audience does Logic is less important than the visual image BATMAN is an art designer s film all the way Gotham City is a highly stylized New York City with the art deco of the 1930s and the futuristic feel of Fritz Lang s not Superman s Metropolis It is a collection of dark somber streets seen only at night or under overcast skies This is a film without sunshine To tie Gotham to the present the mayor of the city was cast not for any acting ability but because he looks like Ed Koch In spite of the beautiful visual design for the city the eye still rebels because of the matte paintings and building models that are just not convincing as being anything but mattes and models That is not a serious fault in a film with a strong story but when a film s strongest suit is its art design it becomes very important to execute those designs flawlessly Finally a word about the music Danny Elfman has written a decent score but choosing Prince to write the songs apparently for the nihilism of his previous work was as big a blunder as choosing Nicholson for his smirk Director Tim Burton claims to be a fan of Batman comic books but it seems to me they were better than his film I have to give the film a neutral 0 on the 4 to 4 scale I guess I did not expect better but I had hoped for it nonetheless
0561,Batman,1989,I think I made a mistake by rereading THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS this week While watching BATMAN I kept being distracted by things that were missing A few gaping plot holes and an almost total lack of tension mystery or danger in the film keep me from being able to recommend it not that I think there s anyone who hasn t already decided to see it eventually It tries to be dark but ends up just being dim with too few ideas to flesh out the gadgets and confrontations Not that there isn t a lot to like in here Jack Nicholson is spectacular as The Joker He sparkles in every scene partly because he s given every good line in the script and partly because Jack is Jack In the end this is really his movie since we see more of how and why The Joker operates than we see of the Caped Crusader This is perhaps my biggest gripe with the film We just don t learn enough about The Batman Sure they fill in and take some liberties with his history but the extent of his skills and motivation are left relatively untouched It s even more distracting given Writer Sam Hamm s and Director Tim Burton s pre hype comments about fleshing out his character and putting him at risk Michael Keaton s Batman just doesn t hold my interest and not because he s played poorly The script just doesn t give him very many interesting things to say or do Bruce Wayne on the other hand is done very well When Keaton is allowed to move his head and show some expression he s completely believable as a concerned and disturbed millionaire playboy Combine this with a pleasantly subtle portrayal of Alfred by Michael Gough and just about every scene within Stately Wayne Manor rings true Another selling point is the impressive art direction by Anton Furst I like his neo gothic vision of Gotham City it s big dark and oppressive while never smacking of BLADE RUNNER Besides it goes well with the nice reworking of all the Bat stuff The Batcave Batwing and Batmobile and the rest of Batman s paraphernalia are appropriately black and slick none of the blue and grey from the comics Burton s direction is unobtrusive a few interesting segues here and there but nothing that grabbed me like some of the things in BEETLEJUICE The orchestral score by Oingo Boingo s Danny Elfman was fittingly apocalyptic when it needed to be and the songs by Prince were kept in the far background shame too the few I heard on NPR were hot Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent are given scant attention which would have been okay if the filmmakers hadn t tried to fill the space with two unsatisfying new characters some newspaper reporter who s name I can t even remember and of course Kim Basinger as photojournalist Vicki Vale I didn t buy Vale s relationship with Wayne Batman for one second For being the centerpiece for most of the movie s confrontations her character s motives are never very clear Also the film too often slips into Damsel in Distress mode ruining claims that she s a tough independent reporter Worst of all the key scene between her and Batman is never shown All of a sudden something is very different you ll know what I mean Ugh In most cases a good villain makes a good thriller e g DIRTY HARRY TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A However BATMAN is not a thriller It ties some so so action sequences together with a nice look and an off the meter performance by Jack Nicholson I might go back to see it again at a cheap matinee but with all the dramatic potential that The Batman has I ll probably stay disappointed
0562,Batman,1989,Between all the hype and anticipation surrounding this movie I ve heard a good deal of discussion about whether the new film will be true to the Batman character That was not one of my concerns when entering the theater Over the last 50 years Batman s gone through any number of conceptual revisions he s been the grim spooky loner created by Bob Kane the gimmicky detective with the boy sidekick the TV camp buffoon and the obsessed driven vigilante who is probably over the edge of sanity My feeling was this Tim Burton could do damn near whatever he wanted to do with the character as long as he made the film work With that said this film is a mess A visual treat of a mess but still a mess If it was meant to lean towards satire spoof it s not nearly funny enough If it s meant to hold together as drama action the characters are cardboard and the plot is pockmarked with holes towards the end In any case the script and dialogue with the frequent but not continual exception of Jack Nicholson s Joker isn t exceptional to entertain on it s own it usually keeps moving the major exceptions are the scenes which seem tailor made to be used for the Prince MTV video for BATMAN but it s all over the place The conclusion suffers through Siskel Ebert s handy stupidity theory where people act ridiculous to keep the plot moving And there were so many sequences that seemed either unclear or muddled that I wondered if a lot of the film had been cut down from the original length or that some of the footage just didn t come out and they had to make do with what they had As to the acting Michael Keaton looks damned uncomfortable I still think he could have made a decent Batman because he has shown the ability to throw out a lot of intensity in his previous roles Here though it s monotone a stoic obsession that barely filters through his costume He s given a few opportunities to escape this as Bruce Wayne but it s almost as if he were still playing it in costume Jack Nicholson is fun to watch here and he is definitely given the lion s share of good lines in the film but this is not the exceptional performance I ve been reading about in film magazines It s over the top and he s definitely having fun with it but it s on the same par as John Lithgow s Dr Emilio Lizardo Kim Bassinger plays her usual damsel in distress character she ends up looking almost as strange as Batman and the Joker The other characters outside of Alfred aren t given much room to move in Billy Dee Williams as DA Harvey Dent is the only law enforcement official who appears to have his act together And if there s a sequel and he follows the comic book scenario he won t be working for the DA s office for long Jerre sp Hall walks in and out and Jack Palance can still hiss like a sunuvagun My favorite bit character was Bob the Joker s chief henchman who played the repo yard mechanic in REPO MAN Oh well The visuals in this film though are gorgeous and almost make up for the rest of the film Gotham City is a dingy fantasyland Wayne Manor is a moribund crypt of vengeance and the Batcave is lovely This is not a surprise visuals and miniatures have always been Burton s strong suit with his background in animation There s a scene with the Batmobile approaching the Batcave which is very well orchestrated between camera music and visuals The music by Danny Elfman is somewhat tinny at times almost like BEETLEJUICE over again I can t stand Prince but even if he was Peter Gabriel the backdrop of the Joker s music video escapades wouldn t have helped So what s the verdict Some of my disappointment could be put down to over advanced hype but I think most of it has to be laid at Burton and Hamm s door I d put this on a par with INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM a roller coaster ride but with better effects and a tolerable over blown ironic tragic air No depth whatever If you like a visual movie well enough go see it and see it in 70MM for that reason otherwise go find SAY ANYTHING or FIELD OF DREAMS at your local repertory theater Overall I thought the first half of the film was slow but held together the last half faster but started to fall apart early on On the good side the introduction of Batman on the roof I liked and the drive with Vale to the Batcave was great And the visuals of the Batplane over the city were a pleasure to see the entire art direction kept the brooding feel glued on A few complaints comments I m more amused than anything by this stuff Query 1 Where exactly are the Gotham City Police during the Joker s balloon money hoo haa As far as I see these guys only appear after they re all holed up in the church Query 2 Why does Vale try to drive off without letting her reporter friend in the car Never figured that out Not to mention why he throws himself on the hood of the car I d put that down to stupidity providing plot opportunity Query 3 It s just barely explained that the Joker is trying to make people believe that his white face is makeup why is this Is the flesh makeup his secret identity Character Concept Problem OK I can buy Batman with guns but firing missiles into a crowded street Attempting to murder the Joker in cold blood Punching him over the edge of the cathedral Blowing up the gangsters headquarters with them still in it I guess this is a Batman whose first interest is definitely vengeance over justice or protecting the innocent Judge Dredd in a Batman costume Perhaps it was Burton s intention but I felt that Batman while not portrayed as a villain like the Joker is portrayed as a fairly negative character Fine but that doesn t jell with him posing for his legendary shot in the final scene of the movie More on Nicholson Yes there were some funny lines but some of it like the TV commercials became tedious fairly quickly Like Keaton I thought he could have done a better job with a better script I ll be curious to hear how much this film deviated from the early revisions of the script by various netters who read it The Ending So Vicki Vale gives up her award winning career as a hostage err I mean a photographer to be the Batman s lover Licking her lips in the back of the limo I guess Alfred s kind of immune to odd behavior by then Well she does have a thing about bats I did like the bit between them about trying to love one another had a certain sadness that the movie could have used more of Made me wonder if the ending had been changed to make for a happy conclusion Also the police are awfully quick to turn over to Batman s side at the end but then they were basically straw men throughout There are probably more glitches if I thought about it but I ll leave it at that Overall I wished they d cut much of the background hooplah that went on during Prince s songs and spent the time filling in some of the gaps in the film
0563,Say Anything...,1989,Speaking for myself I really enjoy a good romantic comedy heavy on the romantic side Unfortunately there aren t too many good examples of that genre leaning towards the romantic It is a credit to John Cusack that he stars in the only two that really come to mind over the last five years THE SURE THING and now SAY ANYTHING Of the two I enjoyed SAY ANYTHING the most while THE SURE THING takes place in a reality I know exists SAY ANYTHING unfolds in a reality I know What is amazing what is truly amazing about this film is that it is able to nurture the spirit of romance in a setting that never forsakes its hold The Way Things Work to keep the romantic plot going Nothing less than hope for frustrated romantics everywhere The film opens with Cusack s character graduating from high school He s living with his sister played by Cusack s real life sister Joan in an uncredited role with only two things certain in his mind that he enjoys kick boxing and that he has fallen in love from afar with the the most brilliant graduate in his graduate class played by Ione Skye who hardly knows him from Adam Skye has just found out that she s won a prestigious fellowship to study in England starting in the next fall she is delighted almost as delighted as her doting affectionate father played by John Mahoney Cusack s character is hardly a scholar though his honesty and good nature alone make him exceptional but he manages to generate enough uneasy courage to ask Skye s character to go out with him to a graduation party She in turn gets the chance to encounter a wonderfully accurate group of people she has gone to school with for three years separated from by her exceptional scholarship And she finds herself liking Cusack s character very much This is one of those rare films where the plot could have fallen into the ruts of cliche at almost any point but through superior direction writing and acting scrapes off the layers of cinematic reworkings and literally shines John Mahoney s character could so easily have degenerated into the parent who thinks boyfriend no good role but he s witty and imaginative he affection and friendship with his daughter are immediately endearing and if he dislikes Cusack s character because of the threat he sees to his daughter s future you can also see his occasional delight with the special character Cusack plays Cusack Skye and Mahoney s characters are all wonderfully written and acted but the other exceptional point of this film is how well the smaller roles are created and performed The three girls who are Cusack s closest friends are a delight like ducats found on the side of the road during a pleasant journey They are funny without being absurd and telling without being preachy or sounding artificial Indeed it is amazing how much character the creative team is able to develop in so small a time Joan Cusack can t have more than a minute and a half in this film but she manages to create a harried worried loving sister during that time Get the message One of the two or three best films I ve seen this year and that includes the entire SIFF Don t take the chance that you ll miss it see it now
0564,Passion de Jeanne dArc La,1928,See at the Seattle International Film Festival THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC France 1927 Director Carl Theodore Dreyer Screenwriter Carl Dreyer Joseph Delteil Cast Maria Renee Falconetti Eugene Silvain Maurice Schultz Michel Simon Antonin Artaud Ravet Adre Berley Jean D Yd Print from the National Film Archive Great Britain LA PASSION DE JEANNE D ARC is Dreyer s critically acclaimed film that used the texts of Joan of Arc s trial to portray her inquisition and execution While I can t say that I was riveted by this film through its entire length I was constantly amazed by camera angles realistic you are there newsreel style footage and the restraint on facial expressions used by the actors It is not completely without hammy acting though Joan is particularly impressive as portrayed by Maria Renee Falconetti she plays Joan as a frightened young woman confused by the church s hatred for her but courageous and finally courageously resigned in her faith This was apparently Falconetti s only film role she certainly made the most of it The film is certainly designed to make the viewer sympathize with Joan but it does it through lighting music and close ups of the characters faces Again the film is not without sneering complacent villains but Dreyer tends to concentrate on their ignorance rather than any evil stereotypes There are also some rather strong scenes while Joan is being weakened by bleedings the audience seemed to visibly shudder as one This film was thought to be lost for decades the British National Film Archive restored this print which was recently discovered in a Norwegian mental asylum This must have been something of an inspiration to the inmates One wonders if it was next to a print of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST For general film viewers this may well be too dry but one doesn t have to be a cinema scholar to appreciate how pioneering Dreyer was in many of his celluoid story telling
0565,Honey I Shrunk the Kids,1989,I spent the entire Spring waiting for the blockbuster Summer but after the first month of it I feel like I ve been blockbustered once or twice too many INDIANA JONES A crisp production of more of the same of what never did a lot for me in the first place STAR TREK V Aren t you folks getting a little old for this sort of thing GHOSTBUSTERS II An amiable curtain call BATMAN Like DUNE somewhere in this darkness there is a great movie trying to escape but lost and confused I feel like Morris the cat Hollywood dishes out its treasures to please me and I stifle a yawn ungrateful jaded and spoiled wretch that I am I couldn t even have the satisfaction of reviewing these movies since everyone is going to see them anyway and all I would accomplish by writing reviews is to enmesh myself in time consuming arguments But maybe I m not so jaded after all Maybe way down deep I still am that little kid holding his mother s hand as he walks into a movie house in the days when theatres had only one screen and almost always ran double features to watch an absent minded professor floating through the moonlit sky in a Model T that went faintly glub glub glub Why do I think this Because of Disney s latest effort HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS Absent minded professor Wayne Stylinski Rick Moranis is working in his attic on a device to shrink things down to microscopic size Unfortunately his single minded attention to his work is causing family strains his wife spent the night at her mother s and his two kids pretty teen aged Amy and her genius kid brother Nick are a little worried Stylinski s next door neighbor Big Russ Thompson who is still coasting on his past glories as the supreme jock in his high school class thinks Stylinski is pretty strange but he has other worries Why is his lackluster teenage son little Russ so indifferent to football and fishing and all the other measures of true manhood Brings back memories After all his younger son Ron is keen on sports Why just watch Ron go into the back yard with a bat and ball to knock around a little though his aim is a little lousy since the ball goes through the Stylinski s attic window where it activates the unattended shrinking machine which sweeps back and forth and waits patiently menacingly for someone to walk through the door Okay you know what happens next And since you do the question comes up why bother to see this film Yes it s a familiar recipe but even the oldest recipe is tasty if prepared with the proper attention to the fine details The script is neat and so is the acting thank God for once Rick Moranis is not playing a moping super nerd the action moves along nicely the extensive special effects range from acceptable to downright impressive and even the Stylinski s obligatory cute little dog Corky is adept in his role Most pleasant is how this film takes an old Disney format and brings it up to date with little awkwardness Spielberg stole the Disney format and populated it with gimmicks and widgets in HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS Disney steals that infatuation with gadgets in turn and manages to use it with more wit and cleverness than Spielberg can normally manage The parents are modern parents I couldn t imagine watching a mom in Walt s lifetime realizing that her pretty teenage girl is lost along with a flakey teenage boy and muttering in apprehension They better behave themselves There are so many other deft touches subtle jokes like the endless stream of junk Big Russ loads into his RV as he s preparing to take his family to rough it or the strange way that whatever happens to little Nick his big four eyes glasses make it without a scratch One of the fine delights is the soundtrack which has that precise timing and calculation of the soundtracks to the best Warner Brothers cartoons and which in fact steals its main theme from those soundtracks Even the opening credits are a pleasure framed by a little cartoon that draws deeply from the best animation of the Fifties Given all this praise you might think I m saying that this film is the greatest thing in entertainment since the Walkman but that would be going way too far This is a little corny fairy cake movie not far removed from a Disney Sunday Movie based on an old format built on a familiar premise what makes it work is that almost everything in it is done right and that fact is the greatest pleasure in the entire thing Take the kids if you re a big kid go yourself Oh almost forgot HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS is preceded by a new Maroon Cartoon Roger Rabbit Baby Herman and Veronica in Tummy Trouble They do make them like they used to thank God
0566,Scandal,1989,If you plan to go to see SCANDAL because of the much publicized orgy scene which twice garnered the film an X rating prior to its release don t bother The scene has been trimmed to virtual non existence by an overzealous board of film censors What s left is a movie which considering its subject matter remains surprisingly unerotic SCANDAL documents the sensational events which lead to the toppling of Britain s conservative government under Prime Minister Harold MacMillan in the early 1960s It chronicles the sensational relationship between then Secretary of State for War John Profumo played in the film by Ian McKellen and alleged call girl Christine Keeler Joanne Whalley Kilmer in a standout performance an affair which shocked the nation John Hurt plays Dr Stephen Ward the osteopath who is obsessed with beautiful young women He takes Keeler and Mandy Rice Davies Bridget Fonda daughter of Peter under his wing and into his home This is the type of role which Hurt could play in his sleep upper class oozy and reptilian yet somehow sympathetic By contrast Joanne Whalley Kilmer is altogether stunning as Keeler She does most of her acting with her chocolate brown eyes and her physical presence dominates the film As Ward later tells her When I see beauty like yours I want to liberate it I could do wonders with you I could shock the world Ironic words indeed With Ward s social connections it is not long before he is propositioned by British Intelligence to use his women friends to entrap Russian naval attache Eugene Ivanov Jeroen Krabbe He complies by throwing Keeler and Ivanov together and daring Keeler to seduce the phlegmatic Russian Ward s connections also enable Keeler to mingle with government officials It is at a party at Clifton a country estate belonging to Lord Astor a friend of Ward s that she literally runs into War Minister Profumo wearing nothing more than a few palm fronds and a smile It s an introduction that needs no introductions The affair which transpires is notorious in its own right but made all the more so by Keeler s dual involvement with a top Cabinet official and a suspected Russian agent When Profumo demands her complete devotion Keeler refuses to leave Ward s flat and Profumo breaks off their affair In the meantime Ward does not stop at making socially correct introductions for his little baby He introduces her to London s Jamaican subculture where she quickly becomes involved with illicit drugs and the object of several drug dealers desires Two clash over her affections and the subsequent shooting incident makes the headlines The Profumo scandal breaks when a reporter from the Sunday Pictorial talks with Keeler about the shooting and Keeler hurt by Profumo s rejection confesses her relationship with him as well as with Ivanov and other public figures Once his involvement becomes public knowledge Ward s influential friends drop him and his life is destroyed He is formally charged with accepting money gained through prostitution although Keeler flatly denies the allegation As a result of all of the publicity Profumo steps down after admitting that he lied in his personal statement to the House of Commons a statement in which he vouched that no impropriety took place between himself and Keeler When the outcome of a film is known beforehand it is all the more important to closely examine the motivations of its lead characters In this regard the film is somewhat aloof On the one hand it might be understandable why a woman of Christine Keeler s age and background could be seduced into what was essentially a lifestyle of sex drugs and rock and roll a lifestyle which Wards tells her in order to enter one has to be very clever or very beautiful But that doesn t tell us everything One thing we do learn is that she does it for love Stephen Ward allowed her to enter his world and in return she loved him He was by her own admission the only man she had ever loved yet they were never sexually intimate This provides a moment of insight into her character for her there is a world of difference between love and sex Sex was her ticket to a more glamorous life On the strength of Michael Thomas s screenplay it would appear that the events surrounding the Profumo affair were certainly sordid The film successfully captures the flavor and vulgarity of England in the early 60s Sex in this world is portrayed as quick common and dirt cheap rather than anything meaningful or erotic What s left of the orgy scene is a total turnoff Much more erotic in a trashy sort of way is the sequence in which Keeler and her girlfriend Rice Davies dress for a night on the town They are filled with their own sexual power and though their weapons are lipstick and lingerie they are like two gladiators preparing for battle It is perhaps the only titillating scene in the film Everything else in SCANDAL is either lewd or sad by comparison an apt description for an affair which single handedly ended a political era
0567,Tenku no shiro Rapyuta,1986,I make no claim to being anything other than a novice anime Japanese animation enthusiast so I can t tell you how LAPUTA CASTLE IN THE SKY stands up to other anime out there I think it safe to say that it would probably be labeled a children s story by a casual assessor not that any self respecting adult can t swallow some hard earned sophistication and enjoy the Bejeezus out of it The story of a young boy and a mysterious girl who floats unconscious out of the sky is a fable cushioned in the very best visual imagery and invention Any show with this much imagination breaks the boundaries set by adult and children conventions and deserves a look The story is another variation on the boy girl quest story with a bit of environmental morality thrown in at the end some might find the story a bit simple and untutored I think it only enforces the air of innocence around the protagonists but there you go you ve been warned What really makes LAPUTA worth watching is the imagery fantastic sky vehicles anarchistic and futuristic at the same time Victorian villains and silly comic relief pirates with a nod of the head towards another anime production NAUSICAA and a sense of freedom that animation allows the gifted director to use Hayao Miyazaki is considered at the very pinnacle of anime directors and this film gives dozens of examples why Stephen Spielburg could learn some things about creative point of view from Miyazaki Rumor has it that he did I came away with so many delightful images from this film a girl floating down among the clouds enveloped in a bubble of light a impersonal then personal robot like something from a Moebius sketch rampaging through a fortress the idea of travel exploration and battle among the clouds There s work here that s every bit as good as the best of Max Fleisher in the mid to late 30s while this level of quality isn t constantly evident the work is never shoddy And the effect is magnified by seeing it on a large screen an experience animation fans are rarely allowed to experience The film isn t sub titled I cannot tell you how good the translation is though I have heard that the dialogue is toned a bit towards a younger audience though the effect can t be too severe from what I saw Good animation in my experience feeds the imagination suspends belief and takes you back to a cleaner younger self By that definition LAPUTA is very very good
0568,Last Temptation of Christ The,1988,Buddha once said All suffering is caused by desire Expectation is certainly an expression of desire and I certainly suffered through this film Considering all the controversy aroused by this film at least it could have been a great movie I would ve been satisfied if it were even a good movie The best thing I can say is that maybe this was an average movie atrociously edited The next best thing I can say is that this was a potentially good movie badly made In its best moments it reminded me of VIDEODROME someday I ll explain at its worst CALIGULA or DUNE But enough ranting here s the review What I thought was good about the film 1 David Bowie as Pontius Pilate One little scene well played When Jesus refused to do any miracles for him he says What a disappointment The best line in the film 2 Harvey Keitel as Judas A great original portrayal of Judas A wonderful performance spoiled only by the absurdity of what the script requires him to do Judas s character is so convincing that you can really understand his exasperation with Jesus But why would such a sensible guy follow such a lunatic as Jesus is portrayed in this film Only the writers know for sure 3 The scene where the disciples are waiting for Jesus to come out of the desert He s been gone from more than a month and they re beginning to have doubts Very believable conversations The scene is then spoiled of course by the appearance of you know who who promptly pulls his heart out of his chest holds the bloody gross thing out to his disciples and say Take this WHY Why would they want his bloody heart Why was this scene necessary This special effect wasn t even well done It looked like a magician s trick like he had a sheep s heart hidden in his cloak Up to this point it was a good scene 4 Harry Dean Stanton as Saul Paul A stellar performance and one of the few preachers in the film and this includes Jesus of course who seemed eloquent enough for the job and who the script gave something intelligent to say 5 The dream sequence not really a dream sequence things were ambiguous enough that you could actually interpret this sequence as actually happening then having God in answer to Jesus s prayer turn back time and put his back on the cross The girl who played the make believe archangel who was really Satan did a good job Jesus s confrontation with Paul Saul was one of the few scenes that didn t seem forced and stupid The scene where a few aged disciples are with Jesus on his deathbed worked well for me too It seems that this sequence and the conclusion was the whole point of the film The rest of the film was so badly done though that this ending does not justify it In fact I bet that if the rest of the film was better thought out intelligently scripted devoid of cheap stupid thrills and edited competently these last scenes and the movie itself wouldn t had drawn the disgusted protest that it did 1 The opening sequence of scenes This might have been because of bad editing but I felt like I had begun in the middle of the movie We have some guy falling down every few minutes hearing voices in his head talking to himself and all in all acting bizarre Then we see him making crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews on Everybody hates him he s extremely confused and doesn t seem very intelligent He follows a stranger thinking maybe this is an angel from God sent to lead me where I m supposed to go into a brothel He sits and waits while everybody else fucks the prostitute over and over and over again Barbara Hershey must ve been tricked like everyone else into thinking this was a significant movie to play such a compromising role Then when everybody s left he runs up to the prostitute and asks for forgiveness What s going on here What did I miss Who s that girl There s no setup at all for what happens in this film 2 The film did not tell a story It did not show any reasons for what happens in the film We simply jump from scene to scene and there doesn t see to be any connection between them One scene has Jesus make a fool of himself in the city Jesus makes a fool of himself quite often in this film and basically has to run for his life out of town The next scene has him riding into the town triumphantly with everybody greeting him WHY What changed their minds Who are these people Why is anybody still following this jerk Scorsese seems to want it both ways He assumes we know the story so he needn t dwell on details leading up to major scenes then he changes the details of the major scenes so drastically as to make any assumed story that ties them together ridiculous 3 There was too much gratuitous gore and gratuitous nudity in film Maybe the makers of the film will hide behind the cry of Authenticity but I say Bullshit This was along the lines of what you saw in CALIGULA a film that despite being offensive obscene depraved and artistically bankrupt had more continuity and sense in its script than this movie Do we really need to see a bunch of naked women all with good figures mind you jumping and writhing around while John the Baptist is preaching Is a graphic sex scene the only way we could know that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute Why did Jesus have to pull his bloody heart out Seeing one sheep s neck cut was enough There s no subtlety in this movie only excess 4 My biggest complaint is with the characterization casting and scripting of Jesus Not for any religious reasons They could have portrayed Jesus as a homicidal Satan worshipper for all I care I would buy it if the portrayal were convincing consistent and competent Jesus is portrayed in this film as a confused manic depressive hysteric who has a talent for miracles but the worst timing for them This guy is a real loser He hears voices he has pains in his head He s afraid to follow the voices he decides instead to build crosses to crucify people When he decides to follow the voices he does things like attack people who weren t bothering him wander into brothels get people cut up by Roman soldiers etc He s never sure if it s God or the Devil talking to him He changes his mind a lot He doesn t understand anything he s doing or why he s doing it yet he s always trying to convince everyone that something is the way out of all their troubles this something is always changing and he s woefully lacking in anything resembling eloquence when he tries to explain There are scenes in this movie where Jesus thinks I don t know what to say I ll just open my mouth and God will put the words there then he talks and says stuff that s completely inane Nevertheless he gets followers don t ask me how or why Jesus never says anything clever or profound or convincing in the whole movie so you have to wonder how he persuaded all these people to follow him especially when they follow him into a temple surrounded by Roman soldiers This is an especially troubling scene because when the moment of truth comes Jesus is speechless sort of faints after showing the crowd how well he can make his palms bleed and is hustled out of trouble while those who came with him are cut to pieces by Roman soldiers This characterization of Jesus is a cross between Agnes of God and Son Of Sam Willem Dafoe does not have an easy job to do and probably would ve had a hard time doing a conventional Christ Here he s a disaster His performance is all the more depressing when contrasted with the performances of the rest of the cast Keitel as Judas Hershey as Mary Magdalene Harry Dean Stanton as Paul David Bowie etc all did the best they could and as isolated performances they were all excellent they just got stuck in a dog In all fairness though it would have taken a great actor to pull off this role 5 The miracles in the movie were really lame Considering the character of Jesus was so low the miracles had to be the only rational reason that people might follow him Also it was a chance for this film to save itself with FX They seemed almost like parlor tricks the way they were presented And when ever Jesus really could ve used a convincing miracle he didn t deliver This is the harshest review I ve ever written of a movie but it deserved it I was not offended by the content of the movie There have been movies much more sacrilegious than this one There have been movies much more gratuitous than this one I was disappointed It was just a bad movie It wasn t even enjoyable in a mundane way It wasn t even daring Its daringness was hyped all out of reality It was just a bad movie I rank it somewhere between CALIGULA and DUNE give it a 2 on the Leeper scale 4 to 4 It would ve gotten even a lower score if not for David Bowie
0569,Dead Poets Society,1989,Few comedians command such respect as comics that when they pause a while for serious introspection the audience sits up and listens Robin Williams is such a performer In his latest film Peter Weir s DEAD POETS SOCIETY Williams manages to blend humor and pathos without compromising either fashioning a part that is both touching and appealing The action takes place at Welton Academy a stuffy upper class edifice of preparatory education rooted in pride and tradition Williams plays John Keating a charismatic English teacher whose unorthodox teaching methods endear seven of his pimply faced students to him ultimately changing their lives forever But these unconventional practices raise many an eyebrow amongst his fellow professors none the least of whom is the school s unswerving principal effectively played by Norman Lloyd of TV s St Elsewhere Williams character provides the essential catalyst in the story encouraging his pupils to reconvene the Dead Poets Society a scholarly opportunity he had as a youth to actively explore the language of Walt Whitman Dylan Thomas and William Blake Enlivening them Keating urges that they suck all the marrow out of life stimulating romance and passion and allowing it to drip from their tongues like honey Scurrying busily to a nearby off limits cave to indoctrinate themselves into their chapter of the club the boys resemble monks their hoods pulled up over their heads like habits flashlights cutting through the dense blue fog It s a superbly photographed sequence in a film which is both striking and technically excellent The scene is altogether magical taking on a special wonder But there is a darker side to the story however The boys huddle around Keating to look at the blurred photographed faces of their predecessors now housed under glass faces not unlike their own We re food for worms lads he tells them These boys are fertilizing daffodils now Life does not go on uninterrupted Their time too will come Keating inspires his boys to seize the day Carpe Diem to act on their impulses and be spontaneous free thinkers He teaches them non conformity by camaraderie One Neil Perry maturely played by Robert Sean Leonard pursues an acting career albeit against his malevolent father s wishes Another Todd Anderson played with quiet reserve by Ethan Hawke builds confidence A third Knox Overstreet played by Josh Charles finds true love at last Williams himself is a fine actor and his John Keating is a characterization of rare sensitivity It s certainly his best work since THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP GOOD MORNING VIETNAM might have been a more popular film at the box office but wasn t Robin Williams simply playing Robin Williams loud irreverent hysterical His role here is a far cry from that of the ostentatious freewheeling Adrian Cronauer but it is every bit as effective Contrary to the impression the previews would give us Williams role has been reduced to somewhat of a supporting one He does get to utilize his standard nightclub schtick but it s both in character and in context People coming to see the film simply for Robin Williams might be disappointed but they will also be missing the point DEAD POETS SOCIETY takes the often frivolous ingredients of classical literature love romanticism passion and turns them into a universal theme man s ability man s right if you will to think for himself to act with spontaneity Ask yourself when it was that you last thought about these subjects with anything more than a smile or with a passing cynical glance The film makes us the audience take a long hard look at what inspires us what governs our motivations and determines our actions It emotes feelings rarely felt in the movies these days Peter Weir skillfully handles a subject matter which in the hands of a lesser director might have come across as trite even laughable But he has gathered together a young ensemble cast of relative unknowns and allowed them much as Perry as Puck in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT S DREAM to shine In so doing DEAD POETS SOCIETY finally triumphs laying to rest the age old fallacy that the only good poet is a dead one
0570,Do the Right Thing,1989,Spike Lee who charmed the critics and audiences with the low budget SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT then disappointed people at least me with SCHOOL DAZE has made his third film and this time his work is both entertaining and important Lee clearly did the right thing when he made DO THE RIGHT THING This film is really the anatomy of a race riot And it is a film in three dimensions When it was over the kids from a black family sitting in front of me were disagreeing whether the blacks were at fault or the whites I found myself thinking how wonderful to have a film with conflict and without having the good guys and bad guys spelled out for me In fact nobody is entirely right and nobody entirely wrong That is what life is like Lee is a good enough director that he makes some blacks and some whites likable and some of each not likable DO THE RIGHT THING follows about 26 hours in the life of a neighborhood in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn Most of the action centers around Sal s Famous Pizzeria Sal himself played by Danny Aiello does not seem at all like the sort of person who would be the center of a race riot He has a genuine affection for the people in the nearly all black neighborhood He takes pride that the local kids grew up on his pizza Yet in the space of a few short hours on a hot summer day small irritations would boil over into violence Tantalizingly slowly Lee shows us how that happens We get to know the neighborhood and particularly an old drunkard nicknamed Da Mayor beautifully played by Ossie Davis But this film has many major characters and several stories being told at one time Lee has given himself a major role as a black man working out his problems and frustrations He has resisted the temptation to make himself either a good guy or a bad guy He plays just one more person in the neighborhood One of the more interesting subplots concerns the mini grocery run a Korean couple The locals wonder why this little grocery has proved so profitable when black businesses so often fail in the same neighborhood Some of the locals are unsure just what their attitude is toward the Koreans Do they resent them admire them or what And the question will become even more pointed when the night brings violence Issues of attitude come up through the day as groups in the neighborhood come in contact with each other in numerous permutations The issues are not just black versus white but also whether violence is ever right The film even concludes with contradictory quotes from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X on the justification of violence This may not be the best film of the summer but it is the most ambitious It is this year s MATEWAN low budget but satisfying like few high budget films This is an R rated perhaps a little strong for the children in the audience but they seemed to have gotten a lot out of it and the adults even more I rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0571,Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,1989,I went to see this SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS for pretty much the same reason that everyone else who s seen it did I thought Paul Bartel s EATING RAOUL was hysterically funny and was looking forward to more of the same Unfortunately the operative word in the title is scenes Some individual scenes are very funny but the movie as a whole would have benefited from judicious editing including the removal of at least two of the numerous subplots The plot is basically one of everyone trying to sleep with everyone else Frank is trying to seduce the recently widowed Claire played with surprising humor by Jacqueline Bisset in order to win a bet he has made with Juan if he wins the bet he gets Juan for a night In the meantime he s also carrying on an affair with Claire s daughter Meanwhile Juan who happens to be Claire s houseboy is trying to seduce Frank s employer usually referred to as the divorcee so he can win the bet and get the money he needs to pay a gambling debt Now the divorcee s ex husband Wallace Shawn overdoing the pathetic whiny part in the most disappointing performance of the movie also shows up only to discover that the woman he had run away with is now married to his ex wife s brother a playwright who gets into the act by entering the competition for Claire Rounding out the cast are a diet doctor played by Bartel the divorcee s crippled son who has the hots for Claire s daughter but is willing to settle for his new aunt an Aztec housekeeper with a penchant for dire predictions involving jaguars tearing people apart and the ghost of Claire s husband who is trying to keep his marriage alive even if he isn t Now this has a fair amount of potential for comedy However Bartel seems to have had trouble remembering that comedy is most effective when it is unpredictable He s certainly capable of great moments the opening sequence is one of the funniest I ve ever seen but the middle of the movie lapses into predictable musical bedrooms and with one exception the ending is obvious Overall I d give it 2 stars Wait for a bargain matinee or even better a videotape so you can fast forward over the parts which plod
0572,Honey I Shrunk the Kids,1989,Imagine being zapped by a laser beam and finding yourself reduced to the size of a cheerio Imagine battling bugs as large as Buicks Imagine having Rick Moranis for a father These are just a few of the horrors the title kids have to face in HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS the diminutive but enjoyable new miniaturization comedy from the Walt Disney studios The film continues Hollywood s fascination with our world as seen from a different point of view The film doesn t attempt to live up to the 1950s sci fi classic THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN the yardstick against which all like films are measured but it does have a charming harmless quality that s undeniably appealing Meet the Szalinskis nerdy screwball inventor Wayne Moranis wife mother realtor Diane Marcia Strassman children Amy Amy O Neill looking not unlike a young Laura Dern and Nick Robert Oliveri The products of Wayne s eccentricity litter their suburban home like dirty laundry but his piece de resistance is a shrinking machine which he keeps tucked away in the attic Moranis is no Fred MacMurray Disney s original Absent Minded Professor and it s hard to take him seriously when his eight year old son constantly upstages him Not that Moranis Wayne Szalinski has to show any range or depth of emotion but his acting abilities are stretched far more in the McDonald s soft drink commercial this film spawned than in the film itself On the other side of the fence live the Thompsons Russell Matt Frewer and Mae Kristine Sutherland and their two sons Russ and Ronnie played by Thomas Brown and Jared Rushton respectively Frewer desperately trying to shake off his image of television s Max Headroom is suitably gawky in the role of Big Russ Thompson His back and forth who s crazier than whom altercations with Moranis are consistently droll They are not so much feuding neighbors as mutually insensitive ones When younger son Ronnie hits a baseball though the Szalinski s attic window it accidentally triggers the miniaturization device Venturing upstairs to retrieve the errant ball he and Nick are struck by the machine s beam and shrunk Needless to say the two older children soon join them amidst the oversized dustballs on the attic floor Wayne returns home after having been snubbed by his peers at a scientific conference and proceeds to trash the contraption Sweeping up the resulting debris as well as his progeny he dumps them in the garbage What follows are the four Lilliputians big adventures trying to get across the lawn and back to normal size before dark Realizing that it s literally a jungle out there now Amy comments off handedly to her pint sized brother We re not in Kansas anymore Toto to which he retorts We re not in the food chain anymore Dorothy That aside and Amy s I have six hours to get home get big and get to the mall are two of the better lines in the movie There s a cute relationship developed between Amy and Russ and the film does make some valid points about living in suburban harmony and all that neighborly rigmarole The special effects range from downright cheesy to generally effective Of particular note are the flight of the bumblebee an exciting addition to the traditional buttercups as beanstalks scenario and the exploding droplets of water from the lawn sprinklers And except for the demise of an endearing ant the film keeps everything in perspective and is amusing and light hearted throughout The image of Moranis and Strassman dangling from a clothes line with binoculars trained on the grass is a particularly silly one In order to appreciate just how engaging the film is one need look no further than Tummy Trouble the Roger Rabbit cartoon which accompanies it That film in direct contrast is crass mean spirited and unbelievably violent Children about to go into hospital could easily be affected by this Maroon Cartoon s misguided portrayal of doctors and surgical procedures Viewers of HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS on the other hand might well think twice before stepping on an ant again It s certainly a most uncomfortable pairing and one which should have Uncle Walt turning over in his grave
0573,Peter Pan,1953,Every year around this time or during the Christmas season the Walt Disney studios unleashes one of its treasures on the general public The motivations behind this no doubt are to introduce an animated classic to today s younger audience an audience very different from that when the film was originally released Last year audiences were treated to THE LADY AND THE TRAMP This year it s the turn of PETER PAN a somewhat cruder film than that canine love story but one which manages to mix enough elements to keep the young in years as well as the young of spirit happily entertained even after they leave they theater Based on James M Barrie s beloved novel PETER PAN is a familiar coming of age tale to most people made all the more so by the recent rebroadcast of the 1960s television special starring Mary Martin This animated version is probably the only time Peter Pan has actually been played by a boy Even though the film is under 90 minutes long it does tend to get a little draggy towards to the end This is due in part to the fact that about two thirds of the way through the film peaks only to peak again not long afterwards Captain Hook battles Peter Pan and that infernal ticking crocodile and it wouldn t be giving anything away to say that the good guy triumphs They could have ended the film right there Instead Hook makes off with Wendy which sets up the second climax It s confusing for the younger set and repetitious for the older ones One cannot easily think about PETER PAN and not the songs which accompany it For example I Won t Grow Up and Never Smile at a Crocodile In this animated version the former is never heard and the latter only appears in an instrumental form backing the toothy protagonist s occasional appearances It s hard not to notice the backgrounds in the film These such as the pirate ship Skull Rock and scenes of London are exquisitely detailed The characters themselves seem somewhat flat in comparison often lacking in detail They register emotion more by a widening of the eyes than any kind of body language But the film really takes off when it shows us glimpses of these children s world from an airborne point of view The scene where the children fly over to London following the second star on the right is quite breathtaking much like those IMAX films about flight they show at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington And shots of Never Never Land also from the air are quite magical One of Captain Hook and first mate Smee in a boat with captive Indian Tiger Lilly is so beautifully animated that the water looks real Disney has always been able to convincingly bring water to life in all his movies remember the storm in BAMBI or the subterranean sequences in PINOCCHIO If you can ignore some of the film s minor flaws you should have a ripe old time at the movies Thirty six years after it was made PETER PAN still makes for a wonderfully colorful entertainment
0574,Great Balls of Fire!,1989,Capsule review A much fictionalized and glossed over account of the first year of Jerry lee Lewis s musical popularity and his marriage to his 13 year old cousin The film will be most remembered for Winona Ryder s performance Rating 0 Rock and roll biographies are popular of course since THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY GREAT BALLS OF FIRE promised to be a little different First of all this was going to be one rock biography that did not end in a snowy plane crash In fact it turned out to be quite different but being different did not make it better This is a film of uneven style ranging from occasional drama to musical comedy in the style of BYE BYE BIRDIE complete with production numbers The characters are flat and thin and the relationship to truth or even credibility is tangential at best Dennis Quaid s wild high energy mannerisms break new ground in his acting but surprisingly newcomer Winona Ryder as his 13 year old cousin and eventual bride is more than a match for him in attracting audience attention It may well be that Ryder is remembered for this film more than Quaid The film is a very light treatment of Lewis s first year of popularity A bigamist and a troublemaker Lewis comes to live and make music with his uncle His vision is to take the wild Black music he heard as a child and infuse it into rock and roll He is attracted to his young teenage cousin who idolizes him and one thing leads to another At the same time his first recorded song is a stupendous success We have all the standard cliched scenes of course We have the suffering rock and roll star playing someone else s idea of good music and failing then playing his own style and being really popular We have the unruly audience that is tamed by hearing the hero s music One touch that is unusual is Lewis s conflict with his famous evangelist cousin Jimmy Swaggart But there is no substance to the conflict besides Lewis first paying lip service to Swaggart s pontifications then finally openly defying them But really jarring are the segues into musical production numbers such as a whole high school suddenly dancing to his music and doing cartwheels what is a 13 year old doing in high school Quaid supposedly wanted to sing all the songs but apparently while he can flip his hair like Lewis he cannot do a passable imitation of Lewis s voice Lewis re recorded his songs for the soundtrack Far more than LA BAMBA or THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY this is a quickly forgettable summer film I give it a flat 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0575,Licence to Kill,1989,Timothy Dalton s back as James Bond in what appears to be a mixture of many plot elements from the book LIVE AND LET DIE the movie THUNDERBALL and various Miami Vice episodes The plot Tragedy strikes Felix Leiter the CIA agent who s helped out Bond many a time and who s undergone yet another facelift The culprit is a drug czar Bond goes on a revenge trip accumulating an impressive body count along the way remember Bond has the license to kill and he uses it liberally in this one In the process of his vendetta the Secret Service disowns him which makes for a renegade secret agent and for the first time in the series history a plausible cover story Story mostly sound almost even believable Dialogue I saw this at a college preview The audience appreciated some intentionally corny lines I m not sure how well the same lines would come across in real life I love James so much this from a girl who barely knows him That particular scene was a throw away There are a lot of very good wisecracks as well as self deprecating humor Special effects some pretty good ones some very complex Unfortunately there are continuity problems on some of the more complex effects Stunts likewise some very complex ones Gore count still cartoonland violence but this flick has the highest casualty count in years Characterization Bond s drifting closer to the book Bond than even Connery did He gets really bashed up in this one although unlike many a Bond book he doesn t end up in the hospital The villain s a suitable match for him this time around Product placement didn t seem very conspicuous Of course a Coast Guard Dauphin II had a big Aerospatiale logo on the side of it which I didn t notice when I examined one fairly closely six weeks ago Gadgets a few I get the impression that the gadgets were only introduced to bring Q on the screen who s an audience favorite It isn t really a gadget movie but they do use everyday household appliances spear guns lighters airplanes Stingers in interesting ways Overall review one of the best adventure films this summer and the best Bond since THE SPY WHO LOVED ME Easily on a par with INDY III and much better than the summer disappointments GHOSTBUSTERS II STAR TREK V BATMAN 3 stars out of four or a 7 5 10 on the genre sensitive scale
0576,Licence to Kill,1989,See A man eaten alive by a shark See A man impaled on the jaws of an earthmover See A man s head decompressed beyond recognition No this is not an ad for one of those so called video nasties but what you can expect to see in LICENSE TO KILL the latest James Bond film and second to star Timothy Dalton as 007 Bond is back all right bigger and bolder perhaps but children under thirteen take note certainly bloodier than ever Audiences have learned to expect girls gadgets and great stunts from these films but gore No thank you Mr Bond LICENSE TO KILL is the sixteenth installment in the seemingly endless series of James Bond films which began back in the 1962 with DR NO Back then Bond pictures could be considered more or less family entertainment Irrespective of the sex and violence inherent in the films they were never sordid or nasty They were never unpleasant Times indeed are a changin In the ensuing twenty seven years Bond has battled his way through several guises a good number of dry martinis and more than his fair share of women an advocate for safe sex this guy is not But in all those years Bond the man as well as the series has kept killing above board and respectable In LICENSE TO KILL however the producers have prostituted good clean fun for explicit violence The bloodletting is jarring and needlessly so This time around the globe trotting Bond touches down in such exotic locales as the Florida Keys Bimini and the fictional city of Isthmus On their way to the wedding of CIA friend Felix Leiter David Hedison in a reprisal of his role in LIVE AND LET DIE Bond and Leiter are alerted to the fact that nefarious drug magnate Franz Sanchez menacingly played by Robert Davi is within striking distance and the proceedings are quickly curtailed However Sanchez quickly escapes and does the dirty on Felix turning him into shark bait This scene is about as uncomfortable to watch as the chainsaw sequence in Brian DePalma s SCARFACE As the bad guy Davi is certainly one of the most formidable villains Bond has come up against at least in recent years He makes SCARFACE s Tony Montana look like Mr Rogers Bond swears revenge but M Robert Brown fearing that Bond will turn this into a personal vendetta insists that he take on another assignment Bond cannot and resigns thereby having his license revoked the film s original title Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto play the Bond girls In keeping with Bond s new found monogamy and 1980s image ex CIA operative Pam Bouvier Lowell is portrayed as a tough cookie and not just another bit of fluff However it isn t long before she hauls herself out of her military garb and parades around in her underwear for a scene or two Cute Carey but no Oscar nod this year okay Soto plays Sanchez s girlfriend on the make Lupe Lamora and gets to wear a lot of red outfits hussy that she is The usual wisecracks are very much in evidence a bloodied Felix shows up with a sign around his neck which reads He disagreed with something that ate him But this time the one liners are in bad taste because they invariably follow scenes of overt violence In THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS Dalton s first venture into the role of British agent extraordinaire there was on screen nudity for the first time in a Bond movie albeit brief nudity Now we have an occasional profanity stirred sorry shaken into the proceedings Some might call it keeping up with the times others a lowering of standards Gladys Knight performs the snappy GOLDFINGER inspired title song and it s the best musical motif in the film In earlier films John Barry s score was as much a character as the villain or the Bond girls themselves and it is sorely missed in this picture Michael Kamen who appears to be scoring every other movie release this summer steps in for Barry on LICENSE TO KILL but his contribution is mostly flat and hopelessly derivative The Bond films have always tried to top each other in terms of spectacular stunts and LICENSE TO KILL is no exception In fact the film s memorable conclusion is probably one of the most explosive action sequences ever put on celluloid But the problem with the film is the tone plain and simple Over the years the character of James Bond has slowly imperceptively segued from secret agent to super hero He has in his own way become an indestructible force in the movies a caricature of sorts Nowadays Bond is much like Freddie Krueger or Jason Voorhees whose wheelings and dealings this film often seems to imitate Moviegoers will have to wait a little longer for the latest incarnations of those familiar faces this summer but if your appetite for that kind of murder and mayhem needs to be whetted sooner than that you might want to check out LICENSE TO KILL first You won t be disappointed
0577,Licence to Kill,1989,Capsule review More action less campy self parody is the by word of the latest Bond film There is almost too little humor in this hard edged adventure film involving Bond s vendetta against a Panamanian drug lord Rating 2 Operative 007 had been getting older and softer as the series progressed The series had lost its hard edge In the early days Bond was a sort of all purpose thug for the good guys fighting people who were basically grandiose hoods toppling missiles or holding cities for ransom Later he lost the hard edge and became a sort of fop His foes were people wanting to start nuclear wars and or kill everyone in the world And the stories became more campy and more silly with more idiotic special equipment and more and more obvious product placements Around the time they made MOONRAKER the series hit bottom After MOONRAKER somebody must have seen that the series needed rethinking Since then the plots have been better constructed but there has been an uneasy blend of the tongue in cheek with some tighter storylines The choice of Timothy Dalton with a face like a Swiss Army knife and a sharp edge to match fueled speculation that the series was going back to hard adventure LICENSE TO KILL is the least fanciful Bond film ever made James Bond is no longer the lucky but greying fop he is young and vital and angry But for a couple of stagey stunts toward the end of the film this is a surprisingly serious action film There is a lot of story in this 133 minute film Even the pre credit action sequence advances the main story It is rare that it ever does and this time it really is an integral part of the plot Bond is helping old friend Felix Leiter played by David Hedison who becomes the first actor to play the role twice catch Sanchez a Central American drug lord Things go extremely wrong and Bond finds he has a serious vendetta against Sanchez played by Robert Davi whose pockmarked face adds a touch of realism Bond must track the drug lord to Panama thinly disguised under the name Isthmus where Sanchez ruthlessly holds his own empire through schemes involving drug running evangelists and Contras The credit sequence is once again stunning in spite of the instantly forgettable credit song by Gladys Knight Michael Kamen s score is not up to the classic John Barry efforts but it gets the job done Some aerial stunts are impressive though driving stunts tend to be a weak point in the film The characters lack some of the interest value of those in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE the only other Bond film with any credibility LICENSE TO KILL is a sign that the Bond series is improving I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0578,Matador,1986,MATADOR is a film about sex Not sex as even the most liberal of us would admit to knowing it but obsessive sex palpable intoxicating self destructive The sexual images in this film are sweaty and engrossing and all encompassing MATADOR may be in Spanish with English subtitles but sex on any level is a universal language Diego Montes played in the film by Nacho Martinez is the matador of the title El Maestro retired from bullfighting after having been savagely gored by a bull in the ring He walks with a limp drives a Mercedes and his chiseled features remind one of a Latin Jeremy Irons Women would kill for him if not on account of him Reduced to teaching his art to Spain s young and impressionable Diego hopes to mould a young trainee toreador Angel Gimenez played with gusto by Antonio Banderas Angel reminds him of how he once was passionate and altogether fearless Diego is surprised at Angel s lack of experience with women however and casts casual aspersions as to the young man s sexuality Incensed by the very suggestion Angel promptly rapes Diego s girlfriend Eva Soler played by Eva Cobo in a sensitively understated role in an attempt to regain his pride and indirectly punish his mentor Concerned by his subsequent brooding and that he might have done wrong Angel s overtly religious mother insists that he tell all in the confessional Instead Angel heads directly for the local police station where he not only confesses to the rape but falsely admits to a number of recent murders If this is his way of proving his manhood well talk about major psychological problems A pretty young defense attorney Maria Cardenal the vivacious Assumpta Serna takes on Angel s case Four murders are enough to begin with she tells him But we later discover that her interests are less with Angel than with his tutor She sees her involvement with the young prodigy as a way of getting closer to Diego a man with whom we learn she has more than a passing interest The interest is mutual however Diego follows her into a movie theater showing King Vidor s DUEL IN THE SUN While the two barely acknowledge each other s presence the resulting scene is a classic of flaring nostrils and heavy breathing Maria we discover is a lot like the character in Erica Jong s FEAR OF FLYING She too is in search of the ultimate orgasm that which transcends all others She has followed Diego s bloody career in the arena from afar collecting his memorabilia adoring his very being She admits that at the moment of sexual climax she imitates him using a stiletto shaped hairpin as her picador s lance When it becomes apparent that Angel s connection to the murders was a complete fabrication the film s emphasis shifts to Diego and we discover that not only are his hands less than clean but neither are those of his fervent admirer Maria Other than the videotaped recording of his final day in the ring a morbid reminder which Diego watches with curious fascination there are no scenes of actual bullfighting in this picture Human beings become in effect the bulls of Diego s trade Women are like bulls he instructs Angel Once you close in on them it s easy And sex if it is to be exciting must lead to death Maria gets her kicks from skewering her unsuspecting sexual partners in the throes of passion And similarly Diego has found that he cannot hang up his sword upon leaving the ring He still finds the nape of the neck between the shoulder blades a wondrous place a place where life ends and death begins These are two people obsessed by the same sick fantasy They are not the kind of people you would want to take home to meet your mother This obsession with the marriage of sex and death has never been made more apparent than in this film That director and co screenwriter Pedro Almodovar keeps these dark and dirty dealings amusing throughout is a credit to him and his craft Almodovar whose previous credits include last year s Academy Award nominee WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN draws a fine line between acceptability and poor taste The film is never sordid however always upbeat and attainable and the director s ability to handle such primal themes with comedic resourcefulness is most invigorating This is not something one would expect from a film which opens with a scene of its leading character masturbating to video images of women being tortured beheaded and mutilated The only disappointment in the film is its reliance on a somewhat hokey denouement concerning psychic phenomena and an eclipse of the sun This film is after all a murder mystery and these clues placed at the very end help the police solve the bitter crimes However this ending seems jarring and out of place in a film full of bizarre characters and less than conventional images But if you re in the mood for a stylish piece of erotica then MATADOR should leave you panting for more
0579,Jacknife,1989,The issues raised in JACKNIFE are not new Neither is the film s approach If you really want to watch a provocative film which examines the effects the Vietnam War had on those who served in the offensive and those who waited for them back home check out the likes of THE DEER HUNTER or better still COMING HOME The fine performances in JACKNIFE are worth the price of admission but the story and screenplay fall short Three men serve in the same platoon in Vietnam and become the best of buddies One is crazy one is smart and one is scared Robert De Niro naturally enough plays the crazy one Joseph Megassy or Megs The scared one is played by Ed Harris THE RIGHT STUFF almost unrecognizable in his role as David Flanagan a burned out beer guzzling truck driver Ironically the smart one never returns home a victim of a Vietcong bullet Remembrance of the friend left behind becomes the central theme in this story His death haunts David with frightening regularity We are treated to occasional flashbacks of combat sequences which do little to further the drama They are all too familiar in a story about coming to terms with oneself after the horrors of war David lives with his beleaguered sister Martha played by Kathy Baker Their relationship is the only thing of any stability in his life She is his comfort and his companion but cannot ease his conscience Latent fears are stirred in David when Megs shows up on the scene acting on a promise that the two of them go trout fishing together Predictably De Niro is attracted to his buddy s sister and the drama begins to unfold in damp suburban disharmony The bleak Connecticut background provides a peaceful contrast to that which both men were subjected to a month previously Sporting facial hair last seen in THE MISSION De Niro walks through his role with ease He gets all the good one liners his idea of an elegant cocktail is a Bud and lives life in the fast lane literally from speeding in his friend s truck to smashing his fist through windows when he gets perturbed Perhaps in an attempt to attract moviegoers the producers gave the film a snappy title All that JACKNIFE actually refers to is the wartime nickname De Niro s character was given because he used to crash big rigs when he was younger All in all it s a pretty shoddy marketing ploy Harris on the other hand has a much more difficult role yet it is hard to feel sympathetic towards him He plays what has sadly become a stereotypical Vietnam veteran role psychologically scarred tortured by guilt a little bit responsible full of denial He drinks to forget But the real star of the film is Kathy Baker She is a jewel in an otherwise ordinary production Her part motherly spinster part shy retiring violet of a Biology teacher is so well developed so fine tuned that it s hard to tell where her character ends and the actress begins Director David Jones is no stranger to acting threesomes His 1983 film BETRAYAL brought together Jeremy Irons Ben Kingsley and Patricia Hodge in a powerhouse drama of infidelity In JACKNIFE Jones once again manages to milk fine performances from his three leading players but what s at fault here is the material itself You can t help feeling that with a better script this too could have been a formidable drama Instead the film disappoints The able cast tries its best but the writing just isn t there and that fact soon begins to take its toll on the proceedings Stephen Metcalfe adapted his stage play STRANGE SNOW for the screen On stage this might have worked better as the plot would no doubt have taken a back seat to the actors presence and vibrancy On screen however the story and its mundane treatment wear pretty thin pretty fast Admittedly the film appears to be full of good intentions but all too often it comes awfully close to being stuffy and self righteous We have after all seen and heard all this before No one is denying the reality that was Vietnam but this movie paints its after effects in an inappropriately pat and self effacing style JACKNIFE is not a bad film it simply fails to say anything new about the post Vietnam experience
0580,When Harry Met Sally...,1989,If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Woody Allen should feel sincerely flattered by WHEN HARRY MET SALLY Rob THE PRINCESS BRIDE Reiner s latest romantic comedy The comparisons between this film and Allen s ANNIE HALL are inevitable Reiner almost seems to be inviting them in fact But whilst it doesn t quite match that film stylistically it does come awfully close on occasions The film stars Billy RUNNING SCARED MEMORIES OF ME Crystal and Meg INNERSPACE D O A Ryan in the title roles They are two mismatched individuals she an aspiring journalist he a successful political consultant who meet and fall in love yet don t fully realize it until twelve years afterwards Prior to that revelation the two of them bump into each other on two separate occasions and end up discussing love sex and marriage Harry s philosophy on life is that a man can never be friends with a woman to whom he s attracted because the sex thing always gets in the way Nevertheless he finds Sally empirically attractive What follows is a love hate relationship in which the hate often outweighs the love When Harry and Sally meet for the third time in twelve years it s in a book store There s a man staring at you in Personal Growth comments Sally s girlfriend Marie She s played by Carrie Fisher of Princess Leia fame and together with Bruno Kirby as Harry s best friend Jess provides the two leads with staunch acting support The screenplay by Nora HEARTBURN Ephron who also serves as the film s Associate Producer is well structured but misses some of the insight and astuteness which garnered ANNIE HALL an Academy Award back in 1977 the year this new film opens ironically Nevertheless it remains consistently funny with writing of the In a city of 8 million people I have to run into my ex wife calibre But the nicest surprise is Meg Ryan s performance as Sally Frankly it s a gem Although not known for her comedic talents director Reiner certainly brings them out in this movie Working shoulder to shoulder with Crystal a comedian of considerable skill Ryan is never out of her depth and often outshines him Crystal s rendering of the smug know it all Harry often drifts into some of the characterizations which populate his stand up routines and it s distracting at times His character doesn t develop much throughout the course of the movie In fact one of the few things that does change about Harry is the length of his sideburns Sally on the other hand develops significantly The scene in which she learns that her ex boyfriend has recently married is a joy to watch Ryan s red eyed rag doll hysterics are spot on and beautifully realized And there s a scene in a sandwich bar which is an absolute riot WHEN HARRY MET SALLY opens with a bouncy nostalgic jazz tune reminiscent of Woody Allen s later films Reiner also intersperses the action with documentary style interviews a common Woody Allenism between married couples Seated against a pastel backdrop they discuss how they met and how after all these years they re still together And the film s subject matter itself New Yorker s neuroses about sex marriage and relationships is prime Woody Allen territory Moviegoers who don t particularly like Woody Allen but enjoy his brand of humor might get a big kick out of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY At its worst the film is simply derivative But at its best it holds its own against some of that director s finest work
0581,Lets Get Lost,1988,Everybody has a story about Chet Baker He was bad trouble and beautiful LET S GET LOST Bruce Weber s visually thematic biography of 50s jazz musician Chet Baker might well be the ultimate story an evocatively photographed seamlessly edited collage of sights and sounds Unfortunately many people are going to pass up the film for two reasons one it s a documentary and two it s in black and white But those two elements alone combine to make LET S GET LOST more compelling than most of this summer s run of the mill movie fodder The life and times of this jazz trumpeter and vocalist whose troubled career culminated in a fall to his death from an Amsterdam hotel window in May of 1988 is chronicled through a variety of cinematic techniques Candid interviews with an ensemble of friends relatives and fellow musicians stills archive footage of Baker himself in concert and out moody mesmerizing iconoclastic Baker s whisper like vocals permeate the background like cigarette smoke ever present softly punctuating the blank spaces It s a near perfect blend of styles yet it is never showy or pushy In his 20s Baker was the James Dean of the jazz world his boyish good looks as much a part of his image as his hypnotic trumpet playing and soulful lyrical style Working initially with the likes of Charlie Parker and Gerry Mulligan Baker quickly branched out on his own Soon his angular face was gracing record jackets everywhere He even appeared in a number of movie bit parts such as 1955 s HELL S HORIZON billed as Chet Baker and his trumpet as well as a number of disposable Italian teen flicks Almost forty years later the change is dramatic Baker s once Adonis like looks are wizened wrinkled creases of skin abound aged hollowed out eyes bloodless cheeks a leather faced lipless junkie Baker knew more than anyone that you gotta pay the price if you wanna play the blues Baker s Midas touch on stage became leprous in his private life A compulsive womanizer he left a legacy of cast off wives and embittered offspring in his wake There is a lot of hate in this movie few people have much respect for this burned out unlikable shell of a man Even his mother when asked if Chet was a good son cannot answer in the affirmative What s so compelling about the film is that as unappealing as Baker is his music is anything but The only time that we feel he s being totally honest with us is when he s performing Then and only then do we feel the man s sincerity his quietly hushed and sexy vocal style totally absorbing the viewer The allure of his stage persona compared to the shambles of his personal life is staggering In one scene Baker recalls the names of other jazz greats who have succumbed to the lure of drugs The list seems endless But this is not an anti drug movie It s a film about contrasts about the profound affect one man had on the lives of others Director Weber has gotten to the crux of the issue so adeptly that at times it s hard to believe that a lot of this film was shot before Baker s death At Cannes nearing the film s end Baker comments to Weber that this is the first time he has ever faced such a rowdy audience At those other places you could hear a pin drop he observes So when he calls for silence before performing his final haunting number Almost Blue you probably could hear a pin drop That silence and the performance which follows is a fitting elegy to a genius who lived hard yet made it all look so easy
0582,UHF,1989,Just saw UHF last night at a packed sneak preview at MIT I always wonder if the free ticket and the rowdy crowd influences me at such previews but I truly enjoyed the film Of course it is really stupid but so was AIRPLANE a movie that you could easily compare UHF to The movie was very funny with lots of sight gags and it didn t stall very often in my humble opinion The beginning is very funny with his parody of Indy Jones and of course one of the best moments had to be a song Weird Al s version of Money for Nothing will leave you rolling one of his best yet Plot is simple Weird Al takes over a loser TV station and makes it a winner with such programs as Wheel of Fish Wide World of Phlegm and The Young and the Dyslexic Their star is the former janitor at the dreaded Channel 8 which tries to put them out of business As in AIRPLANE the plot is a parody Just stand up and tell them we re not going to take any dirty floors Of course the crowd fave at MIT was the engineer And everyone went berserk over a line which most others will think mildly amusing Congrats You just won a drink from the firehose Explanation getting an education at MIT is often likened to trying to drink from a firehose Well overall this was as good as AIRPLANE but I m sure a lot of people won t like the silly type of humor and might feel their 6 bucks wasted Who cares It was free for me and I laughed the whole night
0583,Return of Swamp Thing The,1989,Just when you thought it was safe to venture back into the bayou along comes THE RETURN OF SWAMP THING part monster movie part parody wholly if not intentionally awful Not since King Kong and Godzilla first slugged it out atop Mount Fuji has there been a more laughable or more ludicrous man in a monster suit movie The first film of the summer season to be based on a character from a D C Comic THE RETURN OF SWAMP THING plays it strictly for laughs In Wes Craven s original 1983 horror flick Swamp Thing was portrayed as a sad tormented creature the hideous result of research gone awry In this its purported sequel Swamp Thing has been transformed into a superhero ridding the swamp of botched genetic experiments and rushing to the aid of damsels in distress One such damsel is the exquisitely untalented Heather Locklear Locklear who should stick to making health spa ads is cast as Abby Arcane stepdaughter of scientist gone mad Anton Arcane played once again by Louis Jourdan in the scenery chewing role of the century Abby visits her creepy stepfather in his heavily guarded Louisiana mansion in order to discover what really happened to her mother all those many moons ago Arcane isn t telling but somehow you get the feeling that she didn t pass away under normal circumstances Realizing that Abby s rare blood type holds the key to his fountain of youth elixir Arcane and his beautiful henchwoman Dr Lana Zurrell played with campy panache by Sarah Douglas immediately have diabolical designs on the ditzy blonde family ties or no family ties From the opening scene we learn that Abby has a very special relationship with plants Not only does she call her succulents down to earth names like Jimmy and Mary but she holds entire one sided conversations with them This is I guess just so we know that come the time when she and Swamp Thing inevitably meet she s going to be able to relate to him woman to vegetable Sure enough this encounter takes place when Swamp Thing rescues Abby from a pair of lecherous moonshiners Barely batting a false eyelash at this living lump of lichen Abby immediately senses the soul of a wonderful human being beneath that mossy exterior Extraordinary as it might seem it s love at first sight To pad out its ninety minute length the film introduces a stereotypically pudgy twinkie eating white kid and his precocious black pal who are in the movie to try and photograph the fibroid avenger for commercial gain In actual fact they re in the film to be laughed at even though they do get to say some real neat lines like Swamp Thing s kicking some butt They also get to give the leafy fellow complimentary thumbs up from time to time just so we know who the good guy is Everybody in the film overacts like crazy and these two obnoxious youngsters are no exception It s hard to dislike a film as good natured as this one is especially in an industry rife with gratuitous sex and violence Sure the film does have its explosive moments courtesy the five and dime special effects but ne er a drop of blood is spilled throughout And there are ample opportunities for nudity Locklear and Douglas weren t employed solely for their acting abilities but none ensue Abby and her new found beau do get to express their love for each other but it s tastefully done if in a slightly silly manner as is everything else in the film From the very beginning you realize that this is not a film to be taken seriously Though harmless enough it does tend to be rather smug and a little too cute for its own good and you end up laughing at the film rather than with it If it weren t so badly acted so deliberately self mocking all around then it might have made for better entertainment As it is THE RETURN OF SWAMP THING remains strictly for the grade Z crowd The only thought that appears to have gone into the making of this movie is that the producers decided not to call it SWAMP THING 2
0584,Do the Right Thing,1989,After having watched SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT and SCHOOL DAZE getting me to go see a Spike Lee movie isn t particularly difficult Any writer and or director who can spin characters such as his during the length of a film gets attention because gang there ain t many out there who can What Lee has done with DO THE RIGHT THING is to jump yet another notch up in my estimation he s using his abilities at characterization to examine the personalities and emotions in a neighborhood which lead to a violent incident the kind of complex event that is so often explained away with a simplistic rationalization or off hand prejudice By spending a day with each person and detailing each of their personalities and their relations with one another in such detail we come to understand why and how they get to the state their in by the end of the film and in turn to be caught up in the intensity of the conflagration that engulfs them It s not a new concept in film to be sure but it rarely done this well trying to center on these many people and build complete characters out of them by the end of the film is a monumental task for a writer or a director because by the end of DO THE RIGHT THING it s absolutely necessary to understand where these people are coming from or the whole film doesn t work Lee make it work Some characters are more in focus than others but no one is a stereotype or a cardboard reactionary with the exception of the local police officers However the film is about the people in the neighborhood not the police the police s purpose is a plot device a catalyst to the community s feelings their individual feelings and their individual actions This is also one of those films where script and direction are so on target that it s difficult to gauge the quality of the actors suffice it to say that no one gives their role less than it s due I imagine I d give credit to Lee and Danny Aiello as Mookie and Sal in particular as they have two of the most complex roles to deal with but several of the other actors score deep marks by the end of the film in particular the actor who plays Radio Raheem As striking if not more so than any individual performance is the photography and editing in DO THE RIGHT THING often the way a person is photographed tells us as much about their thoughts as their expression or their dialogue It becomes very difficult towards the end to remember that there s a screen between the audience and the characters that familiar comfortable barrier is broken down by Spike Lee by the end of this film This is not a film where you ll walk out and switch back to what you were doing before you entered the theater it required a cooling down period and a good deal of reflection and conversation in my case A brief side note from some of the net traffic it appears that a number of people see the film as promoting racism or excusing racial violence or something of that nature I can t see it Lee presents a number of points of view and allows us to understand why each individual feels the way they do during the length of the film As for justifying any particular viewpoint I must have missed it other than racism is bad The only thing that confused me were the quotes by Martin Luther King and Malcolm X at the end The person I went to see it with suggested something that appeals to me however that these two differing views of the use of violence in regards to racism simple in the axiomatic nature are contrasted with the complex situation and feelings that confront the members of the block in Bedford Stuyvesant The only person who clings to these viewpoints through the film is Smiley who appears to be simple the Mayor arguably the most sympathetic character in the film to me anyway has a hazy less clear cut philosophy that provides no easy instruction Do the Right Thing Humans follow ideals but they live with what they run into in life The Mayor and the title of the film deal with this type of situation no easy situations or answers but the necessity of Doing the Right Thing is underlined
0585,Licence to Kill,1989,Pity me I began going to see James Bond pictures right when Roger Moore took over the part I didn t find out quite what I d been missing until the Guild Theater in Portland began running the entire series twice a year one of the few theaters with class enough to serve Vanilla Cokes and I got a chance to see DR NO FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER I would admit that there were other non Connery Bond films I enjoyed ON HER MAJESTY S SECRET SERVICE is a favorite for Diana Rigg if nothing else and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY seemed to want to go back to an espionage storyline but in general trips to a new Bond picture were saved until everything else of interest had been seen accompanied by an air of resignation that was usually fully justified When Timothy Dalton took over as the new Bond I couldn t have been more pleased while THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS dragged a bit at the end and had exceptionally weak villains the first half was everything I could want from a Bond picture When I heard that LICENCE TO KILL would have a script written for specifically for Dalton THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS had been written with Moore in mind I was even more hopeful that we were heading back towards the good ol Bonds Well we ve still got a ways to go but things continue to look up LICENCE TO KILL has several strong points some depth to Bond some interesting companions a strong villain some real suspense find some of that in a Moore Bonder and some opportunities for Dalton to stretch in the role The problems with the film can generally be summed up by changing the instances of some in the last sentence to more There s still too much emphasis on stunts and not enough on characterization suspense and movie espionage As opposed to real espionage e g LeCarre LICENCE TO KILL is a tantalizing film because you can hear the motor revving up during its entire length it s just that the engine never seems to catch The film concentrates on Bond on a mission of revenge and Dalton does a good job with this his obsessive drive to avenge a murder occasionally clouds his normally cool judgment and he has to depend on the help of several friends to survive a very nice touch Dalton continues to play Bond as the professional of DAYLIGHTS this is a Bond who is an assassin and he works like one the double oh licence is not for show unfortunately the script centers on Bond s obsession so completely that he s still fairly one note I kept feeling that John Glen Michael Wilson and Richard Maibaum needed to be violently jarred during this film and told to tone down the stunts and keep the plot beefed up Things get too loose before the final stunt battle sequence which is admittedly a doozy Other actors Robert Davi who s played villains for years seems to really be picking only the cream of the crop for Bad Guy roles these days Sanchez in LICENCE and the Jersey don in the current WISEGUY arc He s not a Gert Frobe or a Klaus Maria Brandauer but he does a nice job with it I really wished the script filled in his character a bit It s a bit much to swallow underground cities of SPECTRE agents and island retreats with private armies these days a South American drug kingpin has the same general capabilities and a touch of realism to boot Carey Lowell is excellent as Bond s lover accomplice it s a little much to see her get teary when someone else kisses James after she s held her own in a bar fight but that s why the phrase artistic license was invented also Bond Women Anthony Zerbe plays a variation of all those flunky roles he used to play in Quinn Martin TV series David Hedison makes Bond movie history as the only man to play Felix Leiter twice a real first He also played Leiter in LIVE AND LET DIE Too bad he didn t have the Flying Sub in the opening sequence The rest of the actors are no great shakes with the exception of Q who doesn t overplay the role too badly this time Ah hell all of us engineers love him anyway We d all like his job And while we re at it whose idea was it to stick Wayne Newton in here Bless your heart my ass Overall I found LICENCE TO KILL to be a good deal like THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS strong start but weak towards the end Fully entertaining enough though and better than any of the Moore Bonds Keep Glen company under tighter control next time out and let s have some more meat to the plot these guys show promise for producing a Classic Bond in the future that could stand up to the Big Three
0586,UHF,1989,Shall we start with the bad news The plot is cliched and holey the bad guys might as well be made of cardboard and after the opening scene the next 20 30 minutes fall dreadfully flat But in spite of all that I would rate Weird Al Yankovic s new film UHF a 7 on the ISIYVAHIT Infamous Send In Your Vote And Have It Tabulated 1 10 scale Why Weird Al s strength is in the art of parody And the film is full of satire that hits right on the mark this turns the entire movie around Blockbuster movies television shows music videos and of course some classic commercials are targeted and nailed Also included in the film are some of the world s oldest gags But in a perhaps inadvertent fit of brilliance UHF does a better job of telegraphing them than Western Union could ever hope to and in doing so allows one to revel for eons before the punch line is finally delivered Who cares if you can guess what s in the closet It s still funny when they open the door A couple things to watch for that I didn t catch until they were mentioned in the closing credits A clip from that other classic Mars Needs Women and a cameo appearance by Dr Demento listed in credits as Man eating whipped cream No one is going to hand Yankovic an Oscar for his effort this is hardly great cinema However if you go in looking for low level laughs and some wonderful satire on all sorts of modern pop culture targets you will have more fun than you can wave a spatula at
0587,UHF,1989,I always have a certain fear when I make recommendations for a movie I fantasize that one day I ll be sitting at my computer tapping away on the keyboard mumbling to myself when suddenly I ll be snatched out of my chair by two meaty hands and lifted up until my feet are dangling in the air which is even more frightening than it sounds considering I m six foot four with my nose pressed into the face of some pre hominid who has a face like a Rottweiler with a complexion problem I hear the voice of doom in my ears ARE YOU DA GUY WHO TOLD ME TO GO WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY ON DA STUPIDEST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IN MINE LIFE And I ll forthrightly answer Well no I m just sitting here because he got a job in Piscataway and nobody s bothered to change the name plates on the desk yet Consider for example Weird Al Yankovic s new film UHF Let me explain what it is about first before I make any further comments on it George Newman Weird Al hisself is a chronic daydreamer who likes to create perverse fantasies from popular cinematic scenarios which results in some interesting footage for the viewer but also gives him a problem with holding down a job Fired from a long list of menial jobs George is getting ready to give up hope when his gambler uncle wins a run down UHF station Channel 62 in an idle game of cards He doesn t know what to do with it of course 62 is the worst station in the known Universe and probably in most parallel dimensions as well but George s lively aunt has an idea Let George run the station George is a little discouraged in his work at first but after a few lucky breaks manages to bring Channel 62 to the top of the charts with the help of some slightly unconventional programming This draws the wrath of RJ Fletcher owner of Channel 8 the network affiliate station and RJ is immune to cancer because everything in his body is malignant to begin with Okay nuff said you got the idea Now for the comments UHF is a thrown together film working on a low budget with little in the way of acting Weird Al is certainly not Oscar material or story the plot is like a watered down version of Mel Brook s SILENT MOVIE However the only important criteria for judging a comedy is DID YOU LAUGH And the answer is YES sometimes Make no mistake UHF dares to be stupid and keeps it up from start to finish it s like Weird Al is taking blind shots at you in hopes of hitting your funny bone and succeeding on occasion though never to the point of getting on a roll Still when there are yuks they re good ones I liked this film though I can t say I feel extremely enthusiastic about it Will you like it The answer to that question is probably the same as the answer to this one Do you enjoy reading a MAD magazine from cover to cover And if I steered you wrong don t come looking in Corvallis I ll be in Piscataway
0588,Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey The,1988,Capsule review For the beauty of its photography and the originality of its concept this fantasy from Australia and New Zealand is the best that has been seen in America for several years Yet it loses points because of a muddled narrative that leaves the viewer wondering what the story was really all about Rating 2 It is March 1348 in Cumbria In a small mining village there is the certain knowledge that the Plague is coming Connor has been gone from the village for three months much longer than expected just finding out what is happening in the world Perhaps the Plague has claimed him His young brother Griffin waits for his return And Griffin suffers from enigmatic dreams perhaps visions of another world and a mission of faith perhaps an act of faith so great that God will intercede and protect the village from the onslaught of the Plague God wants the villagers to dig through the flat disk that is our world and come out on the other side the Celestial City There they are to forge a cross and place it on top of the mighty cathedral that commands the Celestial City When Connor returns with news of just how close the Plague really is the urgency of the mission becomes obvious They dig through the disk and find the Celestial City a city of great wonder though to our eyes it is just your standard 1988 New Zealand city Things we have come to live with are to the pilgrims eyes great sights and great dangers And so begins their adventure Stylistically filmed in black and white and in color THE NAVIGATOR beautifully re creates the life in a 14th Century village and a comparable view of life in the 20th Century though the color photography is much less interesting It is a story told on many levels not all of which are comprehensible The style of story telling is usually well told with the sort of duality of vision that THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY has We see the familiar but we also see it through the eyes of a strange culture Only at one point does this duality break down into slapstick worthy of a Terry Gilliam THE NAVIGATOR is an odd and murky fantasy that seems to be pointing to some deeper meaning that is somewhere beyond view As a fantasy it edges out even this year s FIELD OF DREAMS for originality of idea But in the final analysis the film narrative is muddled and the point of this exercise remains unclear I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0589,When Harry Met Sally...,1989,Rob Reiner is one of the few current major directors that most Americans can recognize by sight He has put on a little weight since his ALL IN THE FAMILY days but he is still recognizable But more than just having visual recognition he is also recognized as being a major directing talent After THIS IS SPINAL TAP THE SURE THING STAND BY ME and THE PRINCESS BRIDE one tends to expect a lot from him as a director One looks forward to a Rob Reiner film However this one was really disappointed by WHEN HARRY MET SALLY a film that seems to assume it has a wonderful warm and winning story but somehow just does not have a story to match its expectations The story is punctuated by interview insets much like Warren Beatty s REDS but here we have older couples who love each other and obviously have had successful marriages reminiscing about how they first met And as far as that goes the film is warm These insets take up only about six or seven minutes od the film and unfortunately it is in these insets that we find most of the characters we end up liking The main line of the story is about how Harry got coupled with Sally but since these people are more superficially cute than lovable and not always even cute there is something really missing in the connections between the insets and the plot Harry and Sally first meet after graduation when Harry was something of a male chauvinist and Sally was just a little cold They fail to hit it off Flash forward five years Harry is now something of a male chauvinist and Sally is now a little cold They run into each other in an airport and fail to hit it off Flash forward another five years to 1987 Harry is now something of a male chauvinist with a better sense of humor and Sally is now a little cold and has self doubts From there we follow the two trying to be platonic friends wondering if they should have sex discussing if sex partners are sincere discussing Harry s promiscuity ad nauseum Do we care Sure there is some voyeuristic appeal to hearing people talk about their sex lives Do we care any further about these people as people I did not I had the feeling that when these people walked off camera they winked out of existence Harry is a political consultant I m not sure what a political consultant does but Harry s friends don t seem to be political consultants and Harry never so much as reads a newspaper This is not creating a character Nora Ephron the script writer just filled in a blank labeled Occupation she did not create a character Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally are attractive engaging people and I was willing to find out about their characters sex lives while they were going well It did not make for great cinema but it is watchable When their relationship starts to sour both characters are pretty tiresome WHEN HARRY MET SALLY is all right as a piece of entertainment for a little while but it is by far reiner s worst film I give it a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale One final note Nora Ephron a female has a male character express the philosophy that a male cannot just be friends with an attractive woman without wanting sex with her I can just hear a lot of women saying Ah ha I knew it all along In fact the woman who lived next door to me in my first apartment said pretty much the same thing eyeing me suspiciously I will tell you what I should have told her It is a paranoid myth and is false You can go through life believing the worst of people and nobody will be able to prove you wrong But for the record women it simply is not true of all men If you use myth to rationalize negative behavior toward men it is you who are in the wrong
0590,Crusoe,1988,There have been many film adaptations of Daniel Defoe s classic novel about the enigmatic castaway These variations range from straightforward translation Luis Bunuel s THE ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE to sci fi parable the 1964 ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS to racially pointed satire MAN FRIDAY CRUSOE the latest interpretation of this saga is more in keeping with Bunuel s version and therefore the book itself but it suffers from deliberate pacing and a shallow uninspired viewpoint The twist here is that Crusoe is portrayed as a Virginian slave trader who journeys to the island of Guinea in the hope of purchasing low priced captives Aidan Quinn plays Crusoe and is in fine acting form But his boyish features complete with baby blue eyes are a little distracting as is his thick East coast accent Crusoe sets sail at an inopportune time of year weather wise and it proves to be his undoing The ensuing spectacle of model shop proportions pales in comparison to the storm at sea sequence near the beginning of INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE The shipwreck in CRUSOE could have used some of Indiana Jones adrenaline The film barely touches on Defoe s theme of man s fear of and difficulty in dealing with solitude This Crusoe doesn t seem to mind being alone at all There are a couple of scenes in which we feel that this existence is not as idyllic as it may seem but these are few and far between The arrival of cannibals on the island provide Crusoe and two of the natives with an opportunity for social intercourse Updating the novel to 1808 the height of the North American slave trade was no coincidence as the resulting power plays between slave and master would reveal But on no occasion does Crusoe refer to either one as Friday As far as presenting a unique vision or a refreshing outlook Walon Green s literal screenplay rarely works overtime But there s enough up there on the screen to appease the most undemanding viewer And it s buoyed along by an evocative Michael Kamen score which combined with the lush tropical scenery creates the film s principal mood As one would expect from cinematographer turned director Caleb Deschanel the film is lovely to look at But it would have taken a supremely untalented crew of individuals to travel to the Seychelles where the film was shot and make the surrounding topography look drab and uninviting But when the film does set up an arresting situation it rarely has the faith to develop it and ends up sitting on the fence It s almost as if the film makers couldn t decide what kind of a film they wanted to make The result is a film which hovers awkwardly between straightforward storytelling and social commentary On the surface CRUSOE might appeal to those who have either never read the book or who are looking for some ideas as to where to spend their summer vacation But don t go looking for any kind of depth or imagination Those elements like Crusoe himself are all washed up
0591,West Is West,1987,Synopsis A young man from Bombay arrives in San Francisco hoping to gain admission to college However his sponsor has left the U S and the Immigration and Naturalization Service thinks he is a Sikh terrorist He has only 24 hours to get married to a U S citizen or be deported Naturally he asks the only American woman he has met a thoroughly obnoxious punkette A comedy drama of culture shock Director Writer Film Editor David Rathod Producer Cristi Janaki Rathod Principal cast Ashutosh Gowariker Heidi Carpenter Pearl Padamsee The film is the story of Vikram a nerdish young man from Bombay who comes to San Francisco in anticipation that he will be admitted to U C Berkeley As things turn out his sponsor has left the U S for an indefinite period returned to India Vikram goes to one of the city s better hotels only to find that a single room costs 175 night rather more than he can afford He eventually ends up in a seedy hotel in the Tenderloin district perhaps the city s worst neighborhood The hotel is owned by one Mrs Shah a spirited salty or seedy might be more accurate immigrant from India She gives Vikram a menial job and he begins to explore America In his explorations Vikram visits a supermarket and develops a taste for junk food He meets Sue an obnoxious redheaded punkette when she shows up at the hotel with a punk rock band and some groupies trying to rent a single room for a party Later he runs into her at the movie theater where she works Sue then introduces Vikram to the San Francisco punk scene Vikram is soon visited by a zealous agent of the INS the Immigration and Naturalization Service It seems that the INS thinks he might be a terrorist and they want him out of the country Mrs Shah seizes the opportunity to offer to sponsor Vikram in the U S if only he will marry her niece In an act of desperation Vikram asks the only U S citizen he knows the thoroughly vile Sue to marry him and the story continues from there This is the first feature film by its director David Rathod and it shows at times Additionally of the 3 principal cast members only one has extensive acting experience and this is apparent also It s really not a bad movie perhaps the best description would be weak The film is weak in the following sense It is advertised as a comedy yet there is very little humor or comedy in the film As a drama it fares better although it has a rather slow pace obviously it s not an action film The culture shock angle is used extensively in the film but it is not handled very well it generates very few laughs
0592,84 Charlie Mopic,1989,If you are looking for a movie that offers something different than the usual cinema treatment of the war in Vietnam you are going to be disappointed with 84 MOPIC CHARLIE First of all the movie should be called 84 MUMBLE CHARLIE Throughout most of the first half of the movie the dialogue is indecipherable and in the second half it is only somewhat more understandable because the characters spend most of their time yelling This movie contributes nothing to our understanding of this war There is absolutely no topic dealt with that was not better treated in films such as PLATOON APOCALYPSE NOW or THE DEER HUNTER The only novelty of this film was the audience reaction to the dark humor of the film which to give the film maker the benefit of the doubt I don t think was meant to elicit the disturbing laughter it in fact did e g he s so tough he d eat the boogers out of a dead man s nose Har har har One by one the thinly developed characters in this movie get knocked off by the VC right up to the end As with all American films about Vietnam 84 MOPIC CHARLIE gives us no clue at all about what makes Charlie tick We have no idea why the North Vietnamese fight the Americans Perhaps this might offer American film makers a new approach to the topic of Vietnam The ground covered by 84 MOPIC CHARLIE has already been covered many times
0593,Killer Klowns from Outer Space,1988,Last night I spotted an unusual title on the horror rack of my neighborhood video rental place and decided to give it a whirl KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE turns out to be a real kick It s really much more than you d expect from a low budget horror comedy The Chiodo brothers serve up some original eye catching art direction in this wonderfully twisted flesh eating aliens story The character design of the malevolent bozos is a hoot I like the spacecraft that looks just like a circus tent I like the gun that shoots popcorn I like the cotton candy cocoons in which they encase their victims Sure the acting is bad So s a lot of the dialogue Although I do like the line the punk in jail gets after watching an incarcerated klown dispatch a pesky cop So What re you in for The important thing is that what little money there was went into the right places The pace is pretty good once it gets going and the whole thing seems remarkably fresh A lot of imagination went into figuring out new ways for the grotesque gang to take their victims And you get all of this in a PG 13 package with no nudity and no buckets of blood KILLER kLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE is rather refreshing in its own perverse way
0594,Comic Book Confidential,1988,A form of graphic storytelling receiving more and more critical and popular attention over the last decade has been that of the comic book I hesitate to even mention the B movie this summer COMIC BOOK CONFIDENTIAL tries to overview the history of comic book art in the US from its inception in the early 30 s to the present and also to underline how much things have changed and have not changed since their initial spurt of popularity prior to World War II Given that I have a rather long lived interest in the subject of comix it s a bit difficult for me to rate this film in regards to the general viewer suffice it to say that overall I thought the film presented an accurate well organized and most importantly interesting history of comix in America I have a few quibbles but I ll get to them later The film is divided into sections describing a time period or a close up on a particular type of comic book that dominated the period The body of the film consists of covers and artwork from comics being examined interviews with the people who produced them newsreel footage and period music much of this dealing with the Wertham Comics and Delinquency scare that occurred during the 50 s The periods generally covered are the Golden Age of comics and comics during WW II with William M Gaines Jack Kirby and Will Eisner changing times after WW II Eisner s THE SPIRIT the EC Horror Crime MAD series and the subsequent comic book scare and the Comics Code with Gaines Al Feldstein and Harvey Kurtzman the return of the Super Hero with Stan Lee the Undergrounds with Robert Crumb Spain Victor Moscoso Gilbert Shelton Dan O Neil and Kurtzman comics and art particularly RAW magazine with Art Spiegelman Charles Burns Francoise Mouly Harvey Pekar and Sue Coe and finishing up with a potpourri of new favorites including Lynda Barry Bill Griffith Jaime Hernandez Shary Flenniken and Frank Miller The interviews are short and to the point and most of the speakers are interesting the exceptions being Lee who always seems to be a parody of the show biz agent Kurtzman who seemed rather withdrawn when speaking and Sue Coe who was driveling art speak prejudice alert The rest are pretty good with the Eisner Flenniken Barry and Hernandez segments exceptionally engrossing The underground segment in particular is well covered with a particularly good Crumb interview you could just see the thought balloons over his head and some interesting comments from Shelton and Dan O Neil where does that guy hang out Many of those interviewed read from their works one of the few gripes I have with the film it hardly adds to the appreciation of the work being described and the story is rarely aided by the creator s attempt to do voice characterizations for all of her his creations I d put Hernandez and Flenniken down as the only two exceptions there Overall I found it entertaining and informative what you re interested in and a pretty solid overview of the subject Unless the subject of comix leaves you completely cold I think you ll enjoy COMIC BOOK CONFIDENTIAL
0595,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,1989,Followers of the ever popular Friday the 13th series i e those warped enough to have suffered through the previous seven chapters won t want to miss this latest installment It s certainly no worse than those earlier entries just as mind numbingly awful just as irritatingly stupid as all the rest With the possible exception of relocating the hockey masked assailant to New York City FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII JASON TAKES MANHATTAN follows the same exact plotting as its seven predecessors 1 bring Jason back from the dead 2 knock off teens 3 leave finale open ended Right on cue the film opens with Jason Voorhees who by now must hold some kind of underwater breath holding record being revived from his watery grave He boards a vessel upon which a libidinous bunch of graduating seniors are about to set sail on a celebratory cruise to New York The scene is set for mayhem of an ocean going nature Call it Camp Crystal Lake at sea if you will or The Love Boat splatter style As with previous films in this interminable series there has to be some catalyst some connection between Jason and the current short list of soon to be dead teenagers The link here is Renny Jensen Daggett haunted by visions of a facially disfigured boy from her past However it is revealed that the Camp Crystal Lake killings took place over thirty years ago Isn t Renny a little young therefore Don t expect anything in this film to follow any kind of logic These would be hackees are chaperoned by Barbara Bingham as Mrs VanDusen whose role is simply that of excess baggage and the familiar Peter Mark Richman who plays Renny s uncle and legal guardian Charles McCullough For a guy who doesn t believe in walking corpses Richman gives a pretty lifeless performance Actually the film s title is somewhat misleading as Jason and his quarry don t hit the Big Apple until about two thirds of the way through the movie And even then they predominantly frequent the dark back alleys and sewer systems of Times Square We might as well be back in the woods at Crystal Lake for all the audience cares The producers wasted a great opportunity to parody New Yorker s acceptance of bizarre looking outsiders The closest the film comes to lampooning itself is when a bemused Jason notices a billboard advertising an ice hockey game replete with appropriate headgear of course In the nine years since the original and best film in the series the audience appears to have changed somewhat Mothers with an entourage of five and six year old children seem to have replaced necking teenagers In earlier films the on screen characters habitually stripped off before being macheted or axed to death and the killings were always inventive with an emphasis on the graphic One could always go to these movies first to be titillated then grossed out But now the characters don t even have to take a shower before being sliced or diced Jason disposes of his victims so matter of factly these days that it s hard to determine what the real attraction is But like it or not there s something about this series that cannot be dismissed Successive films have reputedly made more money at the box office than their predecessors and the string of hits has even spawned a television series Not only that but no best dressed Halloween party attendee would be seen dead without his or her hockey mask Maybe we re all missing the point here Maybe Jason is a self appointed champion combatting adolescent promiscuity notice how any sexually active teen is permanently laid to rest Or maybe he s an anti drug proponent not one but two abusers in this film are efficiently done away with shortly after indulging Or maybe it s simply a question of the bigger the body count the bigger the box office bucks It s no coincidence that FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII JASON TAKES MANHATTAN is labeled a Horror Inc production for the film is about as pre packaged as they come As shrink wrapped slaying goes there is no equal and until moviegoers demand otherwise the uninspired trail of blood and body parts will continue
0596,Honey I Shrunk the Kids,1989,Of course one of the staples of the fantasy film has always been monsters Big creatures lumbering around have a certain fascination And one variant on the monster concept is to shrink the main character so it is the whole world that is monstrous DEVIL DOLL was probably not the first film about shrinking humans but it is the earliest so well known For the most part it did not show us the world from the small human s point of view It was however followed by more notable films which used the horror of being small DR CYCLOPS THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE the television show World of Giants not to be confused with Land of the Giants which was more in the Gulliver tradition than really being about shrunken people FANTASTIC VOYAGE which introduced micro miniaturization THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN INNERSPACE and this year s entry HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS Like THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN and INNERSPACE HONEY is basically a comedy though perhaps better because it was not so ambitious Rick Moranis plays Wayne Szalinski who works in a research lab in his attic for a major corporation He is working on making a laser beam squeeze most of the space out of atoms so that matter shrinks down Through carelessness and accident the beam is accidentally turned on his two children and the two children of his neighbor Russ Thompson played by Matt Frewer formerly Max Headroom They are swept up with the trash and put down on the far end of the backyard From there the story proceeds on two levels what is happening in the parents world and the adventures of the four victims as they try to return home Director Joe Johnston s story is much better told and ironically is even more believable when it is about the miniaturization victims On one hand you have a slapstick goofball comedy of the parents looking for their children on the other you have a nice little adventure film of four people trying to survive and make their way through the grass jungle of a backyard What is particularly nice about the film is the detail of the giant backyard The scale is roughly 1 240 and by gosh everything seems very accurate to that scale Stop motion insects were animated by a team including David Allen a disciple of Ray Harryhausen and they look very good A great deal of attention to detail was used in the big sets What is needed to do the sets correctly is a great deal of craft labor so filming in Mexico City s Churubusco Studios were labor is plentiful was a very intelligent decision The sets are surprisingly moody and artistically done In some scenes the presence of water betrayed the actual size of the sets but generally this film s miniature world seemed as believable or more so than in just about any other miniaturization film As a result HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS is much better than it seems it has a right to be I would give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale I suppose something should be said about Tummy Trouble the Roger Rabbit cartoon accompanying HONEY The most common complaint I hear is that it may well frighten children Perhaps and perhaps not The simple fact is that the cartoon is not very well constructed One thing rarely noted about a Bugs Bunny cartoon but nonetheless true is that it tells its story well Even if the story is just a rack on which to hang jokes it should be a well constructed rack Tummy Trouble is kind of a cheesy cartoon with a lot of forced humor and a basic story that does not make a lot of sense Bugs had a well defined likeable character Roger is basically just obnoxious Sure people laughed at it but it is a lower form of humor than the classic Warner Brothers cartoons just as the Three Stooges were funny but not of the quality of Laurel and Hardy
0597,Parenthood,1989,If one had to compare PARENTHOOD to another film one would have to say that at least in structure it resembles HANNAH AND HER SISTERS Like that film it is really many stories about one extended family As such it can tell several parallel stories at the same time Where it differs is that each of the stories examines different aspects of one phenomenon parenthood Also the individual characters here are a little more sympathetic and better characters from the point of view of storytelling One cares more what happens to these people Each of the individual stories is decent but the whole is considerably more than the sum of its parts and each story has bearing on the others In one plotline a parent seems not to use enough discipline while another warns against the discipline approach The result is a mosaic that views parenthood from many different angles and approaches and at times even comes near to restoring something that has been missing from film some powerful drama The patriarch of the family is Frank played by Jason Robards who is justifiably plagued by guilt over the lack of attention he have his children and is working it out by spoiling his wild son Larry played by Tom Hulce Frank s oldest son is Gil played by top billed Steve Martin Gil appears to be the most stable and successful of Frank s children but his career is souring and his eight year old seems to have emotional problems Frank s son Nathan played by Rick Moranis has an intensive program to turn his three year old into an adult genius by the time she is four But the most compelling story is of Frank s daughter Helen played by Diane Wiest whose life is a shambles and a desperate struggle to raise her two wild children While at times the writing is excellent director Ron Howard seems to feel the presence of Steve Martin requires an occasional timeout for Martin s brand of physical comedy He also throws in some happier moments that verge on being saccharine Their effect is to betray some of the more serious drama Perhaps PARENTHOOD comes up short when compared to an ORDINARY PEOPLE but with most Hollywood output geared to a teenage market we have to be grateful for the films that are engaging on an adult level I rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0598,Parenthood,1989,The promotional campaign for PARENTHOOD would have you believe that it s a light weight comedy about yuppies and their puppies While it does have many many funny moments it is also about the kind of exquisite pain and embarrassment you can only feel as a parent child sibling or spouse PARENTHOOD is a movie that wants it both ways The good news is that it succeeds Easily director Ron Howard s best film yet bouquets also go to the fine cast and the clever sensitive writing PARENTHOOD deals deftly with a large cast providing a panoramic look at several generations of a family Just when you think a character is going to be a cliche they do something unexpected as their humanity shows through And just when you think a sequence or situation is going to be tied up in a neat television bow in flies a twist right out of reality s quiver Unless you were born on another planet you will find yourself identifying with at least a few of the characters and their situations And you ll care about the rest of them I m not a baseball fan at all It s not that I dislike it but that it reminds me of watching paint dry But I ve never cared so much about the outcome of a movie sports event as I did about the Big Play in the Little League game The boy who plays Steve Martin s eight year old son evokes such a deep sense of child terror and loneliness that I cared about everything that happened to him PARENTHOOD is an adult film about being a child and a childlike film about being adults The giddy heights and hurtful depths of human relationships make it a delightful roller coaster ride Do yourself a favor and see it
0599,For All Mankind,1989,FOR ALL MANKIND is the kind of disc that makes you glad you own a laserdisc player It is currently available only on disc The director Al Reinert hopes this leverages into a theatrical release which would be followed by a release on VHS It is the story of the decade long Apollo program told in the words of the astronauts themselves and with the movies they shot in space It captures and recreates the excitement I felt back when it was happening Using interviews taped starting in 1976 Reinert lets these original extra terrestrial humans narrate a composite mission made up of footage from all the Apollo flights He spent years in NASA s vaults gleaning some of the best of their copious 16mm footage These shots some of which have never been seen outside of NASA were carefully enlarged to 35mm The whole thing is backed up by a wonderful Brian Eno score The awesome launch of a Saturn V the beautiful violence of stage separation and the views of the Earth from the Moon which changed forever our perception of our world are here in all their glory The superhuman astronauts listen to Country Western and Frank Sinatra make home movies and play with their food while traveling farther than any before them This is an intimate first hand account of one of man s greatest technological feats The CAV version of the disc includes a generous still gallery at the end of each side which includes each mission logo and a photograph of each crew The entire fourth side is supplemental material covering each mission where each astronaut is today the beautiful paintings of Al Bean and selections from pioneering fiction films about travel to the moon The analog audio track includes a commentary by Reinert on the making of the film If you have a player this is one worth owning If you don t yet own a player perhaps this will convince you to buy one If you see this title in the theatre some day be sure to see it FOR ALL MANKIND is an energizing and uplifting labor of love I m glad Al Reinert made it
0601,Abyss The,1989,A review of THE ABYSS that reaches beyond technical descriptions is at best very difficult to depersonalize This is a film that does not lend itself to neutral feelings THE ABYSS literally assaults the viewer s senses within moments of the opening credits The style of the film now well established by Gayle Ann Hurd and James Cameron in the earlier TERMINATOR and ALIENS is that of forcing the viewer into a participatory role Only in a very few shots is one allowed to sit back as an observer and watch the ongoing scene Rather Cameron is relentless in making the camera maintain an active role in the narrative This motion picture attains new heights or depths of cinematic claustrophobia The one film in memory that comes even close to THE ABYSS in this area is DAS BOOT with its hydraulically operated steadicam plunging headlong through the narrow passage way and water tight doors of the German U Boat In THE ABYSS this is far surpassed as the camera doesn t limit its high speed charges to straight lines but runs around corners ducking bulkheads power cables and walls of rushing water Most of the people sitting near me in the theater were tightly gripping the armrests on their seats and moving visibly in reaction to the events on screen The cinematography is simply astonishing Underwater photography can often be really distressing to watch Often the view is muddled the voice overs and foley work are guesses and the lack of continuity between the two is very disconcerting There is none of this in THE ABYSS Working in the controlled environment of an abandoned nuclear power facility Cameron was able to maintain a near perfect balance of sight and sound The specially made diving gear always allows a full view of the actor s face and built in microphones provide a measure of realism that has never been seen before in an underwater film It takes awhile to realize that most of the brilliantly conceived miniatures and matte paintings you re seeing are not miniatures and paintings at all but full size set constructions The few models and mattes utilized in THE ABYSS are so clever in their construction and use that it will require some serious nit picking to spot most of them The special effects are the best that Industrial Light Magic has to offer The acting is top notch with Ed Harris really coming into his own in the lead An interesting choice was that of ALIENS and TERMINATOR veteran Michael Biehn as the pressure psychotic heavy Aside from Harris Biehn and a few others the cast is pretty much made up of little known character actors They form a terrific ensemble and are thoroughly convincing in their respective roles Chris Elliot of the David Letterman Show The Guy Under the Seats has a small role as a technician on the surface support vessel As disorienting as the relentless pace of the film is the viewer never has problem staying with the film s tightly woven narrative This is due in part to Cameron s direction but equal credit must go to the intelligent screenplay and world class editing Any entertainment that can achieve this frenetic pace and still hold you for well over two hours is remarkable indeed One of the texts we use in a History Significance of the Motion Picture course states that To succeed in all respects a film must tell a story set a mood and entertain the audience On this score THE ABYSS is right on target I cannot recall another film which more quickly or effectively suspends reality and draws you into the world on screen As a film THE ABYSS gets four stars as a roller coaster it gets five
0602,Abyss The,1989,Capsule review A science fiction and adventure film that just misses a 4 rating Alistair MacLean type action combines with 2001 type vision to make a whale of a film that blows BATMAN right out of the water Rating high 3 If only it had more interesting science fiction ideas Note THE ABYSS is a fairly long film at 140 minutes Enough happens that it would be impossible to say much about the film without revealing a surprise or two I will try to keep my comments general enough to avoid marring the enjoyment at least for some one who has seen other reviews still I wouldn t want to read what follows before seeing the film THE ABYSS has two kinds of scenes exciting scenes where suspense is building and exciting scenes where there is slam bang action And they must have about equal screen time As such it may well out Lucas the Star Wars films In style most of the film resembles less fantasy films than films in the Alistair MacLean tradition In fact embedded in this long film is really a normal length MacLeanesque adventure that would not even be science fiction Not that MacLean adventures are not somewhat far fetched themselves And like a MacLean film THE ABYSS is not above throwing in the occasional far fetched coincidence to keep the story going But the pacing and adventure plotting are reminiscent of a film such as THE GUNS OF NAVARONE or ICE STATION ZEBRA The action is not even delayed for opening credits the film starts under a single opening title and we cut directly to the action The U S S Montana a nuclear submarine has picked up something unusual on sonar a very fast moving craft They see it accelerate to over 130 knots before the sub is physically grasped by something They are freed but not in time to avoid piling into the edge of the Cayman Trench A team of civilian divers from a nearby oil driller is brought in by the Navy to try to rescue any survivors The chief diver is Bud Brigman played by Ed Harris a strong willed commander in the process of divorcing the designer of the drilling facility Lindsey Brigman played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio The antagonistic couple a team of four Navy SEALS and the divers go to the site of the downed sub But there is something else there an apparent intelligence perhaps alien perhaps indigenous that is watching the mission with marked curiosity The script of THE ABYSS shows definite James Cameron touches Cameron s films usually feature strong intelligent self reliant women and never more so than in THE ABYSS with its character of Lindsey Brigman The dialog is crisp but also very humanizing As usual Cameron s heroes are common blue collar types One of the virtues of a good science fiction film can be to make technology comprehensible THE ABYSS uses state of the art technology such as recently developed breathable fluid that will allow exploration of greater depths It also required new technology to be developed simply to allow the film to be made In this category are diving masks designed to let the camera see who is behind the mask but which coincidentally also allow a much wider field of vision for the divers than previously available Like BATMAN this film also had a large budget and was kept very much under wraps until its release BATMAN turned out to be a film that was visually fascinating but which short changed the story elements THE ABYSS is rumored to have a pricetag of 43 million and unlike in BATMAN there are no big name stars to soak up large pieces of the budget or rather there is one but it is the Atlantic Ocean and shooting underwater made the film much more complex to produce As with any major film that has been kept under wraps THE ABYSS has generated a certain amount of rumor One rumor on the positive side is that Hugo winning science fiction author Orson Scott Card participated strongly in the scripting He supposedly was on the set to ask the actors Ignoring the script what would you do in this plot situation The next morning the revised script would have the character doing just what the actor wanted And Card would add his own science fiction influence so that it is at least claimed that THE ABYSS ranks with THINGS TO COME and 2001 for the degree of participation of a science fiction author in determining plot A second and more negative rumor is that the life form was much better explained in the pre release and in Card s novelization but that the film was cut by 25 minutes down to 140 to make it more marketable In the cut the real logic of what is happening was considered to be the dispensable portion This is strongly rumored to be what happened to the film HIGHLANDER also from Twentieth Century Fox Cameron denies that any logic was cut from the film and says instead that where Card s book varies it is purely Card s invention But even as it stands THE ABYSS is one of the best science fiction film ever made This remains true in spite of a rather superficial treatment of the some of the science fiction elements It is very much a 2001 with all the slowish parts replaced by a good fast paced adventure film It is entertaining educational and exciting and has compelling albeit manipulative at times drama All it lacks is a sufficiently engaging concept Perhaps that was left on the cutting room floor perhaps not I would give it a high 3 on the 4 to 4 scale It could not do much better than that
0603,Abyss The,1989,Director James Cameron has a big reputation to live up to having helmed action classics like THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS and fans of his early works will certainly go to see THE ABYSS expecting something special Fortunately they ll get something close to a masterpiece certainly not the instant classic that the newspaper headlines blare at us but a good entertaining movie nonetheless The plot isn t super relevant as Cameron s eye is tilted more towards creating a sombre atmosphere and characterizations One unusual thing about the film is the way it opens you see the logo THE ABYSS with the tail on the y hanging down the camera zooms into the y and WHAM the film starts no credits no nothing This was a very effective technique because you find yourself plunged into Cameron s vision instantly and totally The underwater scenes are beautifully shot and they practically steal the film away much the way the gorgeous sets and camerawork stole the show from the lame script of BATMAN The characters which Cameron has confessed to making his number one priority in the film seem a bit flat when confronted with the billions of dollars of technology surrounding them although Ed Harris delivers a highly competent performance Michael Biehn did a commendable job at portraying a psycho military officer without any of the usual Hollywood over the edge cliches His performance was a masterwork of restraint if anything Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio on the other hand was annoying from frame one although this might be considered a success as her character was supposed to be a cast iron bitch Her softening at the end was predictable and not very well executed In fact the ending of the film in general was not very well executed Certainly the effects and camera work were up to par but the plot took a standard Hollywood nosedive Why is it that so few films are willing to take risks and show us a world where everyone doesn t live happily ever after Presumably the idealistic worldview is justified by studio management as being escapist entertainment with the rationale being that people go see movies to feel better about the world but implausibly saccharine endings such as the one in THE ABYSS leave this reviewer feeling much worse about the world Cameron may see THE ABYSS as a love story first but it seems as if he is more in love with the machinery of the film than the characters Still some viewers will find that desirable and the mastery of the film craft that Cameron shows will pay off for them Just ignore the hopelessly hokey ending and you ll have a good time
0604,Abyss The,1989,Given the skills of the Cameron Hurd team which has already brought us the memorable TERMINATOR and ALIENS it would be a shame to say that they let us down with their latest film THE ABYSS so it is pleasant to say that THE ABYSS is one of the more worthwhile films of the summer A nuclear submarine has a disastrous accident in the waters of the Atlantic the Navy sends a SEAL team to commandeer an undersea oil rig in the vicinity to perform if possible a rescue operation Of course nothing is goes right if it did would there be much of a story and everyone involved finds themselves in an ever widening predicament that tests their ability to survive I am told 45 million was spent on producing this picture Large budgets don t always translate into impressive productions sometimes they re the result of mismanagement but in this case the special effects are so spectacular that one wonders how they managed to do it for that small a sum This is fortunate because if THE ABYSS had to rest on the virtues of its story line it would most likely sink into a financial abyss even deeper than the watery canyon which threatens the heroes of this underwater epic While it is hard to be unkind to a team which has done their level best and then some to give the customers their money s worth not only is the production superlative but all the actors Ed Harris in particular put in good performances the script is alas almost as mechanical as the special effects resembling nothing so much as the kind of story Irwin Allen might tell on a good day it punches all the right buttons sometimes very effectively but never with enough subtlety to make the viewer fail to realize that his or her buttons are indeed being punched But I will not be cynical while this film does fail to reach the margins of greatness it is very definitely on the high side of good and I suspect there are some less jaded and finicky than myself who will be absolutely blown away by it As for myself I count myself satisfied My compliments to the chef
0605,Parenthood,1989,This originally appeared as two separate postings one in rec arts movies and one in soc women ecl I have mixed emotions about this movie So mixed that I have to look at this movie as entertainment and political statement Let me deal with the entertainment value of the film first and then the political ramifications As entertainment the movie was very good The pacing was generally excellent and Howard had good control over a very large and uniformly good cast I thought Martha Plimpton Steve Martin Jason Robards and the kid who played Kevin were all terrific I have mixed feelings about Dianne Wiest whom many people have singled out for praise She seemed too nice too accomodating to the rather strange whims of her son and daughter By the way I normally love Wiest and thought she was wonderful in PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO FOOTLOOSE and especially in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS This movie is so middle American that it takes place somewhere near St Louis Jason Robards is the father of four children Dianne Wiest Steve Martin Susan Which actress played her What movies has she been in and Tom Hulce Wiest is divorced with two children Martha Plimpton and Leaf Phoenix yes who else s brother would have a name like Leaf Martin is married to Mary Steenburgen and they have three young children including one Kevin who s been labelled as emotionally disturbed by his school Yes Kevin does tend to break into tears and wimp out easily but Susan is married to Rick Moranis and has a 3 year old that Moranis is training to be a child prodigy And Hulce is the prodigal son of the family and surprises his older siblings by appearing at a party with his young son The son was the offspring of an affair with a black woman who is currently on the run from the law which is why Hulce suddenly has him The movie has many good lines in it and a few outrageous sight gags One that stands out features Martin holding what he thinks is a flashlight after a brief power outage The children were very well cast and directed for the film One bad or over done performance would have been bad for the balance of the picture Anyway I do recommend this movie despite the fact that the excellent pacing fell to little pieces during the last ten minutes of the film and the fact that several characters make absolutely unvelievable transformations in incredibly short periods of time However I do have some major problems with the treatment of women in this movie which I ll go into detail in in another newsgroup One poster recently mentioned that she brought her school aged child to the film and thought the sex jokes went right over the kid s head Leslie picked up on almost every sex reference in the movie except for thank goodness the afore mentioned sight gag and tended to ask What do they mean only to have me respond Oh I ll try to explain it to you later Like when you re 12 This really isn t a good movie for a preadolescent Leslie thought the movie was very funny many of the other jokes can be comprehended by kids Aside from the fact we went to the movie to get out of the rain we were camping Acadia National Park this weekend so we saw the film in Bar Harbor s Carilion Theater a 1932 art deco movie house I was curious about Leslie s reactions to the children in the film She particularly enjoyed the overly taught child Hmmm Andd now for the political ramifications DISCLAIMER In a number of interviews the writers of this film have said they drew on their experiences as fathers to create the movie I don t think they deliberately intended to write a movie that so strongly promoted the old anatomy is destiny cliche But that s how much of the movie came off The theme of Parenthood appears to be threefold Children especiallly babies can make anything go right In this movie we are introduced to a number of families Gil Steve Martin a basically nice guy is still scarred by the way his father ignored him as a child and has a son who s severely oversensitive His older sister Dianne Wiest is a divroced woman coping with two teenagers one of whom marries VERY young and the other of whom is absolutely non communicative Their younger sister Susan is married to a man who s practically taken her out of the loop of parenthood by drilling their three year old in academia And their younger brother Tom Hulce is a charming ne re do well who arrives with a surprise son At the center of this group is Jason Robards their father who lavishes more attention on his antique car than on his wife or his grown children or his young grandchildren Yes he s messed up badly and even he admits that he wasn t such a hot father 1 Robards wife is practically a non entity in this movie She appears in many scenes but is given almost nothing to do This doesn t make lots of sense Since it was clearly established that Robards was a lousy father did she make up for it by being SuperMom Probably not She was extremely unassertive 2 The grandmother Robards mother in law was shifted around from house to house like a piece of kitchen equipment This lack of a permanent address seems to have no effect on a woman in her late 80s Now this woman was relatively sharp and even says that she likes life to be more like a roller coaster than like a merry go round Still 3 Susan lets her husband Nathan Rick Moranis walk over her to an enormous degree Her revenge During most of the movie it s eating junk food in the closet apparently not in the pattern of a bulimic but just in the pattern of a woman who can t get through to her spouse She finally leaves him After a few weeks he can t stand it anymore so this man who s always been so stodgy serenades her in front of her class He goes onto become a much more relaxed father when she goes back to him We surmise this because after almost 2 hours of him saying that kids need to be trained and playing was a waste of time he s shown making funny faces with his daughter 4 Dianne Wiest s daughter Martha Plimpton marries young and almost immediately becomes pregnant Wiest stressed early in the film how important college was and how bright this girl really was By the time she learns her daughter is pregnant she has completely stopped arguing with her other than to convince the young couple to stay together 5 This movie makes birth control out to be a joke Susan has sabotaged her diaphram something Nathan discovers after a routine check of it Gil is told he s going to be a father for the fourth time on the same day he s quit his job Abortion is briefly discussed but not considered an option since Gil s wife was opposed to having one by the way I m not advocating that any woman should be forced to have an abortion Since this movie is almost more fantasy than reality Gil gets his job back with a raise a few weeks later so his lack of income was only temporary By the end of the movie every couple in the movie who could have possibly had a baby either had a new baby or was pregnant I like kids but I found the simplistic attitude towards having them to be really offensive The teenagers were in no way ready to have a baby they couldn t even manage their own relationship Now it may sound like I really hated the movie Actually I really liked it THe performances are very good and while I found myself hating the plot the dialogue is pretty sharp There are many very funny moments in the movie But it bothered me too
0606,Karate Kid III The,1989,Capsule review It is not often that one feel s violated after watching a film but this movie managed to do just that When watching a sequels it is wise to lower your expectations before entering the theatre However the word expectation implies some positive value and nothing could have prepared us for the utter idiocy of this movie in all aspects Rating very low Actually this is not quite true The movie begins with a five minute montage from past films for those people who may not have seen the original These clips rekindle the simple heartwarming excitement of the first in this series However they make the rest of the movie all the more disappointing KARATE KID I may not have been a masterpiece but it had all the features which made it the summer sleeper it was Fresh faces sympathetic characters and a simple but exciting plot By the time these characters get around to this second sequel it is clear that not only they but also the writers have had enough Even Pat Morita whose presence lit up the screen in the original seems a caricature of his former self Actually the most likable character in this film in an odd sort of way is the archvillain named Silver the owner of dynatox a toxic waste dumping company which he has used to become extremely wealthy by issuing such orders as What do you mean they won t let you dump it Who in New Guinea even knows what chlorine is At least he is consistent No one else in this movie is The plot revolves around a familiar theme Ralph Macchio is forced to defend his all valley Karate championship by a vicious pack of kids egged on by Silver who is seeking revenge for his friend a former Cobra Kai Karate instructor who has been bested one too many times by the duo of Macchio and Morita For some unknown reason the main dynamic tension in the film is supposed to be provided by Morita s refusal to condone Ralph s re entry into the tournament as long as the only motivating factor is the protection of their lives and likelihoods Morita s philosophy is that Karate is only for self protection so there is a tiny contradiction here Somehow Morita s mind is changed when he finds out that the toxic dumper is sponsoring the return of the Cobra Kai dojos Somehow this is more serious than threat to life and limb and makes it okay for the kid to enter the Karate tournament You figure it out we couldn t One might hope that this movie could be saved by a love interest between Macchio and a young woman who works across the street from the Macchio Morita Bonsai shop No such luck The woman s character is completely without interest and the situations the two young people find themselves in are ludicrous Perhaps the producers wanted to keep a general rating so they managed to contrive a situation by which two young adults who are clearly attracted to each other can go out for several months without kissing We won t reveal the clever plot twist by which this is accomplished go to the movie if you re that desperate to find out Sitting in the movie we had to make a choice between walking out and waiting for the final fight scene surely they can at least get a fight to be interesting after all the practice But we waited in vain The fight scene is pitiful You would be better off leaving early and using the time to do something exciting like flossing your teeth This has been another summer of sequels GHOSTBUSTERS II FRIDAY THE 13TH PART N and now KARATE KID III Unfortunately moviemakers recognize that as bad as they choose to make a sequel if it follows on a blockbuster film unsuspecting theatregoers will fork out money to see it Perhaps like limiting the number of terms a U S President can serve congresses and legislatures should create laws limiting the number of sequels a movie can have Maybe this will be the only way to stop this growing tendency to forgo creativity in favour of a quick buck in filmmaking
0607,Lethal Weapon 2,1989,Okay Cinema Philosophy Time Can a film with an abysmal script unremarkable photography reams of shoot outs and chase scenes wind up villains outrageous plot blunders gratuitous advertising how many Subway Shops can you spot in this picture and a totally predictable climax be saved by a good rapport between the two main characters and a basis for said relationship that overshadows the pedestrian film I mean I like watching Gibson and Glover when they get together I particularly like the concept for their relationship Gibson plays a cop who is right on I mean right on the edge he s a finely honed somewhat demented at least in risk taking fighter However he would have burned himself out or killed himself long ago if it weren t for his friends i e his partner Danny Glover and his partner s family who ve adopted him and given him that lifeline that anchors him to reality Their affection for him and his for them works Unfortunately that constitutes about 15 of the movie The rest of it has to be one of the lamest excuses for an action film since FATAL BEAUTY Oh Lord where to start The villains are drug dealers sadists and racist South African officials I ll bet the head honcho was originally Joseph Goebbels Jr but they decided to cut that bit out to save running time for the action sequences What these people are able to get away with under the aegis of Diplomatic Immunity is unbelievable Even under the Bush administration Hell even under the Quayle administration Characters are introduced and then killed left and right to get G G and the audience into the Waste Their Ass mood it s pretty transparent And if that wasn t enough the main henchman comes out of the blue to say that he killed Gibson s character s wife before LETHAL WEAPON Gee why not have him responsible for shooting down Korean Airlines Flight 007 or spitting on Jesus really give Mel that excuse to Waste His Ass Good points besides the chemistry between The Guys Neat nail gun Craftsman The girl looks like Susan Dey with her own Wolfe tanning system And there are a few good lines Not enough to sustain the movie though My suggestion see THE ABYSS It isn t a masterpiece but I can still remember what happened in it LETHAL WEAPON II has sort of faded from my memory no doubt some sort of natural protection mechanism
0608,Abyss The,1989,THE ABYSS is an interesting flick and pretty entertaining it s also an interesting case study in that the entertainment comes much more from the surroundings than the plot The story works well enough nothing special buoyed mostly by earnest if non glowing performances by most of the cast it seems mired in molasses at times or maybe liquid oxygen The audience can breath it but they do it in gulps it doesn t flow well What does leave you with an impression and after time communicates more emotion than cast or dialogue really is the setting and the way the film was shot THE ABYSS takes place underwater WAY underwater and everything about the film gives that impression the technical details may be off but it feels right Cameron has without a doubt shot about the best underwater adventure film I can think of It gives when seen on a big screen preferably 70mm this film is not going to translate into video well folks a wonderful sense of claustrophobia of being under all that water And the deep dive ascents whew You stop thinking about what they re doing and just goggle at the spectacle of it all I think the idea to really shoot this underwater was a good one it adds to Suspension of Belief factor immeasurably I am curious how much of the underwater vehicle scenes were done with blue screen effects though perfect place for them Other good points liked the relationship between Harris and Mastrantonio though it never really flamed and was a touch too earnest And the early unknown entity bits were able to get me excited mainly due to Mastrantonio s acting Ed Harris shows that 1950s movie heroes can still muddle along in the 1990s Though I got this feeling right towards the end that he was going to say Ready to go 100 in the best John Glenn tones Finally I guess there s still some New Race Contact fascination left in me that wasn t totally sucked out by CLOSE ENCOUNTERS but the climax seems really visually derivative at points kept expecting Richard Dreyfuss to help Harris off with his helmet Hi Got any Cheetos Still it s a decent yarn at least by summer standards the look of the film is not to be missed though Find a 70mm theater this weekend and jump in
0610,Akira,1988,I feel like I should place a mountain of disclaimers before publishing a review of the latest imported dubbed Japanese animated film AKIRA First I ve been reading the serialized translated manga that the film is based on published by Epic Comics The story is considerably different it has to be considering the story is hundreds of pages long in the manga and has to be compressed and changed to fit into a couple of hours running time Secondly I like the way the manga story has been done so far and while most people seeing the movie will be viewing it with a fresh mind I was critically comparing it to it s printed incarnation That said I can recommend AKIRA the film only on its technical merits It is fantastic heart pounding animation giving you the kind of intense experience you find in ALIENS or DIE HARD Until you a start thinking about what s going on or b get to the conclusion which is some sort of mishmash about man the environment the universe and maybe God At any rate it s not very well explained The story deals with Tokyo in the early 21st Century A conflict in 1991 I believe destroyed almost all of Tokyo and since then the city has been rebuilding itself However underneath the newly constructed Olympic stadium a secret project with a dual purpose is taking place One part of the project is to examine and attempt to induce advanced mental powers in humans The other part is to imprison someone or something called Akira Into this situation stumbles two groups of people a group of anti government rebels headed by Ryo and Kay and a bunch of J D bikers headed by Kaneda and also his younger friend Tetsuo The escape of one of the mental psi subjects involves these two groups together along with covert government forces headed by The Colonel These characters become intertwined in a plot to either release contain or exploit the force known as Akira Katsuhiro Otomo the man who wrote and drew the manga AKIRA also wrote and supervised the film Some of the stories best parts are kept in the semi comic semi romantic relationship between Kaneda and Kay for instance Where the film really falls down is the nebulous reasons behind and explanation of what exactly AKIRA is how he got to be that way and what happens at the end of the film The manga explains things at least so far as it goes along with sufficient clarity but the film tends to give some great other worldly effects and let it go at that just because Kubrick got away with it in 2001 doesn t give everyone else Carte Blanche to use the Rorschach test ending as a fit conclusion for a science fiction movie It could be poor dubbing at fault but I suspect that the story from the manga was simply too involved to fit within the confines of a two point five hour film The animation however is spectacular and rather grisly having a weak stomach for this kind of thing I found myself a little queasy leaving the theater how my fellow netters could think of Wendy s was beyond me but for those who aren t anime aficionados I wouldn t recommend it
0611,Lethal Weapon 2,1989,In answer to someone s query Is LETHAL WEAPON II really as bad as that Starr guy says it is a few people have more or less recommended it the gist of their postings being that it was a lot like the first LETHAL WEAPON only more so so if you liked the first one you d like the second one Well I sort of liked LETHAL WEAPON back when I rented and watched it about a year ago It was kind of wahoo but what the hell the plot mostly held together and I liked the haunted desperate crazed and seriously depressed Riggs Mel Gibson and the contrast between him and the family man Murtaugh Danny Glover So why didn t I like nay why did I detest the sequel Lots of reasons most of which I won t go into here because a I want to keep this short and b in order to accurately categorize them I d have to see the damn movie over again and I m not getting paid enough for this to do that So the bottom line by the numbers I detested LETHAL WEAPON II because 1 Of all the major events in the movie virtually none of them could possibly have taken place in or near the City of Los Angeles the State of California the United States of America or the planet Earth in or near the year AD 1989 2 The creators writers producers etc of this movie could not possibly not have known that the alleged story they were filming was completely incoherent illogical ridiculous preposterous and a whole lot of other words too yet they went ahead and shot it not literally alas edited it made thousands of copies of it promoted it distributed it and then and this is the part that s gotten me angry they foisted it off on me and conned me into paying them six dollars and investing two hours of my life under the mistaken impression that I was going to be cinematically told a story 3 The bottom line and the reason I m so ripped about this is that the bastards ripped me off The promised me a movie a story told in moving pictures and sounds but all they gave me was a collection of about a hundred and fifty thousand pieces of 35mm celluloid spliced together and wound up on a reel And Special Bonus Point 4 Free With This Flame 4 The scum are getting away with it If this was some dumb who cares The Deathstalking Blademaster Vs The Lost Barbarian City of Glort Splert Part VII flick that shows up in the city s lowest grade theaters plays for about a week and then goes straight into the video market I wouldn t be so upset But this cinematic abortion is raking in money hand over fist professional critics who should know better are giving it thumbs up instead of reserving it a place on their Ten Worst Films of 1989 lists and the bastards who made this film and everyone else who s in the movie business for no reason other than the love of money are learning the Golden Lesson of LETHAL WEAPON II Throw enough flash and glitter and slo motion stuntwork and cardboard villains the scummier the better at the audience and they won t care whether it s garbage or not they ll just beg you to take their money away And the film industry will move another step away from quality and innovation and another step towards recycled garbage and Lowest Common Denominator movies and oh hell you ve already heard all this from people who really care about cinema from Siskel and Ebert on their good days and from Harlan Ellison who on his worst day can outwrite and outreview anyone in the business and from lots of others and none of it makes any difference when the Fakers and the Takers as opposed to the Makers crank up their magic publicity machines and start harvesting the money
0612,Millennium,1989,MILLENNIUM starts with an incredibly fake model of a Boeing 747 skipping the tops of clouds bumping all over the place We go to the cockpit where the crew is drawling ATC clearances and the captain for some reason so senile that he s taking orders from his first officer Inexplicably the airplane has a mid air with a DC 10 On the way down the flight engineer s sent to the back He returns as promptly shouting The passengers are all dead And thus is the crux of the story Kris Kristofferson plays the chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB You know he knows his stuff he looks unkempt walks like he has more aches and pains than James Gardner and growls out the smallest line When he smiles it looks like his face is going to collapse from the effort Clearly an expert As he investigates the crash he discovers various oddities watches that run backwards for example And a thing that manages to stun him Spoilers are at the end of this article The above makes the plot sound pretty interesting right Wrong This is a horrible movie The pits Pure un pretentious regurgitated crap The acting sucks The direction sucks The production values are non existent The special effects are laughable The dialog is lousy fake and contrived Technically the producers clearly haven t the foggiest idea of how the NTSB works Kristofferson to press conference We ll have our findings for you in a couple of days just hold your questions The thing which eventually gets Kristofferson in hot water with his bosses in Washington is SOP for the real NTSB Cheryl Ladd looks like a high school girl who s just discovered makeup Suffice it to say that this movie isn t worth seeing Five minutes into it I seriously debated running out and negotiating a ticket swap with The Package This movie is pure trash A zero rating out of four An utterly forgettable movie one which I am embarrassed to even admit having spent the time watching But even worse since about a quarter of the movie is run twice in the form of an alternative future flashback So we get to see the same horrible acting and implausible situations for 1 2 the running time of the movie In other words yes folks we finally have an SF flick this summer that s worse much much worse than STAR TREK V makes STV look like Academy Award material folks The whole point about the movie is that there s this sort of commando team from the future that runs about picking passengers off doomed airliners replacing them with dead bodies The idea s to seed them in the distance past or far off future A humanitarian effort right Well why do they even bother If the passengers are seeded in the far off future they re just fucking up someone else s future And seriously are airline crashes the most significant tragedy that people 1000 years in the future will be concerned about This is one hole the movie never overcomes Nor do they ever explain why life is such hell in the year 3000 Nor how the robot at the end is able to get all misty eyed and cry Now how these jokers are capable of producing dead bodies that are identical with other people without ever seeing the subject yet lack the technology to produce medicine I could go on and on about the incredible conceptual problems in this flick but it s simply not worth it
0613,Millennium,1989,MILLENNIUM is one of those film projects that seem to take forever to come to fruition then the fruit turns out to be a lemon I happen to like some lemons but they are not to everybody s taste Years ago there were rumors that somebody was going to base a film either on John Varley s novel MILLENNIUM or the short story the novel was expanded from Air Raid Well it came out finally based on the latter but named for the former Varley himself is credited with the screenwriting though it should be noted that screen credit is dubious As far as I know Varley has no experience screenwriting and the script is really very different from the short story And rather than the accomplished and creative story telling of a popular science fiction MILLENNIUM has more the feel of mediocre matinee science fiction films of the 1960s and in particular Ib Melchior s THE TIME TRAVELERS Minor spoilers follow but no worse than were in the coming attraction This downbeat science fiction film starts with a spectacular collision of two airliners and the resulting crash Enjoy the special effect It is the only one in the film both ambitious and convincing Bill Smith is the bland name of the even blander Federal agent sent to investigate the crash Smith is played by a bland Kris Kristofferson Smith runs into the chain smoking Louise Baltimore played by Cheryl Ladd Baltimore is not exactly what she seems to be Instead she is a visitor from a thousand years in the far future where she wears a punk hairdo distressingly like what you are already starting to see in New York City Baltimore is on a mission involving air disasters Just what she is doing is part of the mystery The script for MILLENNIUM needs some clarification There is an apparently unintentional ambiguity in the story telling The script clearly tries to clarify which interpretation is correct but does so inconclusively and unclearly With the exception of a few half hearted humorous moments the writing is all very downbeat and at the same time hokey The film s vision of the future is as hopeless as it is hopelessly unconvincing The film returns to 1960s science fiction film conventions such as having a convenient scientist along to explain the idea of the film Then there is an attempted love interest between two stars as animated as a Ken and Barbie doll and whose love is just about as interesting to the audience Some of the time paradox play does work some comes off as really stupid In short MILLENNIUM is easily better than some other adaptations of real science fiction stories films such as NIGHTFALL and NIGHTFLYERS but it is far from being a winner I rate it a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0614,Millennium,1989,There exist few examples of strong SF stories made into excellent films Three recent botches come to mind DUNE Frank Herbert NIGHTFLYERS George R R Martin and NIGHTFALL Isaac Asimov all based on stories of the highest caliber and all seriously flawed on screen Now comes MILLENNIUM based on the John Varley story Air Raid Hugo nominated I believe This is the only major SF movie I can remember where the script was written by the original author without being re written by several hacks And it is a major film unlike NIGHTFLYERS and NIGHTFALL both of which starred mostly unknowns running around cardboard sets Kris Kristofferson plays an air safety investigator who slowly comes to realize that there is something very odd about a plane crash Cheryl Ladd plays an assault team leader from a distant terrible future that is slowly dying To save humanity Ladd and her associates steal people from the past who are about to die in plane crashes away to a new life in a distant future one far beyond their own polluted world As a time travel story MILLENNIUM builds on the background provided by the simpler TERMINATOR and BACK TO THE FUTURE providing the audience an introduction to temporal censorship and time paradoxes Cheryl Ladd is surprisingly convincing as the woman from a dying world and Kris is believable as well The stewardesses from hell scenes as Louise and her team infiltrate a doomed 60 s era jetliner was the highpoint of the film for me I have several complaints however At one point Louise Baltimore Cheryl Ladd turns to one of her assault team and explains in true Gernsbackian Lecturese the concept of time censorship Louise s personal robot is simply a man in a tin woodsman suit The technology of Louise s future world seems more like that that of 100 years in the future than 1000 years in the future but this could be explained by a nuclear war or other disaster While driving to the movie I expressed a hope that the plot and script would be solid even if the FX were not the best While driving away I did an about face and claimed that the movie would be substantially improved if an extra million or so had been put into the robot and the final scenes which looked too much like the destruction of every citadel of evil I ve ever seen on film A final problem was the literary sounding voice over at the end of the film it might be a great story ending but a movie needs a visual ending Overall MILLENNIUM is a strong SF film an original SF film and a film that deserves but will probably not get a wide audience It is a complex story told from various temporal points of view that seemed to leave the audience I was with somewhat baffled I d rate it a 2 and with another million or two in FX and the re shooting of a couple of scenes it could easily have been a 3 film
0615,F.P.1,1933,I came out of a double feature at the Film Forum in New York City listening to the conversation of the couple behind me Boy I guess you really don t know how bad films were back then the man said I guess the comment really took me by surprise This was an evening I had been looking forward to for months and which had surpassed all expectations The evening started with a chapter from the serial BATMAN continued with DELUGE and concluded with F P 1 Each was a film I d wanted to see for years The fact that they did not stand up well compared to THE ABYSS is hardly relevant Each of these films is a missing piece of the puzzle of how science fiction films evolved When they find a new fossil at Olduvai they don t get excited because it came from a really terrific ape Of the great classic science fiction films that I have never seen I expect them all to be at best mediocre by today s standards Better than that is too much to hope for I frankly never expect to see a great 1930s science fiction film that I have not already seen The BATMAN serial was not actually from the 1930s but from 1943 and directed by Lambert Hillyer who had previously directed atmospheric chillers such as THE INVISIBLE RAY and DRACULA S DAUGHTER Lewis Wilson was the screen s first Batman succeeded by Robert Lowry and of course Adam West and Michael Keaton I have seen Michael Keaton sticking his chin out of his stiff probably plastic costume and he really looks like the comic character In 1943 Columbia did not have the same materials Wilson s Batman suit really does look like the long underwear it was probably made from There are wrinkles on the legs and the arms There is a pressed crease up the side of the legs The cowl has the bat ears but they are bent at the ends The effect is like a jester s cap and brought howls of laughter from the audience Robin had a full head of curly hair and a Halloween mask The only recognizable actor in the episode was J Carrol Naish as the evil Japanese mad scientist Dr Daka with a machine that turns men into zombies When Daka turns on his weird electrical equipment the entire theatre vibrates probably due to equipment left over from showing THE TINGLER earlier the same week It wasn t as visually impressive as the 1989 BATMAN but it was a lot more fun This was Chapter Five of BATMAN for the record Film number two was DELUGE directed in 1933 by Felix Feist then 23 years old He directed the 1953 DONOVAN S BRAIN and several episodes of television s VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA Here he was directing a screen version of the novel by S Fowler Wright It should be noted that DELUGE has long been thought to be a lost film and remains semi lost It has been just a couple of years since a copy turned up and it is dubbed in Italian For this showing a man at the back of the theatre translated The film opens by reminding us that God promised not to destroy the world by flood again and then after a buildup of nature going very sour proceeds to show most of the world being destroyed just the same way again We are told that the west coast has fallen into the ocean but never see it We do see New York City struck down by tidal waves and we see buildings crumble If the effects were believable they would be spectacular However even a contemporary reviewer complained that the effects were none too convincing My audience apparently agreed and jeered Now I like really credible effects They are a virtue But a reasonable attempt at effects is sufficient for me They are after all just a device to carry the plot When I go to a puppet show I do not complain that the puppets do not fool me into thinking they are real people Weak effects are quite forgivable as far as I am concerned if the rest of the film captures my interest And DELUGE is a very interesting film if not for anything intrinsic at least for where it fits historically What is particularly interesting is how the film reminds one of films that came after but not of films that came before After the holocaust is over and there are just a handful of people left the story has definite parallels to NO BLADE OF GRASS and the excellent British television series THE SURVIVORS Before the holocaust we have been introduced to iron jawed Martin Sidney Blackmer a family man who saves his family by moving them to a stone quarry but is somehow separated from them And we meet Claire an athletic swimmer The storm washes Claire to the doorstep of two criminals Claire becomes one vertex in a triangle that leads to the murder of one of the criminals Roger Corman would use almost the same plot for the 1960 LAST WOMAN ON EARTH Claire escapes the killer Jephson only to be found by Martin alone since the storm The two of them try to survive together However in the mean time a group of survivors has set up a small town They have thrown out some undesirables and the criminals pick Jephson as their leader He leads them on a raid against Martin and Claire At this point the film has sort of degenerated into a bad Western plot Surprisingly things do not work out well for all concerned and the film does at times touch on questions of whether bigamy is justifiable in a post holocaust world The story if crudely done but that didn t stop much of it from being redone often no better by other filmmakers A good film No But not a bad film either and definitely an important artifact Waiting for the film to start I started talking to someone sitting next to me who had just finished seeing F P 1 He assured me it really cornball with bad dialog I think I d like to thank him for lowering my expectations and making F P 1 such a pleasant surprise when my turn came to see it F P 1 1932 is an engineering film sort of a forerunner to THE TUNNEL and its remake THE TRANSATLANTIC TUNNEL and later THINGS TO COME Like the Tunnel films F P 1 concerns itself with engineering feats to aid transatlantic travel Instead of being about a tunnel it is about the building of a great floating airstrip and hotel to be built mid Atlantic the Floating Platform 1 F P 1 is really a German film refilmed in English to give it the trappings of a British film It is the story of engineer Captain Drost who designed the platform but could not sell it to anyone and his friend pilot Major Ellissen an enigmatic figure who arranges stunts to bring the platform to the attention of a shipyard then competes with Drost for the attentions of heiress Clare Lennartz Ellissen is played by a very dashing Conrad Veidt F P 1 is a spectacular melodrama of a great engineering feat and what goes into building it There is a subplot of a consortium dedicated to destroying the great platform for no readily apparent reason
0616,Casualties of War,1989,The structure of this film is largely in the form of a flash back which takes place in 1974 at the time of Nixon s resignation The flashback itself is based on an incident which took place in 1966 and was subsequently written up in New Yorker in 1969 The film is a somewhat different film compared to many of the plastic coated comedies light hearted dramas and big budget shoot them movies of most summer far This film tries to be an accounting of one event during the war I went to see this film because I as many curious wondered how Michael Fox would do in dramatic role I think he does well I did have the reservations that this was another Vietnam era film where by Vets would come out looking crazy or half deranged This being a problem with many of the films including PLATOON and COMING HOME Direction was provided by Brian DePalma I think the film does a reasonably good job It is not highly insane like the allegory of the DEER HUNTER or APOCALYPSE NOW On the other hand this wasn t quite Platoon or Full Metal Jacket The film does end on kind of an upbeat note definitely positive I would hope that vets haven t walked out of the theater by this time The investigation did take place and people brought to justice The film starts with Erickson Fox on a subway Nixon s resigning paper when a Vietnamese girl steps on the Muni SF He flashback sweaty The film goes to confusion of a night patrol and ambush Fox falls into a tunnel entrance and gets stuck I know some one who fell into a North Korean tunnel and survived This whole section is good We see Fox has a good Sargent The next day on a search during lunch The Sarge played by Penn is standing with one of his buddies when a sniper hits the buddy A short firefight ensues There is one scene when a VC jumps into a tunnel in sight a little improbable but it conveys the impression These guys don t trust the villagers The next assignment has them going on long range recon It is during this that Penn decides to abduct the girl A new grunt Diaz has no idea what s going on Is this usual They bring her along on the patrol where they rape her Diaz tells Erickson he won t go along but in the end does The argument with the Sarge is a moderately powerful statement of Going along much better than DEAD POET S SOCIETY The next day the patrol located a VC cache they call in an fire mission which also happens to waste a River Boat friendly fire It is during this that Erickson has a chance to free the girl unsuccessfully The Sarge decides to waste the girl at which time Erickson draws VC attention this is actually just prior to the fire mission This all takes place at once They end up shooting the girl After they return to their base Erickson just misses a fragging His officers won t listen to him only one buddy will His Lt breaks the squad up During another patrol Erickson and one buddy are talking when a new man who has been bugging them steps on a mine This is the moral climax of the film where he decides to tell He goes to the Capt Also no show I won t spoil the solution In the end an investigation locates the body of the girl the four are court martialed and the flashback ends with the Sarge whispering something into Erickson s ear Flash back ends Short interesting conclusion The film does have its holes and bad points one of Erickson s comrades is just a bit too homicidal and the officers perhaps a bit too don t rock the boat One does wonder what is whispered One does wonder if the Sarge is out in the world sentence is over by now Does he want pay back The film does portray combat well confusion waste the there one minute gone the next It is just one incident Fox does portray a character who is somewhat naive and goody two shoes I won t numerically rate it It is also hard to say you enjoy this type of film It s not clear how a viewer might place themselves if they would be an Erickson or a Sarge or even better a Diaz But it is a change from the lighter films of the summer There s no purely evil character They are all victims I do think the film is worth seeing
0617,Package The,1989,THE PACKAGE is one of the better political spy action movies I ve seen in a while Starring an impressive list of big name stars Gene Hackman Joanna Cassidy Tommy Lee Jones John Heard it manages to remain suspenseful throughout most of the movie without being overly predictable Some other films of this genre tend to be easily figured out within the first half hour of the film Army Master Sgt Gallagher Gene Hackman is called upon to transport a package Tommy Lee Jones from Germany back to the US for court martial The Package escapes in JFK airport which results in Hackman uncovering an international plot to short circuit world peace negotiations After enlisting the aid of his ex wife Lt Colonel Gallagher Joanna Cassidy and a Chicago police detective played by the same actor who played Lt Buntz on Hill Street Blues Geez he had the same suit same mannerisms even some of the same lines Talk about typecasting they are hot on the trail of Tommy Lee Jones The way in which The Evil Plot is presented is entirely believable There are quite probably some military types in both the US and Russian armies who would attempt something of this sort Even the spoken Russian is accurate something very few movies can lay claim to Gene Hackman plays well he plays Gene Hackman which is quite all right since most everyone expects a certain set of actions which Hackman is famous for The pacing is fine slowing down only a little when Joanna Cassidy is on screen My major gripe is that Joanna Cassidy is never quite believable as a full Lt Colonel It seems someone would need a lot of iron will and determination to achieve that rank and Cassidy with her high heels and hysterical screaming doesn t pull it off This film is rated R mainly for language and violence although the body count isn t high rating one pint o blood on the Joe Bob scale I would rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale mainly for lack of plot holes normally found in these movies Go see it
0618,Sex Lies and Videotape,1989,Capsule review An intense film about a cold sterile marriage that is put under pressure by the husband s mistress and by his college roommate who now makes a hobby of interviewing women about their sex lives An award winning film made on a shoestring budget Rating high 1 SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE is an independent production that could well be a hit like EASY RIDER was Both films were longer on style than on budget yet used their low budget to give the film a more authentic feel Just as the youth movement used EASY RIDER to define itself to itself yuppies may will find this film defining their feelings about sex for themselves At the core of the film are Ann and John Millany played by Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher They lead a sterile colorless life together each married to the other s image as a status symbol Neither has much passion or even affection for the other In very proper fashion Ann regularly sees a sterile colorless therapist with whom she discusses her sterile colorless sex life But John is seeing another woman on the side one who does not think of sex as if it were a spider that crawled into her house And Ann is puzzled by Graham played by James Spader an old friend of John s who now makes his hobby interviewing women privately about their sex lives This activity as a symptom of Graham s disturbance forms the psychological basis of the story SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE is an intense film about people with sexual problems It is more about attitudes and discussion about sex than it is about sex itself The film has a cold sexual tension that is mostly devoid of eroticism Viewers will leave having less of an urge to have sex than to talk about it In fact for better or worse the film is very likely to spawn a fad for amateur Kenseys all across the country to go out interviewing people about their sex lives First time writer and director Steven Soderbergh undoubtedly made a very hot commodity for a modest 1 2 million budget He creates not so much characters we have some feeling for as a set of walking case histories that are intriguing without being appealing The characters have a depth that saves what would otherwise be a very soap opera ish plot While I cannot say that detailed films about people s sex lives are really my cup of tea I would still rate SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE a high 1
0619,Dybuk,1937,Capsule review Paydirt A Yiddish film made in Poland in 1938 turns out to be a little known gem The film lacks a lot of what we might consider high production values but besides being an unintentional artifact of the culture of Eastern European Jewry wiped out in the Holocaust it also turns out to be a haunting horror film that deserves to be seen by all fans of 1920s and 1930s horror films At least one sequence a grotesque dance ranks this film up with some of the best of German Expressionism Rating 3 Watching the 1938 Polish made Yiddish film THE DYBBUK one is only too aware that the film is flawed Much of the acting is exaggerated as it would be in a silent film Some of the photography seems poor as well as some of the editing At least once the film cuts from a quiet scene to a loud scene and the sudden sound causes the audience to jump It is true however that in retrospect most of the faults seem hard to remember The strongest memories of the film are beautiful images some haunting and horrifying And while taken individually many of the scenes were less effective for me than they may have been for THE DYBBUK s intended audience this is a great mystical horror film perhaps one of the better horror films of the 1930s Spoilers follow though as with a Shakespeare play one does not see THE DYBBUK for plot surprises Sender and Nisn have been very close friends since their student days Now they see each other only on holidays To cement the bond of their friendship they vow that if their respective first children each expected soon are of opposite sexes then they will arrange a marriage of the two children Sure enough Sender has a daughter Leah though he loses his wife in childbirth Nisn has a son Khonnon though an accident claims Nisn s life before he can even see his new son or conclude his arrangement to marry Khonnon to Leah Years later Khonnon now a Talmudic scholar meets Leah and they fall in love Neither knows about the vow they would be married and Sender does not know whose son Khonnon is The intense Khonnon is already considering giving up his study of the Talmud to study Kabalah the great book of mystical knowledge and magic Sender three times tries to arrange a marriage with a rich but rather sheepish young man Twice the plans fail and Khonnon believes his magic has averted the arrangement The third time however an agreement is reached Khonnon calls upon dark forces to help him but is consumed by his own spell and found dead The day of Leah s marriage in fact during the marriage ceremony itself Khonnon s spirit returns from the grave as a dybbuk a possessing demon and takes over the body of the woman he was denied Leah is taken to a great and pious Rabbi now nearing the end of his life and torn with self doubts who alone may have the knowledge to remove the demon If some of this smacks of William Peter Blatty it should be remembered that this is a 1938 film based on a pre World War I play THE DYBBUK by S Anski a pen name for Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport along with THE GOLEM by H Leivick a pen name for Leivick Halper are perhaps the two best remembered and most commonly translated plays of the great Yiddish Theater While Yiddish folklore has many dybbuk and golem stories and the play THE GOLEM was based on an actual legend The Golem of Prague THE DYBBUK was an original story involving a legendary type of demon The film retells the story of the play but remains very different Other than plot there is not much of the play carried over into the film All too commonly constraints of budget and even what appears now to be inappropriate style rob some scenes of their effect Much of the acting is exaggerated in ways that might have been more appropriate to silent film or to the stage In fact in some ways this feels like an entire film done in a style much like the early good scenes of the 1930 DRACULA Director Michal Waszynski could well be excused on the grounds that he was making the film for a very different audience However just occasionally a scene will be really supremely well done The best sequence of the film is when Leah just before her marriage is called upon to dance with the poor of the town as is traditional Leah is reluctant and the dance turns into a grotesquery culminating with Leah dancing with a figure of death The film is a showcase for Yiddish songs cantorial singing and dancing both traditional and modern Much seems out of place but this one dance creates one of the most eerie and effective horror scenes of its decade THE DYBBUK stands as more than a good horror film It is also an artifact of pre Holocaust Yiddish film and of Eastern European Jewish village life Curiously for a Yiddish film some of the stereotypes that appear could be interpreted as being anti Semitic We see a miser with exaggerated Jewish features counting and recounting his coins We see what is intended to be a great Rabbi looking pompous fat sloppy and apparently lazy Why a Yiddish film would have such images is open to question Still it is a pity that this film is not better known It deserves to be thought of as a major film of its decade I rate it 3 on the 4 to 4 scale Congratulations to the National Center for Jewish Film for restoring this film THE DYBBUK will be playing at the Festival Theater in New York through September 28 Moderator
0621,Bao gio cho den thang muoi,1984,Synopsis A young woman living with her in laws tries to conceal the fact that her soldier husband was killed in the Vietnam war She has the local schoolmaster write counterfeit letters to the family presumably from her husband thereby concealing the news of his death The schoolmaster begins to fall in love with her and complications develop Vietnam English subtitles black and white 1984 90 minutes Director Writer Dang Nhat Minh A young woman journeys to the front presumably to visit her husband Instead she learns that he has been dead for nearly a year She decides to conceal the news from her in laws with whom she lives To carry out the deception the precise motivation for which is not made clear in the film the woman enlists the aid of the village school teacher who writes counterfeit letters to the family in the name of her dead husband The letters though phony have a strong emotional impact on her and make her long for her husband Meanwhile the school teacher is slowly falling in love with her and she starts to have feelings though restrained for him Their association in the small village they are living in results in gossip and problems when the local Communist Party officials investigate As a result of the Party investigation numerous complications arise and the story continues from there This film is clearly a melodrama as it deals primarily with the topics of grief family association and passion It could be considered to be a soap opera as it centers on the suffering of a young woman a very common theme in modern soap operas though it takes a very restrained approach to the emotions of the subjects Certainly restraint is not very common in modern soap operas Technically the film has some rather bothersome flaws At times the editing is very choppy Also there is a lot of dialogue that is not subtitled which of course makes it more difficult to understand if you don t speak Vietnamese Finally the photography is grainy at times Making a recommendation on this film is difficult In evaluating a melodrama the issue of emotional development and or attachment arises Do you feel for the characters Does the story hold your interest I didn t feel much for the characters though I found the story to be overall reasonably interesting The deception aspect was interesting however it was treated as an assumption of the story Instead the story centered on the less interesting aspects in my view grief and restrained passion between the two main characters Fans of melodrama may find the film to be of interest Remark this film is in limited distribution as part of The Vietnam Film Project a touring exhibition organized by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with assistance from The Asia Society New York and the East West Center Hawaii
0622,Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone The,1979,Synopsis A young Vietcong couple with their infant son live an idyllic life in a swamp They are relentlessly pursued by U S Air Force helicopters which they frequently hide from An amateurish propaganda film this stinker is so bad it s good Vietnam English subtitles black and white 1979 90 minutes Director Nguyen Hong Sen The film begins with scenes of the young couple climbing trees singing silly songs to each other that are a mixture of romance and propaganda We soon learn that they are Vietcong living with their infant son in a swamp an abandoned rice field the abandoned field of the title that is located in a free fire zone in the Mekong Delta There follows various scenes of domestic tranquility interspersed with scenes of the helicopters searching for them The couple seem to be skilled at hiding whenever the helicopters come near The man and his Vietcong comrades occasionally go on forays which seem to turn into exercises in group hiding The U S forces from aerial photos determine that there are people still living in the free fire zone They then set out to clear the zone of the Vietcong This sets the situation for a climactic battle between the Vietcong and the U S helicopters I was surprised and disappointed by the film The program notes described it as unnerving and compelling in its subjective camera eye view of war After seeing it I would describe it as alternately boring and laughable The film has very serious technical flaws Subtitles are frequently missing or displayed too fast too early or way too late The photography is out of focus far too often Also the infant steals the show in a number of scenes by staring at the camera and making faces This is natural for a baby but hasn t the Director ever heard of retakes Sarcasm alert perhaps the Director wants to emulate one shot Edward Wood Director of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE Should this be called PLAN 9 FROM VIETNAM Additionally much of the editing is choppy and severe Even worse in the major battle scenes the two opposing groups appear to be operating alone in separate areas and the film spliced together Needless to say the editing is very amateurish indeed Much of the dialogue is unrealistic some of it is quite ridiculous The portrayal of U S Air Force officers by Vietnamese actors is stereotypical thoroughly stupid unbelievable and unintentionally frequently funny The U S Air Force is portrayed as a bunch of drunken philandering deviants and cowards who shoot their helicopter guns at random The film is openly propagandistic in every way Such a film could be very offensive if cleverly done However this film is so ridiculous and poorly done that the only thing that might offend you is the film s own stupidity The audience frequently laughed at the film though probably not where the Director might expect laughter Overall evaluation gives PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE some competition in the worst film category Fans of trash movies might want to check it out Remark this film is in limited distribution as part of The Vietnam Film Project a touring exhibition organized by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with assistance from The Asia Society New York and the East West Center Hawaii
0623,Shirley Valentine,1989,Capsule review A promising and well written start leads to a rather bland romantic comedy in an exotic setting While Shirley is unhappy she is clever and endearing and funny Unfortunately her wish to visit Greece comes true and the story founders Rating 1 SHIRLEY VALENTINE is a film about a woman who started out to be remarkable lost her way and became very ordinary only to find herself and become remarkable again The film itself starts remarkable becomes ordinary but fails to become remarkable again The play upon which the film was based had just one woman on stage talking about her experiences but the film decides to be more cinematic and actually dramatizes the incidents At 42 Shirley is a mousy little housewife taken for granted by her working class husband and her two grown up but less than totally mature children We see her in her daily life of drudgery in which any deviance from her normal routine is seen by her family as rebellion She reminisces about her slightly wild youth and wonders how that adventuresome schoolgirl got buried in the routine of drudgery Deep inside she longs to go to Greece and sit by the sea sipping wine These early parts of the film set in England have a warm humor and good writing Finally Shirley gets her chance to go to Greece and the writing goes flat We have a tepid and predictable romantic comedy of her Greek fling There are still a few nice humorous scenes but not enough to compensate for the staleness of the material Pauline Collins is likable in the title role repeating the part she created on the London stage Ellen Burstyn played the same role in New York perhaps with not so thick an accent The play was by Willy Russell who wrote the film EDUCATING RITA That film s director Lewis Gilbert also directs this film Somehow EDUCATING RITA s paean to culture seemed like something that had to be said In spite of some clever writing in SHIRLEY VALENTINE Russell seems to be saying nothing less banal than You cannot please everyone so you have to please yourself For those who need that homily reinforced this film may seem profound My rating is a disappointing 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0624,Sea of Love,1989,SEA OF LOVE is a thriller that never seems to get into overdrive in spite of fine performances by the principals It s not a bad film indeed so much about it is good that it pales mainly in comparison with the film it could have been Al Pacino stars as a twenty year veteran detective investigating a series of execution style murders John Goodman joins him in a two man task force when the murders spread to his precinct Ellen Barkin plays of woman Pacino meets and falls in love with during the course of his investigation All three actors are proven reliable performers with lots of presence and they deliver I had some trouble buying Barkin s attraction to Pacino s character because he spends most of the movie in various states of drunkenness But Barkin s dangerous good looks are used to great advantage in this film and she does at least convince me that she falls deep in lust Whatever the quality of the chemistry there was a lot of it even if it was in an alcohol solution Goodman delivers his usual engaging and natural performance in his supporting role There are enjoyable aspects to the editing as we are spared some of the obligatory scenes one comes to expect in this genre The way the film jumps forward in time at just the right moments is refreshing The comic relief is well placed and springs naturally from the performances That s the good news Somehow SEA OF LOVE lacks the kind of edge needed in a thriller like this The surprise ending provides the desired shock but then leaves a disappointing after taste One thing that lured me to the theatre was the fact that SEA OF LOVE opened on three of the best screens in the Bay Area Must be pretty I thought The print I saw had some of the worst color timing I ve ever seen in a modern feature film The colors had a sickly green cast which could be the printer s fault but most of the lighting seemed rather un inspired which is no doubt the Director of Photography s fault The fact that I was thinking about things like the hair in the gate and the quality of the print is a good indication that I wasn t swallowed up in the tension That may be fine for some films but it s a real problem for a thriller If you re a fan of Pacino Barkin or Goodman or all three as in my case feel free to go enjoy their work If you want another experience like FATAL ATTRACTION or JAGGED EDGE save your money
0625,Sea of Love,1989,Capsule review Steamy love story crossed with a tepid police procedural mystery The plot may have been intended to be clever but fails somehow to have anything very unexpected There are problems in continuity casting and plotting Rating low 1 There is a serial killer in New York City Somebody seems to be answering all the rhyming ads men put in the personals columns and killing the men placing the ads Twenty year veteran police detective Frank Keller played by Al Pacino teams up with Sherman played by John Goodman Frank and Sherman decide that the fastest way to catch the killer is to place their own personals ad and plan rendezvous with the thirty or so women who respond to the ad By getting the fingerprints of each they hope to get a match with the fingerprints found at the scenes of the murders One woman who responds is the tall slim and sensuous Helen played by Ellen Barkin Frank fails to get Helen s fingerprints but runs into her again and they become lovers Now here is one failing of the plot Frank is ambivalent on finding out if Helen is connected with the murders but on those days he is curious he is willing to steal her Social Security card but not to take her fingerprints Frank is expert enough to recognize if two prints match but he never bothers to compare Pacino s character is one heck of a policeman He is an alcoholic he has a chip on his shoulder and he is a slob Even worse he garbles his lines so they are almost incomprehensible Barkin makes all the right moves to play a really sexy woman but somehow she never makes it all the way to actually being sexy Still her love scenes are sufficiently steamy to keep the audience staring closely at the screen Rounding out the cast is the now familiar John Goodman Goodman has a big St Bernardish look but is likable as the wise cracking partner Also on hand is William Hickey playing Pacino s father Hickey looks and talks like Pacino much more than some other actors who could have been cast in the role such as Jay Silverheels or Toshiro Mifune While this film has been likened by some to BODY HEAT the story is really just an okay police procedural about the catching of a killer While the dialogue is often quite funny particularly in the byplay of the two partners the script is overall just mediocre The plot is just not very clever or intricate and needs a few more twists to keep up audience interest I rate this one a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0626,Sea of Love,1989,Throughout the history of film great screen actors frequently appear in films that really aren t worthy of them Bogart Tracy Garbo Brando anyone you care to name really all appeared in films that not only were not great but clearly had no chance of being great from the word go Their scripts were unoriginal and average their directors were not top flight sometimes the production values weren t all that great But the classic film actors were always able to make such films worth watching despite the fact that the same film made with a perfectly competent actor in the role would have been just another piece of mediocrity Perhaps even more than their successes in strong roles great film actors can be defined by the interest they bring to lesser roles Al Pacino establishes that he is that kind of actor in SEA OF LOVE The script while acceptable is only a bit above average and of a genre we really see too much of today the police thriller Director Harold Becker has done a couple of good films but none that stand far out from the pack The entire film is reasonably well made the supporting cast gives a couple of strong performances but if it weren t for Pacino this film would be indistinguishable from any of a dozen other police thrillers released this year The script s central premise owes something to JAGGED EDGE instead of an attorney falling for a client who may be guilty of murder it s a cop falling for a suspect who may be guilty of murder with sexes reversed Pacino plays a twenty year man whose life is hollow and meaningless While investigating the murder of a couple of men who had advertised in a singles paper he finds himself increasingly attracted to a woman who may have answered their ads Is he really falling for a murderer His instincts are too ambivalent to trust evidence is present but weak and he has so far lost track of his center that he has no resources to fall back on While not fully original the central idea behind SEA OF LOVE has possibilities And having a woman as the suspect rather than a man adds another layer of complexity But the script does not play with the idea all that well The central attraction of the story is a man who loves a woman so much that he can t give her up even though he spends half his time expecting her to kill him But the film takes nearly an hour to introduce the woman and screenwriter Richard Price does not build up the suspense as well as he could have There are too few moments when the woman may suddenly pull out a gun and blow the hero away However Pacino takes over where Price leaves off Pacino is always best as a man under heavy pressure As Michael Corleone Pacino contained the pressure In DOG DAY AFTERNOON he let it explode Here he charts a middle course trying to keep it in but ultimately unable to hold it back While not up to the standard of these earlier performances Pacino demonstrates that he has lost none of his fire Pacino also does a nice job of differentiating this character from his previous parts this isn t just Michael Corleone as a disillusioned cop or Serpico as an alcoholic sellout Pacino fortunately has the advantage of good co stars to play off Ellen Barkin is a nice choice for the mystery woman Barkin s odd looks always suggest more beneath the surface than what shows and that is precisely the quality that this part demands Price has not gone quite far enough in drawing her character to make it completely successful but Barking does a good job of filling in the blanks John Goodman is strong in the only other major part in the film Pacino s partner Oddly his performance good as it is probably detracts more from the films intentions than it adds since his basic good humor and niceness undercut the suspense By offering Pacino s character a mechanism to release some of the steam Goodman also releases some of the film s tension Price has not constructed his screenplay as well as he could have but his dialog is excellent excepting only the final scene That scene lacks the snap necessary to provide a satisfactory wrapup to the story If Price had any really great lines saved up for a rainy day this scene was the place to use them This deficiency is partially compensated by a few sharp observations that Price manages to fit in around the edges of the story His plot plays the police thriller game fairly but is not sufficiently clever to stand out Harold Becker proves to be a reasonable choice for the director He does particularly well at capturing Pacino s performance He succeeds in providing a few tense moments and keeps up the mood well Becker also does nicely in shading in some minor characters who were probably only vague suggestions in the script On the whole his direction is unobtrusive One can imagine that Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet could have done much more but Price does enough The technical credits also are fairly average SEA OF LOVE is worth seeing for those who like the genre or those who like Pacino The various elements of the film are at least average and Pacino s performance raises the overall effort to a higher level SEA OF LOVE may never be remembered as a great film but twenty years from now it s likely to be regarded as a nice minor film of a great actor
0627,Water and Power,1989,Synopsis A fusion of nature and city images interwoven with special effects created by optical printing animation and time lapse photography Sort of a special effects KOYAANISQATSI but different in tone and style This non narrative film evolved over a period of approximately ten years it was not planned The creator of this unique film Pat O Neill is a Los Angeles based filmmaker specializing in special effects especially optical printing used extensively in this film The film consists of sequences of images nature city and people Most of the nature scenes were filmed in Mono County California where there is a large lake that was drained by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power source of the title of the film The city scenes are from Los Angeles and include time lapse scenes as used in KOYAANISQATSI Many of the people scenes were staged for the film Interspersed among the images are stories some of which you read others you hear and some are acted out Optical printing is used to overlay one image on another one story on another Animation and computer graphics are also used and are interfaced with optically printed images for some interesting and striking effects Much of the filming was done with a computer controlled camera animation style in the words of the Director This has a number of side effects Some scenes are really striking others are so fast as to nearly overwhelm the viewer Some of the stories and some of the animation reflect a subtle sense of humor The film also includes in optical printing overlays sections of old silent films It s strange but somehow they don t seem out of place amidst all the special effects Despite the lack of a narrative the film holds your interest well It s all a bit weird and non commercial but worth seeing if you have any interest in special effects Also if you liked KOYAANISQATSI or CHRONOS two non narrative films you will probably find this to be interesting Distribution This film is currently in its world theatrical premiere Next theatrical showing is 9 21 at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco It has been selected for the New York Film Festival next month and the Berlin Film Festival Feb 1990
0628,Package The,1989,Capsule review Fast paced if not entirely satisfying political thriller has Gene Hackman on the run from the Army and the police trying to avert the sabotage of a nuclear disarmament treaty Very reminiscent of other thrillers especially SEVEN DAYS IN MAY but with a few new wrinkles of its own Rating low 2 THE PACKAGE is a neat little political thriller with a complex but still fairly coherent plot The story is reminiscent of some of the better political thrillers from the early 1960s though most of all and perhaps too closely it parallels the plot of SEVEN DAYS IN MAY THE PACKAGE is however not as cerebral a thriller as is SEVEN DAYS IN MAY having less discussion of the political reasons for what is going on and substituting instead action and car chases That choice makes the film more entertaining on one level but less involving on a deeper level While in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY we are led to conclude that the real enemy is an age in THE PACKAGE there is little doubt that the real enemy is a group of bad guys whose motives are all too quickly glossed over That is just not as satisfying The story begins at a disarmament summit meeting in East Berlin at which United States and Soviet diplomats agree to disarm and cooperate with each other However a dissenting group of high ranking United States and Soviet military people decide they do not want to cooperate with each other so they team up to sink the treaty so they can go back to distrusting each other Now that I think about it that does seem a bit ironic Into this situation is dropped Johnny Gallagher played by Gene Hackman Gallagher is a career military man who becomes a cat s paw for the conspirators Also on hand is Tommy Lee Jones as a brawling soldier whom Gallagher must escort back to the United States and who clearly is not quite what he seems to be It is not long before Gallagher is on the run from the army the police and the conspirators He enlists the aid of his ex wife Eileen Gallagher played by Johanna Cassidy also a career army officer It is extremely refreshing incidentally to see an intelligent action character played by a woman over 40 As political thrillers go THE PACKAGE has a complex plot involving a wide spectrum of characters from the intelligence community to Communists to neo Nazis While the ultimate goal of the conspirators is not hard to guess many of the details of their plot are unexpected enough to keep the viewer off balance and guessing I give it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0629,In Country,1989,Some novels make good films Some novels don t One good predictor of whether a novel will make a good film is how much the novel depends on the inward lives of its characters DAVID COPPERFIELD full of incident and activity could make a good film So could GONE WITH THE WIND or THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER or TAIPAN As the last example shows just because it could make a good film doesn t mean it will ULYSSES in which the inward voice of the author and the details of the central character make the trivial heroic probably could not make a good film Neither would CATCHER IN THE RYE THE SOUND AND THE FURY or ALICE ADAMS Again the latter example shows that there are exceptions IN COUNTRY was obviously based on a very interior novel Things happen but most of them aren t terribly dramatic So expecting the film to be completely successful is asking too much What s heartening about IN COUNTRY is that parts of it work very well IN COUNTRY concerns a Kentucky girl who has just graduated from high school Gradually her father who died in Vietnam comes to be more and more important in her life She must undergo a difficult painful growth before finding the right place in her heart for him At the same time her uncle an embittered veteran wastes his life because he cannot escape the pain of his experiences I ll bet this read very very well It films only moderately well and only because some very talented people have done superb work Foremost is Emily Lloyd as the girl Lloyd an English actress whose first film WISH YOU WERE HERE demonstrated her ample promise here succeeds in an entirely different type of part Working behind a flawless Kentucky accent at least to my untutored ear she portrays a nice ordinary girl who finds that her normalcy is undermined by her father s experiences in Vietnam even though she never met him Lloyd ably shapes the character of a typical American teenager discovering that there is more to the world than her first car her boyfriend and going to the shopping mall Bruce Willis does a nice job as her Uncle Emmett Willis was a bold choice since his previous film roles do not suggest depth However he willingly buries himself in the character No wiseacre smirks at the camera no smugly hip attitudes just an honest and successful attempt to build a character around his gifts His performance demonstrates that he is an actor with more use than carrying DIE HARD II Unfortunately the combination of performance script and direction fail to lift Emmett above the role of plot functionary He has reality but he lives in the background Any problems with IN COUNTRY have nothing to do with the acting The problems are in the script and before that probably in the whole idea of making a film from the book IN COUNTRY is filled with modern novelistic digressions It perpetually wanders from its central theme In the novel these digressions were probably seamlessly integrated into the experiences of the central character enriching the reader s understanding of her growth Writers Frank Pierson and Cynthia Cidre and director Norman Jewison fail to blend them into the story They are drags on the film which around the hour and a half mark begins to feel drawn out Fortunately Pierson Cidre and Jewison are able to finish very strong Bobbie Ann Mason s novel gave them one perfect cinematic scene to work with and they make that sequence play extremely well The final scenes are highly moving and redeem the slowness of the earlier film Jewison has plenty of good cinematic credits including literary adaptations such as IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT He does well with IN COUNTRY but there are two potential problems with his choice as a director First he is Canadian and the heart of the story is how the Vietnam War has affected even those Americans who weren t born at the time Second it is a girl s story not a boy s Jewison manages to imagine his way past the first problem but not entirely past the second IN COUNTRY seems an authentically American experience but not completely a female one We ve seen a lot of films in the last ten years that sensitively present boys stories but not nearly as many that have a girl as the central character Part of the reason is that most writers and directors are male They identify with the male experience and understand it To make a good film about a woman they must rely on imagination always in short supply in Hollywood Jewison successfully imagines himself a U S citizen but not a young woman As a result the film looks at its central character from outside despite the fact that the story is presented through her eyes That Lloyd s character is not totally a cipher is due to her talent and perhaps the contribution of Cynthia Cidre to the script Jewison must also bear primary responsibility for the lugubrious pacing of IN COUNTRY The supporting cast is good with Peggy Rea as Lloyd s grandmother a standout Judith Ivey also does well with relatively few scenes playing Emmett s old girlfriend who wants him back Kevin Anderson mostly drives a car in a somewhat dispensable role as Lloyd s boyfriend The technical credits are high quality Hollywood professionalism which is the best film professionalism in the world Not brilliant not inspired but very competent and well executed James Horner s rather routine score fills a similar bill supplemented by several rock songs especially an overused and somewhat inappropriate Bruce Springsteen number No one in this film is any hotter than a low smouldering much less on fire IN COUNTRY is another of those praiseworthy Hollywood films Everyone had good intentions everyone did a good job some people even did a great job But it is only moderately successful none the less with none of the snap and heat of a really strong film The ending is so surefire and so well executed that it overcomes many of the rather routine aspects of the rest of the film It makes the film worth seeing especially when coupled with Emily Lloyd s performance
0630,Li gui chan juan,1989,Synopsis A Chinese ghost story set in present day Hong Kong and Taiwan A modern dance choreographer is possessed by the ghost of a woman who was murdered Thus possessed she stalks and takes vengeance on the murderers Good film much better than most films in this genre but nothing special Taiwan English subtitles color 1989 98 minutes Director Writer Fred Tan Ghost stories are fairly common in Chinese cinema and range from low budget kung fu films to sophisticated melodramas and mysteries This film with its large cast special effects and large budget is fairly representative of the better films in this genre It is very well made with high production values The plot is relatively simple A beautiful young woman is brutally murdered by her boyfriend and his accomplices They trap her in a car which is then set on fire so she is burned alive and conscious The precise reasons for this are not made clear but black magic rituals are involved During the ritual mistakes are made which allow the murdered woman s soul to escape as a ghost into this world She possesses another young woman a modern dance choreographer who recently attempted suicide as the result of a failed love affair After possessing the choreographer she sets out for brutal vengeance on her former lover and his accomplices I won t say anything more about the rest of the movie to avoid spoilers other than to say that there is an interesting exorcism scene The exorcism scene may set a new standard in special effects quality but not in imagination for movies of this type Unlike many ghost stories there is very little humor in this film The humor that is present is mostly satire of other Chinese ghost films if you have never seen such a film you might not appreciate the very subtle humor It s also very black humor as the funniest scenes are the murders This is the third film by director Fred Tan Like his first two films described below it paints a bleak view of women and their role in society Women are usually shown as victims in his films but victims by choice This outlook has made his films very controversial some hate his films for this reason others like them for the same reason At the least they are very thought provoking and worth considering for this reason Distribution Currently in its U S theatrical premiere this film is being screened at a limited number of art houses It is being shown along with two earlier films by the same director ROUGE OF THE NORTH a cold melodrama set in 1910 Shanghai a young woman accepts an arranged marriage only to learn on her wedding night that her groom is a blind invalid asthmatic as time goes on she becomes evil and bitter and DARK NIGHT an erotic psychological thriller a woman trapped in a marriage to a husband that neglects her seeks out a lover only to find that her lover is as bad as her husband thus she ends up being enslaved by two men instead of just one
0632,Thi Tran Yen Tinh,1986,Synopsis On the way to a wedding in a rural area an important government official a Minister is injured when his car hits a slow moving wagon However all the passengers of the car are unconscious which one is the Minister Two counties vie for the honor of giving medical treatment to such an important official and a comedy of errors ensues An extremely funny satire of the bureaucracy that controls the smallest details of life in Vietnam Vietnam English subtitles black and white 1986 90 minutes Director Le Duc Tien It is a Sunday an important wedding is to take place in a rural county in Vietnam The bride is related to the previous County Communist Party Committee Chairman and the groom is related to the present County Party Chairman An important government Minister has been invited to the festivities he is coming by car from Hanoi Enroute his car has an accident and all persons are thrown out of the car in the accident Two ambulances arrive one from each of two neighboring and rival counties They remove the injured to their respective County Medical Clinics From here on action is centered in one of the Counties It turns out that Government regulations prevent the Clinic from operating on their patient their facilities are not the correct class Ministers being high officials in the classless socialist society that Vietnam is receive by law a much higher class of medical service than do the ordinary peasants The previous and present County Party Chairs seize the opportunity to try to save the Minister They plot and scheme to try to coerce the Director of the County Clinic into operating on the Minister thereby saving him They want to exploit the affair to promote their County and also gain favors with corrupt Hanoi officials Meanwhile the young bride waits for her groom to appear However he is busy helping the current County Party Chairman with his plans for the Minister The crazy farce continues with many interesting twists All in all this is an excellent film and a biting satire of the corruption and mindless bureaucracy that controls the smallest details of life in Vietnam There is an interesting scene where two men who have just been discharged from the Medical Clinic are complaining that they are still sick As they walk out they encounter the Clinic s ambulance driver who explains that the Clinic meets its production quota for diagnoses and treatments by discharging and readmitting the same patient multiple times He then reassures the men that they are surely good for at least 3 discharges and readmissions he tells them to come back the next day It is a very pleasant surprise that such a wickedly funny satire with a decided anti government slant was made in Vietnam As such this is one of the first examples of liberalization in Vietnamese cinema Compared to the two Vietnamese films previously reviewed WHEN THE TENTH MONTH COMES THE ABANDONED FIELD this film is vastly superior Overall an excellent film definitely worth seeing Distribution This film is in limited distribution as part of The Vietnam Film Project a touring exhibition organized by the UCLA Film and Television Archive with assistance from The Asia Society New York and the East West Center Hawaii
0634,Black Rain,1989,I ve always had ambivalent feelings about Ridley Scott s movies they always seem to be more style than substance but then again they usually have a LOT of style As another critic said of BLADE RUNNER The package is so pretty that you don t really care there s nothing inside And so it is with his latest effort BLACK RAIN In this film Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin a tough and abrasive NYC cop who is under suspicion of having skimmed off some of the loot confiscated in drug busts By chance he happens two witness a pair of murders he captures the murderer who turns out to be a Japanese Yakuza gangster who is wanted in Japan The Japanese request extradition and Conklin and his partner take the gangster back to Japan where they are immediately bamboozled by fake Japanese police who spirit the gangster away Humiliated Conklin sets out to recapture the gangster Okay except for the Japanese element this sounds pretty much like a standard cop flick and that s precisely what it is The story line has an indifferent predictability and the dialogue in places is so hackneyed that it s embarrassing particularly as the movie evolves into the classic buddy cop scenario as the bad mannered Conklin develops a rapport with a tight assed Japanese cop The movie tries to draw strength from culture clash but unfortunately while I have little doubt that technically its depiction of Japan is correct the Japanese seem not to be humans that you can understand like or hate but simply latter day oriental stereotypes that may not be as offensive as those of WWII propaganda films but aren t any more interesting I have to admit however that it might prove difficult to give any depth to characters in the short time of a movie when the cultural barriers are so high Then again all the American characters hardly seem to have much more dimension If all this nitpicking makes BLACK RAIN sound like a terrible film forgive me since it would be a gross exaggeration to say it was In some scenes Scott demonstrates that sharp sense of cinematic style that is the saving grace of his pictures his depiction of Japan at night are BLADE RUNNER for real showing off his ability to turn reality into science fiction I would say that your expectations should be set properly BLACK RAIN is nothing extraordinary but it is reasonable light entertainment if you are in need of such
0635,V gorakh moye serdtse,1967,Synopsis A tribute to silent movies this 1967 Soviet film silent except for sparse Russian narration has the look and feel of a 1920s era silent film Very creative and visually inventive Should interest fans of silent films U S S R Russian voice over no subtitles black and white 1967 40 minutes Director Rustam Hamdamov Perhaps I should start off by saying that I am not a real fan of silent films and have seen only a few of them However one of my favorite films is KOYAANISQATSI a modern film with no dialogue Thus at least I appreciate the fact that spoken dialogue is not a strict requirement in films The story here concerns a young boy Scarecrow and his family his father the poet and his mother a great woman who has great difficulty fitting into her corset One day a famous actor comes by for lunch which initiates a sequence of interesting and visually inventive images and events Examples of the visual inventiveness here include scenes shot from a high vertical angle so we are looking down on the actors and interfacing close ups of oil paintings with live action shots similar to current usages of matte paintings in special effects shots The overall effect of these images is to satirize the characters Although made in 1967 the film very much looks like it was done in the 1920s The film is grainy in poor focus at times The acting body and facial gestures are exaggerated as is the silent movie style The costumes and props are from the 1920s or before The text screens look like they were copied from some old silent science fiction film Because silent films are not popular nowadays I cannot recommend this film for a general audience However fans of silent films may find it of interest Distribution The print source was Goskino it appears that current distribution is very limited
0636,Vecher na kanune Ivana Kupaly,1968,Synopsis A poor peasant makes a pact with an evil spirit to gain possession of the beautiful daughter of a rich man Although based on a folk tale the film s treatment of the story is quite unusual being a fast paced sequence of surrealistic imaginative and often weird images Very strange indeed U S S R English subtitles color 1968 shelved by Soviet censors until 1988 when it was finally released 71 minutes Director Writer Yuri Ilyenko This film is based on peasant mythology but it is not like any folk tale In particular it is not corny and there is very little singing or dancing in it Instead the film proceeds as a fast paced sequence of events and images The story is loose at times and the action so fast and symbology so obscure that it is difficult to follow the story at times The images depicted include some that are surrealistic indeed some are self consciously so some that are very beautiful and many that are just plain weird Just a few of them include a couple riding a large hog to which they have attached a saddle cows painted light blue in a field crayfish crawling around with lighted candles on their backs In one scene the people are standing at a 45 degree angle in another the young couple are floating in air horizontally The plot is fairly simple and is set in old pre revolution Russia A rich man agrees to give away via marriage his beautiful daughter to an friend of his However the girl and a young peasant are in love Preparations for the wedding are underway when the young man makes a pact with an evil spirit for the woman he loves The evil spirit will help him gain the woman he loves by making him incredibly rich provided the man performs a ritual sacrifice of a young child Initially the man resists the request Finally he performs the deed However when his sword strikes the child the child is turned immediately into a tree bearing gold coins The remainder of the film deals with the subject of greed both from a pagan and religious Christian viewpoint There is extensive religious symbology in the film and this may be the reason it was shelved by the Soviet censors Of course they may have shelved it simply because it s so weird I don t know their reasons Besides censorship for any reason is bad The film does have some humor in it mostly slapstick reminiscent of the Three Stooges but not as physical The combination of slapstick humor with surrealism is very unusual Overall this film is so strange that I would not recommend it for general audiences However the film is worth considering if you are into surrealism Distribution Currently in limited distribution as part of The Cutting Edge a touring set of six films that have received international acclaim but are considered too risky for general commercial release Presented by the International Film Circuit
0637,Johnny Handsome,1989,John Sedley is going to get a second chance at life Mickey Rourke plays John Sedley who was born with massive cranial deformities known as lionheadedness In spite of Sedley having a good mind his life has been a sequence of rejections scrapes with the law and foul ups Most recently he was involved in a heist in which two of his partners Sunny Boyd and Rafe Garrett played by Ellen Barkin and Lance Henriksen murdered John s best friend made off with the takings and left John to take the rap Then as an added stroke of viciousness they try to have him killed in prison But the prison doctors want to give John a new name and a new much improved face He can take his new life or he can go back to his old life His surgeon thinks he will go for the new life Drones the cynical police detective played by Morgan Freeman is convinced that John s unfinished business will just be too strong an attraction Want to know which he does Well director Walter Hill is known for violent action pictures such as 48 HOURS and RED HEAT Hill seems to specialize in stories about particularly sadistic criminals and likes to create killers for whom simple killing seems too light a punishment And Boyd and Garrett are no exceptions Hill brings Rourke back to New Orleans the site of Rourke s popular ANGEL HEART although the New Orleans atmosphere is almost ignored in JOHNNY HANDSOME indicating that Hill is nowhere the stylist that Alan Parker director of ANGEL HEART is To Hill s credit however he does get some atmosphere by subduing the color of the film In spite of what Ebert and Siskel say a good stylist really can create a bleaker feel in a scene with color than with monochrome It is just easier to create a mood in monochrome JOHNNY HANDSOME does not have a particularly original plot Basically the same story was told 53 years earlier in THE MAN WHO LIVED TWICE For that matter both are really at heart THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO But JOHNNY HANDSOME is a better made film than most of Hill s other chase films The mere fact that one particularly obnoxious woman in my audience irately complained because it did not have the ending she expected indicates that Hill is doing something right I give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0638,In Country,1989,In the American film industry lifting a taboo is like opening a floodgate Sex was a taboo for a long time so was very graphic violence Neither seems to be a particularly scarce commodity in current films Another subject that filmmakers felt they had to stay away from for a long time was the Vietnam war The assumption was that films about an unpopular war would probably be unpopular also Right into the mid 1980s the film industry was still making more films about World War II than it was about Vietnam But now there seems to be at least three or four major films a year about the Vietnam war and if after effects Many are thoughtfully and intelligently made Presently running there is both Brian DePalma s CASUALTIES OF WAR and Norman Jewison s IN COUNTRY The latter has gotten quite a bit of favorable comment IN COUNTRY is the story of Samantha Hughes played by Emily Lloyd who in the summer following her high school graduation begins asking questions about her father s death in the war Samantha lives in the small town of Hopewell Kentucky in amongst several Vietnam veterans all of whom are haunted by their war memories and who in fact seem to be constantly living in the shadow of the war Samantha is spending the summer with her uncle Emmett Smith played very convincingly by Bruce Willis in one of his rare serious roles The climax and culmination of her summer and the film is her visit with her uncle and her grandmother to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC What makes IN COUNTRY remarkable among all the respected Vietnam war related films is how little understanding it really does bring The story is diluted by subplots of Samantha s and her girl friend s romantic attachments and more time is spent with an old girlfriend of Emmett s going after him again The latter plot is tangentially related to the war theme since Emmett is still too disturbed to relate well to anybody But snippet flashbacks of Emmett s war experiences are just a bit too simple and pat The scenes at the Memorial are moving which is to say manipulative but in a good cause and clearly what the entire film is aiming for However there is nothing in the scene that brings us closer to the war experience Like the Memorial itself the film brings not so much understanding for the war veteran as a tribute to the veteran That is not so ambitious a goal but it is sufficient I give the film a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0639,How to Get Ahead in Advertising,1989,Note the Cartoon Laws posted here recently were apparently taken in large part from O Donnell s Laws of Cartoon Motion in the June 1980 issue of ESQUIRE magazine a fact that the original poster didn t mention and may not have known these things tend to travel from person to person Moderator Contains some profanity minor violence minor gore and brief nonsuggestive nudity Overall rating 3 5 on the 0 4 scale At the outset let me confess that I m in the process of starting postgraduate studies in Advertising so perhaps this film is a little bit more poignant to me than to general audiences Nonetheless I feel that the wit of Mr Robinson s latest effort are enough to make this film very attractive to anyone living in the ad addicted 20th Century HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING is the tale of Bagley an advertising whiz kid who is driven to distraction by his inability to come up with a slogan for pimple cream As Bagley s derangement progresses we learn that the true source of his anxiety is a deep seated misgiving about the ethics of the entire advertising profession The malady that arises causes no end of hilarious situations forgive me if I m too vague but it s difficult to explicate the rich humor of the film without giving the plot away All I ll say is that the title is a terrible pun Grant turns in an outstanding performance as the manically panicing Bagley Ward does an acceptable job as his wife and Wilson delightfully grates as Bagley s old boy boss Technically the film is fairly low key The special effects are good without being attention drawing or technically outstanding Camera editing technique is standard fare The pace is good this one won t put anyone to sleep The script is consistently witty never slowing down for a second it even features a brief poke at the Blake fans in the audience
0640,Tales from the Gimli Hospital,1988,Synopsis Set in the distant past in Gimli an imaginary Icelandic fishing village this is the story of Einar the Lonely a fisherman who gets sick in an epidemic and must stay in a very strange hospital to recover Very similar to ERASERHEAD in style destined to become a cult film Canada black and white 1988 66 minutes Director Writer Guy Maddin The story begins in modern Gimli Two children visit their mother who is very sick in the hospital It turns out that the mother spends her time in the hospital listening to strange electronic music Since the mother is indisposed the nurse takes the children aside and tells them the story of Einar the Lonely which we viewers see as a reenactment As the story of Einar begins we see vignettes of life in Gimli where people wash their faces with straw and squeeze oil from live fish after which the fish oil is used as hair cream As you can tell Gimli is a very strange place One day Einar gets sick an epidemic is sweeping Gimli He is then admitted to the hospital Continuing with the strangeness we see the hospital treatments for the epidemic rubbing dead seagulls over the sores and ritual bloodlettings done with the point of a large sickle Einar slowly recovers and tries to make friends with the voluptuous nurses in the hospital He makes friends with the man in the bed next to his and the very strange story of this man is told in flashbacks As it turns out Einar has through his gross perversion committed a great wrong against this man This is revealed and the story continues from there The style of this film is very similar to the cult film ERASERHEAD It was filmed in black and white mostly black and appears to have been done on a very low budget The photography ranges from soft focus scenes reminiscent of the very best black and white films of the 1930s and 1940s to blurry scenes that look like somebody s home movie Despite the low budget the Director succeeds in creating a whole new world the hospital in Gimli just as David Lynch succeeded in doing in ERASERHEAD The Director of this film Guy Maddin shows considerable imagination here though it is a very warped imagination There is plenty of humor in the film and of course it is a very warped kind of humor Most of the humor is derived from the strange customs and the way things are done in Gimli This film is much funnier than ERASERHEAD to be fair I should point out that ERASERHEAD is not a comedy and is in my opinion a better film There is one aspect of this film that deserves comment it is an independent production Many imaginative and interesting films are made independently The problem is that they have a hard time getting screened You may have to search out independent films as they get limited distribution and marketing but you may find the search to be worthwhile Overall I would not recommend this film to a general audience as it is simply too weird However I strongly recommend it to anyone that liked ERASERHEAD for this film is the better of the two Distribution Being screened at a limited number of theaters in the U S in the San Francisco area it is shown weekly at one theater as a midnight film

0645,Crimes and Misdemeanors,1989,Capsule review Two stories somewhat intertwined to make a single story of morel decisions and their consequences show up most of the popular dramatic media as being pallid morality plays These are clearly not morality plays They are realistic and at least one is very worth seeing There are not many filmmakers who can make a film about moral philosophy and get away with it at least not a film with deeper thoughts than that unjust acts are punishable by having Sly Stallone blow you up with a hand grenade Woody Allen is one director who can make a film about ethical dilemmas And he has the courage to treat them in a manner that is realistic and non Hollywoodish enough that some may feel that the story does not work or is somehow incomplete CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS does not just reject the popular ending it is an indictment of the popular dramatic media and the people who create it CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is really two stories only tangentially related as far as the plot is concerned though each in some way throws light on the other One of the stories starts superficially as if it was inspired by FATAL ATTRACTION Successful opthalmologist Judah Rosenthal played by Martin Landau in his best role ever has been having a two year affair with a neurotic stewardess played by Anjelica Huston She now threatens to ruin his career frame him for embezzlement and destroy his marriage if he does not marry her His brother played by Jerry Orbach offers to arrange to have the mistress murdered Judah has very strong moral principles but he also has a lot he can lose if the mistress is not stopped The other story involves Cliff Stern played by Woody Allen an unsuccessful documentary filmmaker whose dream and long term goal is to make a film about a philosophy professor with a very deep life affirming philosophy Instead he is commissioned to make a film about a very successful television comedy producer who happens to be Stern s brother in law The producer played by a perfectly cast Alan Alda is glib and polished makes pseudo profound pronouncements on the nature of comedy and in general personifies just about everything that Stern despises The situation is exacerbated by a love triangle with a television documentary maker played by Mia Farrow who steadfastly refuses to let talent rub off on her no matter how many times Allen casts her The irony is that Stern s hero Dr Levy seems to have ideas no more profound than those of the television producers Stern hates even if Levy does express them more eloquently Of the two stories by far the more meat is in the story of the opthalmologist with the moral dilemma In that we see the ethical philosophy illustrated The story of the filmmaker is more comedy and is sure to be more of an audience pleaser but it is also far less ambitious It is the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down There seem to be four ways to get a major role in a Woody Allen film You can be an established actor such as Claire Bloom You can be an under rated actor such as Landau whose career took a nosedive with Space 1999 and who until last year s TUCKER had been getting thankless roles not nearly commensurate with his talent You can get a role if Allen wants to make a point about you as an actor which he seems to have done with Alan Alda Actually it is surprising that Alda accepted a role that is so much of a put down on Alda himself The fourth way to get into an Allen film is the way Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow did and neither has really been an asset This is probably one of Allen s better serious films and I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0646,Crimes and Misdemeanors,1989,I have seen the movie of the year and it is Woody Allen s CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS previously it was HEATHERS followed by DO THE RIGHT THING to give an idea of where I m coming from CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS is quite unlike any Woody Allen movie that has preceded it it combines highly dramatic philosophical and religious issues while retaining some of the sarcastic humor that we would expect The plot structure would suggest that the movie be retitled Brothers and Sisters Although there is no star in this ensemble piece the main plot elements and issues revolve around opthamologist Judah Rosenthal played by Martin Landau Judah s brother is Jack a slimy underworld figure Jerry Orbach and his good friend is Ben a patient and a rabbi Sam Waterston Ben has a brother named Lester Alan Alda an unctuous TV sitcom mogul and a sister who is married to Clifford Stern the Woody Allen character Cliff has his own sister who is divorced with a teenage daughter that Cliff takes under his wing Not part of these families but involved romantically with them are Dolores Anjelica Huston and Hallie Mia Farrow of course in there somewhere This all sounds very complicated but it is in fact quite easy to follow all these relationships The plot not to give any spoilers revolves around the enormous ethical and religious dilemmas suffered by Judah Landau These crimes are mirrored by smaller crises in the life and work of Cliff Woody and also in the old movies to which he is addicted I found no flaw in the performances Alan Alda inherits what might be considered the Tony Roberts role but he convinced me that his was better suited for it than Roberts would be modifying his sleaziness and pomposity with just the right amount of generosity to prevent him from being totally detestable Martin Landau is low key but extremely effective in getting the audience s empathy my only complaint is that it seemed unrealistic that the character he portrayed would make some of the choices he did Sam Waterston does a fine job in making a saintly character sympathetic to the audience Woody is Woody although looking much older now and the other actors are all excellent in smaller roles Here then is a Woody Allen movie which brings the audience into the lives of the characters and provokes much thought without being painfully Bergman esque 4 worth seeing again at premium prices
0647,Fabulous Baker Boys The,1989,This film has a lot going for it and a lot not going for it It has a great beginning and ending pieced together with a yawn filled middle section It was written and directed by the same man whose name I don t remember Anyway let me explain myself Traditional screenplay format allows for a beginning a middle and an ending The middle section is the longest because it has to carry the weight of the dramatic development of the theme which has been proposed in the beginning and will be resolved in the ending The main trouble with the writing of the screenplay for THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS is that there is almost no development in the middle section It s almost as if the film could have gone from beginning to ending for all the development that takes place in the middle It s not that there isn t any but that it is so meager and rather unconvincing At one point I was wishing the film would hurry up and get over Don t take this to mean you should avoid this film because that would be a mistake The film has lots of other things going for it Although Hollywood nepotism has brought us lots of people we d just as soon forget about I don t count Lloyd Bridges sons Jeff and Beau amongst them Jeff Bridges has become a terrific actor Unfortunately in this film the director does a miserable job of bringing out his character s weaknesses weaknesses on which the plot rests Beau Bridges on the other hand does a fabulous job in his part In fact when he is missing from the middle section of the film it begins to drag He is completely convincing and I recommend anyone who takes an interest in acting to watch him in this film His performance and the direction of his character are first class Michelle Pfeiffer too does a top notch job of acting and rather surprisingly she can also sing It s wonderful to watch actors like Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer develop their acting skills over time It makes you want to go see what new thing they will bring to the screen next time Only a few other actors have this refreshing approach I refer to people like Meryl Streep Marlon Brando Dustin Hoffman Michelle as we know is a physically beautiful person Of course sexual attraction is subjective Michelle does not come across in this film as the type of person you would want to have an off hand fling with even though she plays the part of an ex call girl For me in this film she is definitely the bring home to mother type Perhaps I should personally analyse why I feel that way It s puzzling to me why I would want to bring Michelle s character home to mother while Michelle s performance is so shall we say worldly At any rate this brings up one very important reason why we the audience go to movies in the first place That is of course to learn about ourselves There s a lot of very nice minor touches in this film some decent music a very nice crane shot near the beginning a convincing bit actress in a bedroom scene also in the beginning some fuuny comedy as well as a wonderful showdown scene between the Baker boys There are also some nasty plot holes to watch out for I feel I have to add one more objection and that is overall the plot its development and resolution turn out to cost the characters next to nothing The film has a happy upbeat ending I like that What I don t like is when the decisions the characters make in a film don t cost them anything As we know there are no free lunches in life We as Americans don t expect any Decisions we make often cause the course of our entire lives to change There is pain involved a failing business an unhappy choice of profession a divorce forced separation from loved ones on and on THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS is a little too neat too pat too removed from the consequences of our choices for my taste So what I suggest is that you go see this movie even though it is uneven It has things to not recommend it but lots that do It s one of those films that you can learn from I would especially have liked to have strangled the director s ideas for the un development of Jeff Bridges character See if you agree you ll have some very nice moments along the way
0648,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,1989,You know going into any film with a numeral in the title that you re bound to be a little disappointed but the Phantom was a bit surprised at what a state the Halloween series is in Certainly he believed that the awful HALLOWEEN 3 SEASON OF THE WITCH should have killed the series once and for all and that if the irrelevant and boring Silver Shamrock shenanigans in that film didn t do it then the mechanical clockwork Jasonized killings of HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS would be the final nail in the series coffin The fact that more people were involved in the making of these films than attended them should have helped the series timely demise But no it seems that neither Michael nor Mustapha Akaad the series producer now that John Carpenter is long gone can be stopped And yet the Phantom finds that he himself can t stop going he was hooked at the tender age of 14 and has made it a lifelong habit He faithfully attends opening night showings of even the most horrible horror film in the hope that this one will be an unexpected pleasure this year s HELLRAISER or EVIL DEAD But HALLOWEEN 5 raises no hell and it s a toss up as to what s more dead about the film the plot the script or Donald Pleasence s performance If by now you get the feeling that the Phantom was less than satisfied with the latest Halloween well you re right But the film has it s good points and although they aren t enough to salvage the film they do make watching it a little more enjoyable or at least tolerable The camera work and cinematography are good and inventive as they were in HALLOWEEN 4 Although there are far too many false alarms most of Michael s scenes are well set up unlike the Friday the 13th series wherein people are dispatched left and right by an all but unseen Jason the Halloween series has always had Michael skulk around a bit before getting down to business This adds greatly to the suspense and some of the scenes in HALLOWEEN 5 are done with nearly as much flair as the original HALLOWEEN The opening credits are also very nicely done it s a shame that no one spent as much time on the rest of the film as was spent on its first 90 seconds But the film and the series looks tired the producers are just going through the motions now hoping to spend as little as possible on each film and just enough on advertising to promote sufficient video sales and rentals to turn a profit Worse the film has one of the most bogus endings of any in recent memory To those concerned with spoilers let me just say that there s a tall man dressed in black who steps off a bus mid way through the film and that he doesn t help matters any To anyone planning to see HALLOWEEN 5 the Phantom strongly recommends getting up and leaving the theater just before the final scene you ll be glad you did If you hang around the concession stand you ll be able to hear clearly the audience s collective reaction to the scene you missed aptly summarized by a greatly underaged boy in the audience Aw man that s bullsh t If it weren t for that final scene the Phantom would have given HALLOWEEN 5 a star and half out of 4 but Michael sends us all home with such an air of disappointment that 1 star is all it deserves Better to wait for this one to hit your local Blockbusters and save your money for SHOCKER Wes Craven s latest due out a few days before Halloween This one looks very good it looks like Craven is trying to recreate the success he had with the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET And since NIGHTMARE 5 was so disappointing the Phantom is glad that Craven is coming back to remind us all how good a horror film can be Also on the horizon is Robert Englund in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA the ads for which prominently display a disclaimer to the effect that the film is not based upon any previous Phantom of the Opera film stage show or book it s due out a week after SHOCKER but it doesn t look nearly as promising not the least because Menachem Golan half of the now defunct Cannon Films is associated with the film The Phantom will be back in a couple of weeks with reviews for both Until then he welcomes Phan mail from anyone interested in the shall we say non mainstream films he so loves
0649,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,1989,The Phantom has had some requests for a plot synopsis for HALLOWEEN 5 Normally he just reviews films and leaves the spoilers to Siskel and Ebert but since he s always eager to accommodate his phans here s a brief outline When we last left Michael he was at the bottom of a big hole in the ground having been shot 20 or 30 times by the local law But is he dead Well even the second graders sitting near the Phantom Friday night knew Michael wasn t really dead After seeing 5 minutes of HALLOWEEN 4 to set up the scene a formula stolen from the Friday the 13th series wherein for each F where F is the current film the first five minutes of F are equal to the last five minutes of F 1 we see that he escapes only to return to attempt to kill his niece Jamie who is now institutionalized after having killed her stepmother at the end of HALLOWEEN 4 and everyone around her Jamie spends most of the first half of the film in bed unable to speak because of the trauma she suffered at the hands of Michael it was he who made her kill her stepmom that s of course how we should all have known he was still alive Donald Pleasence is still around too looking much the worse for wear He implores Jamie to help him stop Michael but she refuses and instead writes things like He s coming on her blackboard and generally acts thoroughly possessed Why won t Jamie help the good doctor Well as it turns out she still has mixed feelings about her uncle after all even though he s a quasi human mass murderer he s still family But this doesn t come out until the end of the film after any sort of plot subtleties have been long forgotten During the course of the first half to two thirds of the film Michael manages to dispatch a half dozen random people mostly friends of Jamie s sister who he also gets Jamie s sister is notable for spending about five minutes in and out of a shower and a towel but the Phantom was disappointed to note that there s no almost no nudity in the film at all Indeed there s very little gore either although the lack of nudity surprised the Phantom since although gore costs money nudity is free After the five minute tease she s quickly dispatched and it s on to the next Jamie still has a telepathic link of some sort with Michael still sees his murders and even directs the police to a gas station in time to save Jamie s sister s friend from Michael s unkind hands But it s not until the film is almost over that she agrees to help trap Michael so that he can be killed once and for all Meanwhile we are treated to glimpses of a tall stranger dressed all in black who wears cowboy boots He steps off a bus about half way through the film and reappears every now and then but he really has nothing at all to do with the proceedings until the very end But we all see that he has the same tattoo on his wrist as Michael has on his wrist Things wind up at a farm somewhere which allows the film to rehash the barn scene from FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2 possibly 3 although the Phantom is still recovering from his 3 D induced headache In any case it s not nearly as good but it does give the film an excuse to waste an inordinate amount of time on false alarms and to show us two youngsters getting ready for a roll in the hay but again sorry guys there s nothing to see Finally everyone who isn t already dead winds up in the meadow and the doctor implores Michael to go home because only there will he be able to rid himself of his rage a gratuitous New Age touch At this point in the film going home was indeed on the Phantom s mind but he stuck it out to the bitter end The cast reconvenes at the place where it all began and everyone hunkers down to wait for Michael to come and try to kill his niece she s the bait of course The whole police force is there although it doesn t occur to anyone that guns haven t had a great effect on Michael in the past 12 years and that they re unlikely to have any effect now that we re into the third sequel Michael arrives eventually kills some cops beats up Pleasence a smattering of applause was heard for that and goes after Jamie The hide and seek scenes with Jamie are fairly well done and by the end when Jamie is trapped in the attic we see the results of Michael s carnage displayed artfully around the room Jamie is forced into a coffin one Michael dug up especially for her and just when Michael is about to kill her he s stopped by her cry of Uncle Well the Phantom thought it was funny even if it went over the heads of the second graders in the audience Jamie asks that she be allowed to see his face and she does but alas we don t We do see that Michael has black hair and that he s a sensitive guy since he sheds a tear when Jamie says We re just the same But of course they re not since Jamie is a nine year old girl and Michael is knife wielding maniac once he realizes this he gets back down to business and the chase continues Jamie escapes and Michael is finally tricked by the still not dead Pleasence and is incredibly taken into custody and put into a cell Phans if you do see this movie even against the Phantom s best advice please leave the auditorium or switch off your VCR at this point It s best just to assume that Michael will be back next year and not to worry too much how What happens is that the mysterious stranger in the cowboy boots walks into the jail and shoots all the cops Terminator style we see only the aftermath alas and springs Michael But truthfully the Phantom s rating of 1 star still stands no matter how bad he s made the film seem here HALLOWEEN 5 for all its faults is better than the last couple of Friday the 13th s although this certainly isn t saying much
0650,Black Rain,1989,A store near me sells a watch that comes with five watchbands of different colors and five watch faces to match The ad says it is five different watches in one The works of course remain the same You just change some superficial outer trappings and the ad would have you believe that you really have a different watch At times I think that the American film industry thinks that same way The story of BLACK RAIN was a good one at one time A cop is trying to bring a mean and violent criminal to justice The cop screws up and his prisoner escapes Now he has got to go out into the hostile environment to bring the creep to justice again Fortunately he gets someone to work with him Unfortunately he and his new partner can t stand each other But working together for a common goal against all odds they learn to respect each other and finally get the creep But they have also learned an important lesson in human understanding Yes Hollywood has once again remade RED SUN RED HEAT 48 HOURS BEVERLY HILLS COP and by now probably a dozen other films that have that same plot give or take a detail I will give whoever first wrote that plot some credit it would have been a good plot if it had been used once Too bad it has become such a popular standard that good filmmakers like Ridley Scott feel they can get away filming it again and calling it a new story Now let s get down to a few of the specific details for BLACK RAIL In this case the hostile environment is Osaka The main cop is really two American cops One is Nick a dishonest but basically good cop sleazily played by Michael Douglas Nick s close shaves are many but always figurative he seems to be able to go for what must be an entire week with the same two day growth of beard And if the Japanese think Americans are barbarians Douglas s character more than justifies the viewpoint The other cop is played much neater by Andy Garcia They stumble onto a Yakuza execution in New York City and nab a major Japanese hood However escorting him to Osaka turns out harder than they expected So they find themselves in a strange city in which they do not speak the language escorted by a dour faced Japanese detective Masahiro played in a nicely understated manner by Ken Takakura of THE YAKUZA The story is really about how Nick and Masahiro learn to respect each other and how with motorcycle chases and gunfights Nick regains his self respect and becomes honest again If such a hackneyed plot is to be turned into a watchable film by anyone it would probably be a Ridley Scott Scott has directed some good films though generally their weakness has been plot problems His ALIEN is a very good film but almost entirely because of mood and great visuals not because it has a stellar plot Similarly the visual sense of BLADE RUNNER outdistances the plot by miles Scott s plots are acceptable usually better than for BLACK RAIN s but it is the misty atmospheric feel of the film that makes his work worth seeing Watching a Scott film is the health equivalent of smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes Virtually every scene seems to have smoke or smog in it somewhere He has smoggy scenes of New York smoggy scenes of Osaka smoky steel refineries smoky police departments But even if he is starting to do the smoky bit a little too much he has a fresh eye particularly for accenting the alien in an alien culture His Osaka is a Japan we have rarely seen before from neon buses to smoky of course pachinko palaces I will give BLACK RAIN a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale as an atmospheric travelogue It was worth the 3 I paid just to see a different view of Japan I figure the plot comes along free and that was just a bit more than what it is worth
0651,Fat Man and Little Boy,1989,It is said that after the Pythagoreans of ancient Greece discovered the existence of irrational numbers they sought to keep it secret from the general population Apparently because it contradicted their entire philosophical view of the universe One story has it that they murdered a member of their own sect Hippasus for telling outsiders the secret See footnote 1 A good portion of FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is frittered away recalling just such secrecy as it regarded the development of the first atomic weapons The title refers to the names of the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and by extension I suppose to the two main characters in the film J Robert Oppenheimer and General Leslie R Groves If any film story ever deserved to be treated in epic proportions surely it must be this one But FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is no epic To describe it succinctly this movie s production fits like Mickey Rooney s suit on Hulk Hogan It has a lot on nicely framed cinematography a couple of inspired moments of lighting and screenwriting a journeyman performance by Paul Newman and little else to recommend it The problems are numerous John Cusack is miscast as a scientist He looks and acts more like a high school senior There are no characters for whom to root In fact J Robert Oppenheimer is portrayed as a sort of egomaniacal Commie psychopath who beguiles himself by his own seeming technical omnipotence General Groves the Pentagon man assigned to oversee the project would have been better named General Gross for this picture He has all the moral finesse of some of the members of Ronald Reagan s regime The part is however well rendered by Paul Newman There are many seemingly insignificant details that do this movie in For instance the recent addition to the language the word bimbo is used Remember this story takes place in the early forties Yogi Berra s oft quoted statement It ain t over till it s over had not yet been uttered much less popularized Modern looking diesel locomotives had not yet completely replaced steam engines I myself can remember going from Boston to Chicago with my mother in 1947 on a train with a steam engine that had to be replaced at night because it was so loud it kept people awake in the sleeper cars And the gigantic trainyards at Erie Pennsylvania were chock full of steam giants with nary a diesel to be seen The score for this film by Ennio Morricone at one point makes a line of trucks meant I suppose to portray the earnestness of the project look ludicrous The material itself just does not lend itself to anything less than epic proportions For one reason it is an historical drama We all know how the story turns out This removed the crucial element of suspense from the film But nothing stepped in to take its place no characters to root for no convincing love interests not even any emotional range which goes from mad to angry and back A film should definitely have a greater emotional range than a mother in law The production itself is expensive and authentic except for what was previously noted The drama in the production is Who cares If it weren t for the fact that these awesome weapons still threaten us today I don t think anyone would have any reason at all to go see this film except if maybe you be an inveterate Paul Newman fan or your mother in law has announced she s coming over Catch this one on cable and save your money for something more important like a six pack and TV wrestling on Saturday night
0652,Fat Man and Little Boy,1989,This is yet another telling of the story of the development of the atomic bomb I have been informed by a knowledgeable person L Badash that the total count of such films is between 4 6 This story is well documented by many historians Hersey Jungk most recently Rhoades and dozens of other authors The story is important to the history of science because it happens about the time when science in America became big even before Sputnik This makes the story complex few single people who stand out The perspective is largely from Leslie Groves whom many people don t realize built the Pentagon played by Paul Newman for star value The second is from a new young physicist fresh from Chicago He is involved in many aspects of the development ignoring compartmentalization The other notable members of the physics and science communities are simply blurs Time is compressed and distorted A post war event with Plutonium is added for dramatic effect In fact lots of stuff is sacrificed for dramatic effect The affair that Oppenheimer has in the movie did take place but it was overblown J R had more problems with his brother Frank who founded the SF Exploratorium and DID work at Los Alamos and his Berkeley friends These are the basic characters Laura Dern plays a nurse involved the the young physicist The other real people from Szilard to Stimson make appearances but you have to know the players in advance to know who they are The scenery is spectacular It rivals nearly the real Los Alamos Oh to answer one quick question NO Richard Feynman does not appear as a character The film does not convey the fear that the physicists and other felt at the beginning of the war If this film has been made closer to WWII it would have probably told a different story Such advantage different perspectives allow Note that one scene involving radiation sickness probably had Dr Robert Gale UCLA and Chernobyl as a consultant Place names code names had to be removed who ever heard of Oak Ridge before the War The American Playhouse PBS series Oppenheimer with Sam Waterston is a better accounting But it tends to make the physicists looks innocent Quick additional rating since I was at odds with the IN COUNTRY review 0 contrasting to the 2
0653,Breaking In,1989,I just saw the movie BREAKING IN last night It s the story of Ernie an aging veteran burglar safe cracker who meets Mike a kid with a casual disrespect for other people s property The story develops as Ernie decides to show Mike the ins and outs literally of what Ernie calls thieving The result is a gentle comedy that takes a lighter look at crime without lapsing into slapstick or farce The script was written by John Sayles RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN BABY IT S YOU EIGHT MEN OUT and the film was directed by Bill Forsyth GREGORY S GIRL LOCAL HERO COMFORT AND JOY Those familiar with the work of the two men will recognize their trademarks witty dialogue understated characters and quiet humor Perhaps the most pleasing thing about BREAKING IN is the portrayal of Ernie by Burt Reynolds Eschewing his characteristic smirk and unnaturally curly hairpiece Reynolds plays Ernie as written a graying 61 year old thief with thinning hair bad eyes and a limp Ernie is a survivor in the world of crime a philosophical professional thief who has accepted a low profile lifestyle in exchange for anonymity with the police With another actor Ernie could just be a rather dull workaday crook but Reynolds charm and touch for light comedy make Ernie an interesting likable character Mike well played by Casey Siemaszcko sp is a naive unsophisticated kid who is drawn to the apparent glamour represented by Ernie The real interest in the film is watching Ernie who treats crime as a job try to instill in Mike who treats crime as an adventure the attitude that will allow Mike to survive as Ernie has The humor comes from Mike s naivete and bumbling attempts to adapt to the lifestyle of a professional thief While ostensibly a crime film there is no real violence in BREAKING IN and little serious tension This may deter viewers who cannot watch a film without at least one car chase or gunshot victim However for those who like character pieces and the sort of humor found in the films of Sayles and Forsyth this film should prove enjoyable And for fans of Burt Reynolds this will be the chance to seem him in what is probably his best comedic role since STARTING OVER in 1979 I recommend it
0654,Fabulous Baker Boys The,1989,I don t know what you can say about a quart of vanilla ice cream THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS is the story of two brothers Jack Baker played by Jeff Bridges and his brother Frank played by his brother Beau For 31 years they have played piano together and by now they have become an institution on the cocktail bar circuit This is a film about the highs and lows of the cocktail piano game where the highs don t get very high and the lows are only a little bit bluesy and the men are laid back as all get out As we meet our intrepid heroes they are just sort of getting along but they could be doing better Brother Frank decides that the group could use a female vocalist so they audition and end up with sultry Suzie Diamond played and actually sung by Michelle Pfeiffer With Suzie s singing they start doing okay They get some better bookings On the horizon is a little low key romance and a little low key conflict Steven Kloves who wrote and directed does have have considerable feel for his characters and his occasional comedy light like almost everything else in this film does work well some of the time A case in point is a scene with Jack and Suzie sharing a suite of rooms in a posh hotel checking out each other s toiletries Also neatly handled is a telethon the brothers sign to play at Frank s insistence only to find it is a high school production to earn money for a gymnasium This is a style of filmmaking we have not seen for a while perhaps since the Forties The film builds a sort of laid back piano bar mood and is never anxious to get anywhere Pfeiffer gets full marks as a steamy torch singer but when she is not singing she just squeaks by as acceptable One may speculate that the sibling rivalry of the title characters may reflect some sibling rivalry of the actors but it is hard to be sure If the film is watchable it is mostly for the attraction of the actors The story itself is as slow and languorous as one of Ms Pfeiffer s songs Rate the film a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0655,Mirch masala,1985,Synopsis In a rural village in colonial India the tax collector an evil petty tyrant lusts after the town beauty She hides in the local spice factory which becomes a besieged fortress The men of the town are willing to give her to the tax collector only the women dare to resist An interesting story of sexual and political oppression India English subtitles color 1986 approx 100 minutes Director Ketan Mehta The time is 1940 approximately India is still under British colonial rule and Gandhi is alive and active in politics To collect taxes the British use a system of subedars or tax collectors The subedars visit villages meet with the village chiefs and negotiate the taxes to be paid The village chiefs then assess each family in the village a portion of the taxes The system of subedars was ripe for abuse The subedar was generally accompanied by groups of soldiers and had the power to collect taxes by force Sometimes the soldiers would engage in looting and other hostile acts The split of the taxes collected was 50 for the British colonial government 45 for the local feudal lord usually a Maharajah and 5 for the subedar Thus the subedar had direct financial incentive to extract as much tax as possible from the villages This film depicts the events in a small rural village that occur when the subedar visits and demands more than the usual tax payments Here the subedar is a young man with a handlebar mustache and a fancy phonograph which he uses to amaze the villagers The village throws a party of sorts at which all the women of the village dance Here the subedar decides which women he wants to sleep with Later that night one of the women is brought to his tent He is upset he wanted a different woman Sonbai who happens to be married her husband is away working for the railroads The next day he sees her and approaches her and makes advances She refuses his advances and even slaps him This is an insult to his honor for he is a man powerful and of high caste she is a woman low caste with no husband and barren no children He orders his soldiers to capture her she flees and hides in a spice factory At the spice factory she finds an ally the guard an old man with a shotgun and a strong sense of morals He is the only person willing to defend Sonbai The factory becomes a kind of fortress surrounded by soldiers outside and Sonbai and the factory workers all female inside This causes a crisis in the village for the subedar is demanding that Sonbai be turned over to him It is an affront to the sexual honor of the village Eventually the men of the village give in and agree to turn her over However Sonbai refuses This leaves Sonbai and the women of the village to resist the subedar alone and the story continues from there This film is very well made and though slow moving at times will hold your interest well Like many Indian films it does have singing and dancing in it but it all takes place within the context of the story and is not grafted in or gratuitous as it is in so many Indian films The biggest criticism that I would make of the film is that the handling of the social message sexual and political oppression is self conscious at times and reduces the entertainment level of the film For example there is a subplot about the village chief neglecting and beating his wife This subplot adds little to the main story However despite this it is a very good film and is worth seeing Distribution Currently showing at a limited number of theaters in the U S first U S theatrical release is in progress
0656,Shocker,1989,The Phantom takes some of the blame for the letdown his phans will surely feel upon leaving SHOCKER truthfully he added to the unwarranted hype surrounding the film by encouraging his readers to save their money for Wes Craven s latest by avoiding the dismal HALLOWEEN 5 two weeks ago But surely no one could be more disappointed than the Phantom himself who has admired Craven since his horror debut THE HILLS HAVE EYES over a decade ago and who has followed his career avidly ever since from the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET to THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW Of course there have been some duds along the way DEADLY BLESSING comes to mind but even the ones that weren t standouts were generally a cut above the usual horror fare Pholks there s good news and mostly bad news with this one The good news is that Craven still makes some of the most interesting horror films around the creator of Freddy Kruger and the atmospheric SERPENT has returned with Horace Pinker a truly loathsome character who has as much personality as Freddy but who spends considerably less time talking and considerably more time killing Horace you see is a television repairman with a taste for murdering people whole families actually and although he cracks a joke now and then he is to Freddy Kruger what Dolph Lundgren is to Bruce Willis But sadly Craven doesn t seem to know what to do with Horace during the first half of the film Horace is strictly a devil worshiping maniac actually a television worshiping manic though the Phantom has long believed them to be one in the same but as the film progresses Horace becomes more and more like Freddy thus doing himself and his audience no favor at all if we wanted Freddy and after the disappointing NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5 it s not clear that we do any more we d head for our local Blockbusters This brings us to the bad news of which there is plenty We ll start with the plot although even with his Official Phantom Film Reviewer s Notebook R the Phantom was unable to jot down all of the loose ends false starts missed opportunities and what looked to be the outcome of a few too many script conferences with nervous studio executives It boils down to this quite simply somewhere along the way someone lost faith in this film Someone decided that audiences don t really want to see horror films that are filled with horror instead they d rather watch a watered down Elm Street clone So a film that begins with a great good many killings some quite messy indeed transforms itself about half way through into an Elm Street retread complete with the requisite Is this a dream or isn t it sequences and cut rate ELM STREET special effects The plot goes hither and yon never quite settling down into anything we can sink our fangs into For a while Horace is a run of the mill mass murderer Yet Our Hero Jonathan Parker can sense him in his dreams shades of Elm Street here and even join him as he stalks and kills various family members in a house miles away Why is this We never find out because after about 30 minutes Horace is captured by the police and the film comes to a screeching halt as we wait for Horace to get the chair though once the action shifts to the prison things pick up a bit Needless to say Horace survives this in one form or another and the film lurches onward for a while in a completely different vein Then after another 30 minutes have passed the film transforms itself yet again as Horace finds a way to live on by inhabiting and using the bodies of those around him This lack of pacing and continuity is one of the biggest problems with SHOCKER As Craven picks up and discards ideas how television violence especially television news affects us a couple of dream sequences some possessions a bit of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD a couple of gross out scenes some flirting with the tired love conquers all theme the film goes all over the place and ends up nowhere Why Craven didn t just start the film with a brief introduction and then 50 000 volts is a mystery Why waste half an hour on a traditional Hero Chasing Murderous Lunatic plot when it turns out to be almost entirely irrelevant to the remainder of the film which is anything but traditional and in fact borders occasionally on the truly weird Along with its continuity problems SHOCKER also suffers from too many scenes that misfire scenes that may have worked better on paper than they do in the theater where they generally had the audience and the Phantom himself hooting in both laughter and derision And there s still more bad news phans With the exception of Horace the characters and the actors who portray them are uniformly bad as is the dialogue although Horace does get in a few good lines Freddy style toward the end Worst is Jonathan s father a police lieutenant more shades of ELM STREET who despite overwhelming evidence that something out of the ordinary is happening steadfastly refuses to believe that Horace isn t just your garden variety fully human non electrified lunatic True most horror films are filled with people who wander innocently down basement steps or say There must be a logical explanation for all this without cracking a smile but the lieutenant truly tries our patience and makes nearly every one of his scenes an agony of bad acting bad delivery and bad scripting The same can be said of Jonathan s girlfriend Alison after taking leave of the movie early on she returns later to appear in some of the most awful scenes in the film during which time the audience prayed fervently repeatedly and vocally for her timely death Lest the Phantom make SHOCKER out to be a complete disappointment he will say that although it doesn t always succeed in its goals although it misses too many payoffs and although it loses its way and its audience about half way through SHOCKER remains one of the year s better horror films In a year that brought us nothing new from Clive Barker or Stuart Gordon and with only the unrelentingly stupid PET SEMATARY and a smattering of warmed over horror sequels to compare it to SHOCKER is worth seeing Certainly it s worth 2 stars and it s certainly more entertaining than the rather tedious HALLOWEEN 5 which is it s only competition at the moment See it for its top notch camera work and for the way Craven can set up a scene be it a FRIDAY THE 13TH like attack in a bathroom or a NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD like chase through a park See it for an original and entertaining new horror personality though one who won t have his own 900 number television series or merchandising blitz this Halloween because despite the occasional wisecrack he is just too loathsome too vicious and too cruel to attract the mass market audience that Freddy can And see it because it will most likely be a long cold winter before we get another horror film that s substantially better For all it s flaws SHOCKER is mostly fun and if you don t mind the lumbering plot it s almost never boring So go phans but keep your expectations in check and your hopes among the popcorn littering the theater s floor Don t expect a film as original or as well executed as the the first Elm Street but if your nature is more forgiving than The Phantom s you might find it quite enjoyable
0657,Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,1989,So far there hasn t been much response on the net to HALLOWEEN 5 not that horror get that much attention anyway The Phantom s review and a couple of subsequent articles are all that has been posted that I have seen and all of the above relate what a letdown the movie is was Hold on here comes a different opinion I must admit that I went to see Michael s latest jaunt with a good deal of skepticism I think that any sequel can lend this feeling to even the most ardent fan of a particular series However I was not disappointed at all with this film Addressing the most befuddling part of the film the ending seems to be appropriate for going first The appearance of the stranger in black and the brief glimpses of his travels through Haddonfield is given no explanation but there are a few hints given in the film about his her its link to Mr Myers We are shown that they both possess an identical mark on the right wrist This mark can also be seen briefly in the basement of the old Myers house It can be seen on a wall behind Dr Loomis at one point Then just as we thought that Michael would be put away for good he looked so dejected to have had his mask taken away from him the stranger clobbers everyone in the police station and apparently takes Michael with him Talk about membership having its privileges My guess is and I have heard nor read any rumor of this that the stranger is someone whom Michael met while in the asylum and inducted Myers into some sort of occult circle Just a thought Anyway about the rest of the film I thought that the direction was great The fast flashy images at the beginning when Jamie Danielle Harris was having her Michael attack and Loomis Donald Pleasance saved her from a tracheotomy by seconds was well acted well shot and well timed Some of the stalking scenes were perhaps a tad long but the eerieness that came across from the claustrophobic shots e g the laundry chute and the shadow manipulation e g inside the barn was very effectively done I liked the script itself The producer Moustapha Akkad is doing a good job of obtaining scripts that maintain and adhere to the storyline that Carpenter set up in the first film Sure they have taken a few liberties with the Michael mythos but the attempting to present a sequel that reaches even half of the quality of an original is extremely difficult Certain story aspects have to be altered Audience bias against sequels is probably the most difficult hurdle to overcome If you don t believe this to be a prevalent factor have someone mail you all of the articles posted during this summer s sequelitis spree There were sequels condemned before they were seen by posters to this group In reference to some comments made by others I didn t see the ending as a letdown as much as I saw it as an intriguing if not bewildering at first bridge to the next film The producer s intend s to create an honest to goodness serial out of these films which basically they have been anyway This type of transition the introduction of characters without explanation helps to move the films out of the episodic nature and into that of a true serial I think it is a neat idea When I say episodic I mean each part is not contingent on any of the previous parts e g the Indiana Jones series I hesitate to classify the Halloween series at least the Myers story as slasher The Friday the 13th movies have evolved into a slasher series Slasher to me implies mindless unmotivated wholesale slaughter Michael has motivation and is far from mindless His whole motivation is sexual as established by the first film and used throughout the rest He is psychotic true and I think that possession at least according to the Halloween novelization is the result of the mental snap he had during the first scene of the first film One dead sister not babysitter How many babysitters sit nude in someone else s bedroom using their hair brush Don t answer that Also there is a lot more going on here than a simple stalk em slash em story here The director and writers present more than just a psycho offing everyone he finds which he isn t doing anyway Take for example the barn sex scene Did they have the eventually pitchforked guy wear a Michael suit and mask simply for the prank pulled on the policemen I think that the suit coupled with the guy coupling in the following scene gave the audience a great metaphor for Michael s condition in the first place Michael seeing himself doing what he himself can t do and subsequently enrages him puts an end to seeing this by giving the faux Myers a tine he would never forget Sorry I couldn t resist that one Otherwise that kill would have had no motivation behind it If your main motivation for film going is nudity then yes you will be disappointed However if you have enjoyed the Myers story to date then this continuation soon to be a true continuation should satisfy you for another year or two I enjoyed it very much especially getting to see Donald again If you enjoy a mental challenge and can appreciate good direction writing and acting then I highly recommend this film I intend to catch it again if and when it comes to the cheaper second run theater here
0658,Worth Winning,1989,Judging from WORTH WINNING America is in deep trouble I knew that the film probably wouldn t be too good because it has Lesley Ann Warren in it but I went to see it anyway It is so deeply shallow that there s not a whole lot to be said about it Most of us have seen the television show MOONLIGHTING no doubt Well if you ve seen MOONLIGHTING you ve seen WORTH WINNING WORTH WINNING however is much more predictable Mark Harmon takes the place of Bruce Willis He talks to the camera explains his feelings what s happening in the story etc Admittedly I missed the very beginning because the Boston Globe with its usual crummy quality control had the wrong start time printed But it didn t matter This TV program that thinks it s a movie is such a formula flick that you don t need to catch the opening to understand it Here s the plot Two friends make a bet that one of them can can t get three women to agree to marry one of them He does but falls for one The women find out and turn the tables on him He repents and wins back the lady Pure hack This movie defines new lows in the consumer mentality that has overtaken America It assumes that we are all part of a great era of dreck in which reality is defined not by any drive to make ourselves better as individuals as a people as a nation but by our unblinking acceptance of the drivel of consumerism We are no longer looked upon as thinking people or even as film audiences We are media consumers Boy does this flick ever make you feel like an consumer Lesley Ann Warren is one reason I went She is a wonderful talented lady It s a pity she seems to always appear in stuff that is way below her capabilities I don t know if she herself has the bad taste her agent the casting directors the producers I just don t know How awful to watch someone loaded with talent consistently exploited in demeaning roles Of course she has considerable physical charms but while undoubtedly a reliable aspect for manipulation of the audience hormone production is best left where it belongs with pharmaceutical companies Lesley Ann is wasted in this outing There are so few good screen parts written for women that taking someone as talented as Lesley and using her in a part like this should be made part of the felony statutes Nevertheless she does a good job in the second rate role of a vapid repressed housewife I can only hope that the producers and financiers of this piece of skit will get to read reviews like this and somehow get it through their witless skulls that vulgarities jiggling tits and a hack TV formula do not a movie make They should stick to things they re best at like manipulating the stock market or certain of their anatomical appendages This is not light comedy it s a comedy for air heads which is what the producers apparently think of their audience Do yourself a favor Miss this one even on cable
0659,Drachenfutter,1987,Synopsis In modern West Germany a young man from Pakistan a gastarbeiter or guest worker tries to gain legal residence He eventually gets an illegal job in a Chinese restaurant Later he and a Chinese waiter from the restaurant try to open their own restaurant A human interest story detailing the difficulties faced by guest workers in Germany a good but not great film West Germany English subtitles black and white 1988 75 minutes Director Writer Jan Schutte The film is centered on Shezad a personable young man from Pakistan who is in Hamburg West Germany trying to gain legal residence via political asylum He is receiving welfare while his application is being processed He lives with his friend Rashid also from Pakistan and also applying for political asylum They live in a seedy welfare hotel with immigrants and guest workers from other third world countries Eventually with the help of a con man Shezad gets an illegal job at a second rate Chinese restaurant The restaurant is owned by a Chinese man the staff includes a Chinese waiter Shezad and two other guest workers for kitchen help and a tyrannical German cook The cook has a very high opinion of himself and his cooking and is very critical of his kitchen staff he frequently refers to them as wops Shezad and the Chinese waiter Xiao become friends They share a common dream to open their own restaurant Xiao can satisfy the all the regulations necessary to open a restaurant under the German Restaurant Law save one the requirement of 5000 marks capital Shezad and Xiao team up to pursue their dream of owning a restaurant and the story continues from there This film appears to have been done on a low budget and is mostly a human relations study It principally deals with the aspirations of third world immigrants and guest workers in West Germany These immigrants are depicted as forming a lower economic class with limited interaction with German society a society that is indifferent and sometimes hostile to them The major attraction of the film is the characters as the film progresses you begin to identify with the main characters and understand the difficult situation they face Gaining legal residence in West Germany is difficult many apply but few are chosen Overall this is a good film it has won many awards at film festivals all over the world However it has a slow pace and is oriented towards human relations it is not an action film Print Source New Yorker Films no information available on release plans
0660,Ours L,1988,Some films are just simple enough and pure enough that they look effortless They seem as if they put themselves together with nearly everything clicking One such film is THE BEAR even the title is simple and pure The film covers about a month or so in the life of a young bear The film s greatest fault is that it is too short about 90 minutes and covering so short a span in the bear s life is simply not satisfying enough The filmmakers could easily make this the beginning of a series about the same bear and not have it wear thin after ten chapters The bear or more accurately the two bears in this film are characters that audiences will really want to know more about THE BEAR has a minimum of dialogue and no narration This helps avoid having the film be as cutesy or sugary as some Disney wildlife documentaries but it means the story is told more slowly than if a narrator were telling you plot When the bear is sad you pick it up from body language and inference rather than being told and the emotion is felt by the viewer far deeper this way At the same time much of the emotion gets understated When the bear loses her mother it is probably more traumatic than the film can convey The story set in the Canadian wilderness is of a young bear whose mother is accidentally killed After staying with the body hoping it will move again the bear finds that she I think it was a she must find food for herself She finds and seeks the protection of a large bear who as it happens is being hunted by a group of men The film could easily have made the men soulless beasts particularly since the film is both implicitly and explicitly an argument against hunting To the film s credit both man and animal are to some degree sympathetic The photography of the Canadian wilderness and of the bears in it is constantly enthralling Faults of the film A couple of the animals look more like props on fishing lines specifically a butterfly and a frog The film tries to put you inside the mind of the bear seeing dreams and at one point a hallucination Just what a bear would see in these different states of consciousness we will probably never know and the film s interpretation is speculative at best The bear s voice was dubbed after shooting and seems often to be unrealistically expressive though I do not have sufficient knowledge of bears to decide if that is really true Jean Jacques Annaud who previously did QUEST FOR FIRE is to be commended for making one of the most original as well as one of the five best films of the year My rating is a low 3 on the 4 to 4 scale If Annaud promises to make a sequel a year to THE BEAR just telling us as well what the bear is up to that year I promise to buy a film ticket to each one If he spends the rest of his life telling the story of this one bear it will be well spent
0661,Second Sight,1989,This made for TV movie is now playing in theaters for 6 and is posing as a real movie with big screen talents and skills This however is not the case If you are interested in New Age stuff this movie can provide many guffaws and chortles but it might insult some who take the psychic arts seriously The cast consists of John Larroquete reprising his part as a shifty money grubbing woman grabbing slob from Night Court Only he s not a lawyer he s a PI Bronson Pinchot could have been replaced in this movie with a manniquin or Roger Rabbit for all the believability and motivation he portrayed The other namable character well I ve forgetten his name again He previously played a psychiatrist on Night Court who was in charge of a famous rock star Michael Jackson Sid Barrett type Well in the TV show he was in it only for the money There are three love interests in this movie but except for the one playing the nun yes I said nun they are interchangable with fast cars or bizaare gadgets The movie provides a humorous account of the events around a power psychic who channels a dead Jewish guy named Murray Well the nun was Murray s girlfriend before he died Hummm Anyway the special effects if that is what you spend 6 to see are pretty lame and could be reproduced with a VCR and a 4th of July sparkler Perhaps if the effects were better I would have enjoyed the movie more but I doubt it I did laugh I laughed loud and hard For the same reason I rent Z grade sci fi pulp movies and laugh Lousy characters transparent plot lines stupid motivations and poor effects And I got someone else to pay the 6 for me
0662,Phantom of the Opera The,1989,Capsule review Somebody took what would have been a poor re telling of PHANTOM and proved it could be made much much worse Believe it or not they threw in time travel and an immortal Freddy Krueger esque killer I thought I was a completist enough to want to see all versions of the semi classic story but this was a total and contemptible mess representing the producer s profound and cynical disrespect for his audience Rating 3 To date there have been four movie versions of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA The title role has been played by Lon Chaney Claude Rains Herbet Lom and Maximillian Schell Now there have been four and a tenth It is clear that somebody was serious about making a version of the semi classic story and somebody else was not Nominally Dwight Little is the director of the new film though his name is pasted over somebody else s on the posters So what we get is an exquisitely clumsy cross between a lackluster but traditional telling of the story and an episode of Freddy s Nightmares Christine Daae is an opera singer in modern day Manhattan who finds an old piece of music by a forgotten composer who was also a serial killer She decides to use it for an audition for an opera During her audition she is coshed on the head by a sandbag and suddenly with no apparent bewilderment she is an opera singer from the chorus in 1884 London The story that is then told is just barely recognizable as a version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA A great but unknown composer has made a pact with the Devil that if his music should become immortal he would sell his soul The Devil adds his own little amendment by gouging pieces out of the composer s face The Phantom can make himself almost normal but only by sewing pieces of live flesh into his face so much for the romance of the mask The Phantom now lives under the opera house and teaches his Christine mercilessly torture killing anyone who gets in his way He skins two people alive and beheads two others Meanwhile Christine is bewildered as to why she is able to remember the words to sing to the Phantom s music not remembering that she learned them in New York Classic scenes such as the chandelier scene and the unmasking are dispensed with entirely well sort of Later when the story returns to the present it turns more into a traditional supernatural molester story I cannot imagine how this film turned into such an unholy mess Only part of the mess can be explained by saying they had a gory version of the traditional story and well into the shooting they decided they wanted to turn it into a totally different film That would explain the change of directors It would also explain the credits Screenplay by Duke Sandefur Based on a screenplay by Gerry O Hara Somebody must have decided they could not sell Robert Englund as anything but a supernatural unstoppable killer like his Freddy Krueger The result is a sort of a PEGGY SUE SINGS FOR THE PHANTOM ON ELM STREET that is a crude hoax that will disappoint Phantom fans Freddy fans and everybody in between I would like to give this film a full 4 but for a little nice opera and a few scenes that were almost an okay adaptation of the story I will give it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0663,Beer Drinkers Guide to Fitness and Filmmaking The,1989,I am on the selection committee for the cinema club at Bell Labs in Holmdel due to the tremendous acumen I have shown in my cinematic writing and because they will allow anyone to help choose the films One of the other members has been pushing for some time to show THE BEER DRINKER S GUIDE TO FITNESS AND FILMMAKING I don t believe that he has actually seen the film but I think he likes the title The club has been on occasion willing to humor this member but we have been unable to find a distributor for the film By an odd coincidence the director Fred G Sullivan has also been unable to find a distributor Finally Sullivan has been able to get the film distributed in a manner that makes maximum use of the clever title and with minimum distribution risk It has been released on videocassette THE BEER DRINKER S GUIDE TO FITNESS AND FILMMAKING is more a collection of amateur sound home movies that form more a sort of family journal than a real story though in the course of its telling we do learn a lot perhaps more than we want about filmmaker Fred and the Family Sullivan Fred made amateur films most of his life and as an adult is raising a large family in the Adirondacks on what he can make from his films His first feature film was COLD RIVER an adaptation of a novel set in the Adirondacks It apparently didn t do much for Fred who leads a hand to mouth existence often just after changing diapers His children cooperate in misbehaving for the camera acting up and badly Children do not really make good actors in spite of the maxim that claims they and dogs are the best Fred s ingenuousness starts to wear a little thin by the middle of the film and the 84 minutes seem like more Among the skits he throws in is one of a college professor who deeply admires his work It is a piece of silliness that could work at the hands of a better filmmaker but the silliness is not contagious It becomes clear also that Fred finds his own life and his family cuter than most of the audience will Eventually one really feels like grabbing Fred by the collar and telling him Look your family is hungry and you are trying to feed them by selling cute home movies of them You really are going to have to find another line of work My rating is a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0664,Signs of Life,1989,As some of you might know the Seattle Film Festival finished about five months ago Well uh I ve been busy jm Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival This is another American Playhouse production that has an almost trademarked style to it I sometimes wonder if a film funded by the AP underwriters is required to have a setting in small town or rural America Its scope isn t exceptional it examines the effects of closing a small boat building firm in New England on its workers and their families and friends and it takes the weekend in the life approach of studying its characters in almost separate storylines One of the workers wants to go to Florida to become a diver but is hindered by having to care for his retarded brother another wants to follow his friend on his diving expedition but doesn t know how or whether to break up with his long standing romantic relationship The elderly owner of the company is desperately trying to drum up business for another boat in the town meanwhile he s having hallucinations of his dead father visiting him trying to tell him something or are they hallucinations And finally Beau Bridges plays the company foreman who is desperately trying to find work in the town to support his wife and 5 children The film takes a St Elsewhere approach to its material it s often funny and whimsical but it seems as if disaster could be around the corner The film is emotionally satisfying it isn t hugely imaginative in its conclusion but it didn t telegraph the ending at all and worked nicely The actors all give good performances and carry off their roles well Several of them were also in MYSTIC PIZZA and the almost identical settings tends to merge the two in my memory The only exception is Bridges his performance and indeed his entire sub plot seems to have almost been scotch taped on at the last minute Solid enjoyable show since it s an American Playhouse production you ll probably be able to see it on PBS sometime next year
0665,Kimurake no hitobito,1988,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival YEN FAMILY Japan 1988 Director Yojiro Takita Screenwriter not supplied in program Cast Takeshi Kaga Kaori Momoi Hiromi Iwasaki Mitsunori Isaki Yojiro Takita has been getting a reputation as a full blown satirist of Japanese culture in the Western press at least which is a questionable reference His previous work COMIC MAGAZINE let Japanese TV and tabloid journalism have both barrels but in a scatter shot manner it often reduced its satire to the level of a typical MAD magazine parody and seemed to loose control of just where it was going YEN FAMILY which deals with an incredibly mercantile money hustling family has almost precisely the same problem it s one major improvement over COMIC MAGAZINE is that it tends to spoof both sides i e the nouveau rich and the traditionalists However Takita still seems to be unable to break his two mode characters they re usually acting completely zany but have interludes where the audience seems to be expected to take them seriously The youngest member of the family decides that the spiritual life is being neglected in his home and tries to pull his parents and sister out of their full bore capitalism this brings about the funniest parts of the film but also tries to introduce some fairly maudlin sentiment at the end
0666,Heathers,1989,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival Director Michael Lehmann Screenwriter Daniel Waters Cast Winona Ryder Christian Slater Shannen Doherty Lisanne Falk Kim Walder Penelope Milford While not running on all eight cylinders HEATHERS crosses the finish line with 6 8 of them going full blast and is one of the funniest films of the year which should be a good enough recommendation for most folks methinks It has generally been labeled a black comedy though not nearly as dark as I had been led to believe from local reviewers who were apparently afraid that high school murders treated comically were more likely to offend than Freddy s latest outing Go figure and seems to be mentioned in the same breath with RIVER S EDGE probably because both deal with high school kids and murder That s about where the similarities end though HEATHERS is also a witty acid send up of high school conventions in the upper middle classes with more on target barbs than I can remember seeing in every Brat Pack film John Hughes has done in the last eight years It s satire mean spirited nasty cunning satire which is of course the best and most honest kind Winona Ryder plays a high school student who when the film opens is a member of Westerburg High School s most exclusive clique of girls She s getting uncomfortable though with the mental and social cruelty that her peers are dishing out every day and when a handsome sardonic outsider Christian Slater starts up with her she thinks this might be her way out of the clique It is but not in the way she thinks The film s strong points rest between the outrageousness of the plot murders assumed to be suicides in the school population and the effects on the students parents and the community and the wonderful dialogue and mannerisms of the characters Yeah I ve been out of high school for over a decade thankGodthankGodthankGod but the cadence and attitudes are right on the money Fuck me gently with a chain saw do I look like Mother Theresa It s just one good line after another The school s reaction to the mass suicides is hysterical this makes FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH look like THE WONDER YEARS Lehmann and Waters treat Westerburg High like an anthropology case study detailing dominance relationships sex and group migration The report based on the study however has more of O Donoghue Michael than Darwin in it There are some problems though most of them center around the half hour before the conclusion where the film almost becomes a pedestrian thriller The humor and satire are temporarily muted and we have the usual stalking stalked chase scene albeit taking place underneath a school assembly It s as if the creators weren t sure what to do before the climax where they return to the satiric tone of the rest of the film thankfully and filled it in with a standard suspense sequence with some humorous touches The whole cast is good adding to the characterizations of an excellent script with expansive performances Christian Slater seems to have decided to imitate Jack Nicholson at 18 he s pretty good at that and it gets distracting at times but it limits his performance without hurting it Daniel Waters the writer was at the performance and mentioned that the psuedo Nicholson tone was Slater s idea Water s disliked it but it appealed to Lehmann so it stayed Ryder is the standout in a performance that is three dimensional yet slips right in with the film s satiric tone Other satiric comedies at the festival either tried mixing satire with drama and failed YEN FAMILY CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL or stuck to just satire SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS HEATHERS attempted and for the most part succeeded with both making it one of the strongest comic films of the year Side note I wished I d taped Water s comments as he is about as amusing as you would expect from the writer of HEATHERS His description of almost selling the project to Disney was worth the price of admission
0667,Stepfather II,1989,First the Phantom must apologize for leaving his phans in the lurch these past three weeks STEPFATHER 2 was released almost two weeks ago and it was only the bad taste left in the Phantom s mouth by seeing Robert Englund portray his namesake in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that prevented him from attending STEPFATHER 2 on opening night Because PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is in the Phantom s opinion a complete waste of time he refers his phans to Mark Leeper s review for details as well as reasons why it should be avoided even after it hits your local Blockbusters But the good news is that STEPFATHER 2 is as good as PHANTOM was bad For those who haven t seen the original STEPFATHER you should make a special point of picking it up on video Even the usually stingy Leonard Maltin gives it three stars in the Phantom s opinion it s really worth four he thinks it s in the same league as THE HAUNTING and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS Both the original STEPFATHER and the current sequel are based on a character who on the surface is the perfect husband and father a Mr Rogers who can cook and teach little Timmy how to play ball Perfect that is until things don t go according to his very strict and exact plans Then well the Phantom is sure you can conjure up the scenario But STEPFATHER 2 is not a splatter film although there are some bloody scenes it s really more of a thriller than a run of the mill slash and trash film And what a very good thriller it is After a somewhat slow opening set in a mental hospital the pace really picks up and the Phantom found himself completely absorbed in the story Although STEPFATHER 2 suffers to some small degree from sequelitis and although the director Jeff Burr does not have the same light touch and feel for atmospherics as did Joseph Ruben the director of the original who most recently was involved with TRUE BELIEVER STEPFATHER 2 works well both as a sequel and as a film in its own right There s no need to see the original to understand the plot of the sequel and in fact those who see the current installment before renting the original will most likely enjoy it even more since they won t be able to compare it to its admittedly more able predecessor The plot of STEPFATHER 2 will be familiar to those who have seen the original After escaping from the mental hospital in which he s been serving his sentence for the grisly results of the first film our friendly domestic fiend moves to southern California and sets up practice as a psychiatrist specializing in group counseling for women how very convenient He also very conveniently moves in across the street from a recent widow and her son and spends the majority of the film ingratiating himself with them and finally marrying and becoming a stepfather yet again Lest the Phantom make all this out to be routine and predictable he should say that while the plot of STEPFATHER 2 is simple as was the plot of the first it is very well executed and usually stays a step ahead of its audience no mean trick when everyone knows the film s outcome even before buying their popcorn It is also refreshing to see that a horror film can be made without having to rely on artificial plot twists and unbelievable actions after SHOCKER the Phantom had his doubts The acting dialogue and cinematography are all quite good and Terry O Quinn s performance as the stepfather is a standout his screen presence is once again very disturbing and in fact he seems as born to this role as Anthony Perkins is to playing Norman Bates As an added bonus Jim Manzie s score is excellent and adds noticeably to the suspense throughout the film A good score can sometimes save a terrible film but it will always enhance a good one and with STEPFATHER 2 as with HALLOWEEN the latter is most definitely the case What more can the Phantom say He paid full price and doesn t regret it truly what more glowing tribute could there be Take time and see this one while it s still playing at a theater near you before its effect is reduced to 19 and it has to compete with your answering machine The Phantom also urges any of his phans who may have missed the original to rush out to their local Blockbusters and rent it it is truly a classic although even its most generous phan would have to call it a little known sleeper And to those who missed STEPFATHER 2 because of the Phantom s rather tardy review he apologizes profusely and sentences himself to watching all 97 FRIDAY THE 13TH sequels one after the other until he is reduced to an quivering inarticulate knee jerk social critic Then he ll be ready to write articles about the great human cost of horror films and their effect on our children and on our society for the Sunday New York Times Arts and Leisure section Even Clive Barker couldn t dream up a more agonizing punishment
0670,Dr. Caligari,1989,Synopsis The granddaughter of Dr Caligari THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI runs a fashionable psychiatric clinic There she conducts experiments on her patients which include a nymphomaniac and a cannibalistic mass murderer At times surrealistic at times relatively funny this is a generally very poor midnight movie First note that this is a new U S film and it is not a sequel to the famous 1919 German silent film THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI The only thing it shares with the German film is the name of Dr Caligari Instead this is a very low budget film that tries to be a cult film and could succeed The film is by Stephen Sayadian the Director of CAFE FLESH The plot line is fairly simple Dr Caligari works at the Caligari Insane Asylum referred to in the film as the CIA There she is continuing her grandfather s research on the hypothalmus gland a part of the brain that controls all primal urges including sex her special interest Her patients include a nymphomaniac housewife and a cannibalistic mass murderer who enjoys shock therapy The daughter and son in law of the clinic director also work at the clinic and oppose Caligari s plans and her use of patients as experimental subjects Together they try to stop Dr Caligari All of the action in the film takes place in a neon day glow sort of fantasy world That is to say that the set designs are fairly imaginative The problem is that they also look very cheap i e extremely low budget The dialogue is pretty poor a deliberate attempt at campiness that frequently fails The acting is strange for the actors make deliberate stylistic movements and exaggerated gestures while speaking Although the film has its funny moments there are very few of them Thus the film fails to be funny something that is required of midnight movies Given the other limitations of the film I would not recommend seeing it Distribution Being screened at a limited number of theaters in the U S Here in Berkeley it is shown weekly as a midnight movie
0671,I Know Where Im Going!,1945,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival I KNOW WHERE I M GOING Great Britain 1945 Director Producer Screenwriters Michael Powell and Eric Pressburger The Archers Cast Wendy Hiller Roger Livesey Pamela Brown Finlay Currie Capt C W R Knight Petula Clark Valentine Dyall Nancy Price John Laurie Jean Cadell Part of the TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL POWELL series One of the first films that Powell Pressburger produced under their Archers emblem this is a romantic comedy that works very well due mainly to casting of both major and minor roles and a decent script It also attempts to capture a magical Scottish atmosphere in the bargain it s a respectable attempt but it only seems to ferment at the very end of the picture However there is enough good work going on elsewhere in the picture to leave a satisfying taste in one s mouth throughout its running time Wendy Hiller plays Joan Webster a strong materialistic woman who has finally manipulated her millionaire boss into marriage before leaving for Scotland to meet her fiance Joan describes to her father how everything in her life is going exactly as she had planned it to and that this is the culmination of her dreams Her father warns her that the best things in life are often the ones which aren t planned and of course he turns out to be right by the end of the film Fathers always are in films like this While waiting to get across the loch to the island castle owned by her fiance Joan meets a brace of eccentric characters who live in the area including Roger Livesey as Torquil the local laird who has just returned from the war The two begin to fall in love with Joan s dreams of financial independence hindering and the awful weather over the loch helping the budding relationship The varied personalities and activities of the locals along with the ruins of a castle and its ancient curse on Torquil keep I KNOW WHERE I M GOING from having any bare spots and the performances of Hiller and Livesey make for a very fine romance indeed According to Maltin this isn t out on video yet however with the continued interest in Powell Pressburger s work it may not be long before it is available A solid romantic comedy with a bit more emphasis on the romance than the comedy and a feel distinctly different than say Capra or Lubitsch Bias Disclaimer I think Wendy Hiller was born to play Dorothy L Sayers Harriet Vane and I really haven t seen anyone else who s come close
0672,Canterbury Tale A,1944,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival A CANTERBURY TALE Great Britain 1944 Directors Producers Screenwriters The Archers Michael Powell and Eric Pressburger Cast Eric Portman Sheilla Sim Sgt John Sweet Dennis Price Esmond Knight Charles Hawtrey Hay Petrie Part of the TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL POWELL series I start this review with some trepidation because of all of the films done by The Archers this may well be my favorite which is saying something considering they also produced wrote and directed THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH and BLACK NARCISSUS and the reasons are difficult to encapsulate into rigid paragraphs Alright let s try the trilogy angle If you view Powell Pressburger s other great wartime movies as propaganda films which is sifting some very fine cinema to one particular and not especially flattering element you could see 49TH PARALLEL as the Know Your Enemy component it views a group of fugitive Nazis traveling through Canada comparing their philosophy and motives against those of Canadians TBRL To Be Reviewed Later THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP was both a affectionate character sketch with some wonderful moments and a pointed slap about the realities of the Second World War when compared to previous wars Britain had fought in TBRL A CANTERBURY TALE could almost be considered the third element the Why We Fight feature a bit like THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE turned sideways and taken before the end of the war instead of after it And it s more subtle than that too dealing as much with ideals and traditions as it does with the personal aspects of the war The film opens with a brief recreation of Chaucer s Canterbury Pilgrimage on the Pilgrim s Way segueing into wartime England via a hunting falcon which becomes a diving Spitfire Three people have come to a small village on the Pilgrim s Way One Sheila Sim is a city raised Woman s Corps farm worker taking the place of local farm workers who have been enlisted into the Armed Forces Her fiancee a pilot was lost in action several months earlier the idyllic Canterbury countryside seemingly isolated from the war despite blackouts and the occasional war game begins to restore her interest in life after the loss of her lover A second Dennis Price is a musician a university trained organist who found himself working in movie houses before war broke out He is somewhat bitter about where his life has brought him and cynical about the war and its eventual effects on England The last is an American private John Sweet from Oregon on a week s leave to visit Canterbury and the Pilgrim s Way not to mention getting his mind off an absence of letters from his girlfriend The three meet on a train and become involved in a local mystery a prankster called the Glue Man who pours glue in women s hair Interested in the stories of the Pilgrim s Way as related by a local squire Eric Portman they travel around the country surrounding Canterbury ostentatiously to discover the identity of the Glue Man but ultimately to lose themselves in the history and beauty of the area They finally become companions on a weekend trip to the Great Cathedral of Canterbury at the end of their pilgrimage they are given an opportunity to see their lives in perspective to their hopes and to their fellow pilgrims in this and previous eras Spiritual messages rarely come off well in film they re either laid on with heavy handed imagery or are so ephemeral that they get lost under the tread of the rest of the film A CANTERBURY TALE avoids this nimbly it appears to be uncovering its message in the beautiful footage of the countryside and its people rather than implying it Powell grew up in this area and he uses the images of his childhood to infer much of what he loves best about his country If Olivier s HENRY V was a belated battle cry to spur the British to war then conversely A CANTERBURY TALE is something of a visual encapsulation of Shakespeare s This England speech from RICHARD II One might think of A CANTERBURY TALE as a reminder of one the better aspects of civilization the quest for knowledge and self awareness made in an era when these things seemed eclipsed by the threats of invasion and fascism It is subtle when compared with most Home Front movies of the time Halliwell usually a great fan of The Archers in general seems confused by what they were shooting for in this film and indeed perhaps it has found a resonant chord with this reviewer which will not be commonly repeated But personally it is a special film both in the perspective of a wartime picture and in its calm reflective nature within the eye of the hurricane It certainly rates with the best The Archers produced perhaps this newly restored full length print of the film will be made available to video companies in the near future
0673,Chorus of Disapproval A,1988,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL Great Britain 1989 Director Producer Michael Winner Screenwriter Alan Ayckbourn and Michael Winner from the play by Ayckbourn Cast Jeremy Irons Anthony Hopkins Jenny Seagrove Prunella Scales Lionel Jeffries Richard Briers Patsy Kensit Alexandra Pigg Rambling comedies with eccentric characters have been very much in vogue within the independent cinema over the last decade and indeed some very good work has been done with this kind of premise A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL is not one of them It opens with a very shy widower Irons who has been moved to a British seaside town by his company deciding to start a social life again He comes upon an ad in the local paper about a volunteer production of The Beggar s Opera looking for players and decides that this will be the means for his reentry into a social life The cast of The Beggar s Opera is a collection of characters from all social and financial strata most of them rather strident the only really enjoyable one is the director played by Anthony Hopkins with hearty grouchy malice Irons starts out with a bit role but due to either illness on the part of a cast member or bad blood between actors he finds himself moving into better and better roles At the same time Iron s personality begins to change as he takes on bigger more challenging parts he becomes more self confident more charming and more manipulative of the people he s working with He also starts affairs with two of the company one of them being Hopkin s wife The dilemmas this creates throw Irons back and forth between the Garrison Keillor side of his personality and his star side and several levels in between This isn t new ground for a film but that doesn t matter the point is really that it isn t very funny The dialogue is fairly flat and the characters never take on any real dimension except for Hopkins if it was meant to be more of a drama than a comedy then the characters need added dimension It ends with no surprise just a wry side glance at the acting profession and those who work in it The trouble is the events of A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL presented the way they are are hardly worth a side glance in the first place
0674,Earth Girls Are Easy,1989,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY USA 1988 Director Julian Temple Screenwriters Julie Brown Charlie Coffey Terrance E McNally Cast Gena Davis Jeff Goldblum Julie Brown Jim Carrey Damon Waylans Michael McKean Charles Rocket As Dennis Miller might say Hey what can I tell ya You got your horny aliens from outer space who once they ve had the Nair treatment look just like humans You got your attractive pleasant somewhat naive hairdresser who s looking for Mr Right You ve got that mythical plastic Southern California Suburban World of beaches bimbos and blondes to let the cast play around with And you ve got 45 minutes of the old gotta keep the nice aliens from being discovered theme which was getting stale back when Bill Bixby hadn t even thought about having a weekly green steroid treatment What do YOU think is going to happen Well you re right Outside of some of Julie Brown s bouncy pop tunes there isn t much here to entertain There s certainly no surprises I found about two jokes funny and a nice shot which is FLY inspired and the scenes with Goldblum head alien and romantic love interest of Davis character and I guess Davis and company learning Earth customs is a pale retread of other pale retreads I can remember the one part I enjoyed the prosthetic tongue scene simply because it stood out among such a completely familiar background Goldblum looks a little uncomfortable even for a space alien in California Davis holds up well and you end up hoping that she and Goldblum had a good time working together again Charles Rocket plays his usual role as the yuppie rotter he must be sorry that MOONLIGHTING is gone as it appears to be the only place he ever got to stretch his talents some The only thing I really enjoyed about the film were the opening credits you d think they were done by Pee wee Herman the art direction and the old SF props masks suits that they got out for Davis dream sequence Other than that yawn I have the feeling that the director and screenwriters saw HAIRSPRAY and thought they were working at something similar here They aren t HAIRSPRAY is an immensely well crafted film that balances its elements with exceptional precision and comes out with a film that is parody satire AND an actual teen film at the same time This film just reminds you of how many comic alien films you ve seen before and that while you might like Julie Brown s songs at least they re over in five minutes
0675,Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat,1989,Seen at the Seattle International Film Festival SUNDOWN The Vampire in Retreat US 1989 WORLD PREMIERE Director Anthony Hickox Screenwriters John Burgess and Anthony Hickox Cast David Carradine Maxwell Caulfield Bruce Campbell Deborah Foreman M Emmet Walsh Morgan Brittany Marion Eaton John Ireland When on the subject of unsung quality film work I like to bring up a rather unlikely name David Carradine No I m not some zoned out KUNG FU groupie who thinks TV peaked with Carradine muttering earnestly while kicking the royal whatsis out of unthinking Old West bigots cattle barons rich guys with an attitude In Slo Mo You must learn the way of peace WHAP Say that Chinaman just stuck his ankle through Zeke s forehead Yeah in slow motion Real artistic like Where s Peckinpah he d appreciate this I say we ALL attack the Chinaman but one on one instead of in a group And without weapons WHAP WHAP WHAP No I m talking film not that backwater medium called television Because when the name David Carradine is found on any B movie over the last decade you can be sure that magic is just around the corner Remember DEATH RACE 2000 Paul Bartell Roger Corman David Carradine Mary Woronov Sly Stallone Congressman Fred Grandy Gives you hot flashes just thinking about it eh LONE WOLF McQUADE Who can forget Chuck Norris propelling his mighty four wheel

BTW outside of vast mutual respect the other B Movie lucky rabbit s foot e g THE STUFF TROLL together on the same screen with a very bad stop animation Ghidrah Special Bonus Richard Roundtree No Shaft sized gun though So you can well imagine my expectations when I saw Carradine s name heading up SUNDOWN and for at least once this summer my high expectations were exceeded This is one heckuva lotta fun and clever to boot It s advertised as the first Vampire Western Comedy and I ll be damned if it doesn t deliver in the best tongue through cheek B Movie tradition I m not giving away anything by describing the initial plot set up it s plastered on the screen before the opening titles in STAR WARS fashion to a wonderfully overblown Western theme by Richard Stone By the end of this decade many of the vampires in the world are tired of killing and in turn being hunted by humans The visionary vampire Count Mardulak Carradine believes that vampires and humans can live in peace and has gathered many of his brethren up and taken them to a small ghost town in the American West There with the help of sunblock UVH protected glass and artificial blood produced from a local plant the vampires are trying to live a peaceful if somewhat isolated existence with the hope of someday walking the earth side by side with man HOWEVER you knew that was coming right some of the vampires led by Fundamentalist Vampire John Ireland and scientist Max Caulfield believe that this artificial blood stuff which looks kinda like vanilla Yoo Hoo is for weenies and start an underground Right To Bite movement There s a problem at the artificial blood plant and biochemist Bruce Campbell the inventor of the process he thinks its being used for leukemia patients has been invited to visit the plant by Mardulak and find out what s wrong Deciding to make it a working holiday Campbell brings his picture perfect family with wife Morgan Brittany and their two daughters with him in the station wagon but hey Turns out Brittany dumped Caulfield for Campbell and he s still got the hots for her Well you get the picture Pretty soon you ve got a Sergio Leone war between Carradine s and Ireland s forces with Campbell and family in the middle We re talking cinema milestones here folks A vampire mob scene Vampires on horses Sergio Leone gunfights A stretch Caddy with vampire bodyguards David Carradine gives a speech right out of a Frank Capra movie about refraining from drinking human blood A nice little old vampire couple M Emmet Walsh decapitating an obnoxious Porsche driver Note for squeamish fans that s as bad as it gets this isn t a gore film Pretty darn good vampire bat transformation scenes and stop action bats Up there with THE HOWLING anyway More rousing Silverado type western music A vampire yelling Let s saddle up and RIDE There s a lot of funny stuff here not just camp humor but clever material Though it goes down better at a midnight movie that s what it was designed as I think There s also some admirable story continuity as the vampire legends are nicely supported and enforced throughout the plot Standout performances by Carradine who knows just when to drop the serious lines and play to the camera and M Emmet Walsh as a crotchety old vampire who is trying really hard to stay on his diet I don t know if this went straight to video it s released by Vestron which appears to at least be making quality B pictures out these days instead of crap like MIDNIGHT CROSSING that they brought to last year s festival But it s definitely worth your SUNDOWN was some of the best fun I ve had in a movie theater this year Definitely recommended with special Best Fun at the Festival awarded by Yours Truly
0677,Back to the Future Part II,1989,Don t worry kids no real spoilers lurk within Actually about the only spoiler that I will reveal about BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II is the fact that the story is left with a cliff hanger of an ending and is continued in BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III coming to a Sequel Auditorium near you next summer I remember people walking out of the LORD OF THE RINGS in an extremely peeved mood due to the annoying surprise that the film only covered half of Tolkien s trilogy I wouldn t have that on my snow white conscience so Happy Holidays Now you can go prepared I must admit that I didn t hear too much grumbling on leaving BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II I assume the knowledge of it being continued is either fairly common knowledge or the film is more satisfying that LORD OF THE RINGS installment or no A rather back handed compliment So how is it And of course the really original question how does is stand up to its predecessor Well first of all the high points of BACK TO THE FUTURE were a a clever use of time travel machinations many already familiar to me through the wonders of science fiction and comix b Christopher Lloyd s Doc Brown c some cute humor and d Alan Silvestri s charged up theme music And I liked the car However the characters were mostly pastiches keeping it at the level of an above average exercise in comic plotting with an under used plot device time travel A satisfying movie but not something I was anxious to see over and over Thus I have to say that BACK TO THE FUTURE II pretty well meets up to my expectations because they weren t abnormally high in the first place The cleverness and time related in jokes are pretty good and the time travel theme holds together if you don t think about it too closely See assorted heaps of rec arts movies articles for examples of intense chrono temporal reflection No real plot shocks or surprises There s a sense of rushed urgency in this film that was absent in the first BACK TO THE FUTURE film and this gives the film an edge or at least becomes reminiscent enough of IT S A WONDERFUL LIFE to simulate one however what it adds in suspense in takes away from the one enjoyable friendship in the first film the one between Doc Brown and Marty Doc seems to be in the picture merely to hustle Marty from time period to time period and except for one pleasant sequence where Brown bumps into himself gets to show very little personality his main contributions to the film are the better historical jokes From the previews of Part III at the end of the film this may be remedied in the concluding film Michael J Fox seems to be trying to beat Cary Grant s record of double takes in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE and while he s adequate he s no Archie Leech The idea of Cary Grant as the protagonist in a slightly altered version of these films really appeals to me Everyone else is a cookie cutout character Biff especially they also toil who only serve the plot etc So is it worth seeing Depends how well you liked the original BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II is more of the same the good news in these sequel riddled days is it s not worse than the same
0678,Little Mermaid The,1989,These days the press likes to hype the comeback trail for just about anyone politicians celebrities musicians and even companies Obviously Disney has over the last ten years shown a mighty resurgence in the fiscal arena with the success of Touchstone Pictures and it s various amusement parks However those looking at the quality of Disney s recent films will find even more hopeful signs particularly those who fondly remember the animated features of bygone days It appears that someone in the upper echelons has taken the cuffs off the Disney animators and told them to knock his or her socks off After seeing THE LITTLE MERMAID I d guess you d find have to hunt for their shoes somewhere in their secretary s office A step back I really sat up and took notice when THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE came out from Disney a couple of years ago It was an extremely entertaining feature with a good sense of visual ingenuity a fine comic sense and a script that was enjoyable for both kids and adults Being a Holmes fan I realized bias but it really was head and shoulders above the fairly listless cut out animated features that started in the late sixties after but not including THE JUNGLE BOOK and dominated the 70s and early 80s right through the extremely over hyped THE BLACK CAULDRON THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE wasn t as technically accomplished as anything in Disney s Golden Age PINOCCHIO SNOW WHITE FANTASIA etc but it was a solid production and something to keep one s eyes open for Well you won t have to squint to notice the quality to be found in THE LITTLE MERMAID This is I believe the best Disney animated feature since THE JUNGLE BOOK certainly the best animated musical adventure since TJB technically however it s the best thing to come out of Disney s animations studios in decades showing a sense of visual imagination that I haven t seen since Disney s pictures in the early 50s There are sequences that surprised me dazzled me made me laugh with surprise in how the animators had orchestrated the scene and two of the musical numbers literally made me want to applaud after they were over The munchkins next to me would have taken it as a sign of weakness though so next time I m listening to A Voice of Reason and seeing this at 9 30 past most of the little delinquents bedtimes The technical bits were damn impressive while not being up to the standards of a PINOCCHIO it did have sequences which stand out as way above average For the kids for those who enjoy animated features or musicals and for the animation aficionado THE LITTLE MERMAID is a treat VISUAL IMAGINATION The well just does NOT run dry The opening credits the introduction of the characters right down to the point of view of each shot After THE LITTLE MERMAID you d think Disney Studios had forgotten how to do a two dimensional shot The intro of the Sea Witch is particularly good as is the opening credits of a ship at sea But the sparks really fly in the musical numbers particularly the very amusing Kiss the Girl and Under the Sea which honest to God should be released as a music video it d end the glut of black and white monstrosities on MTV single handedly And the old tried and true cartoon humor is in full evidence which is a welcome sight it seemed for a while that someone at Disney had forgotten that this was an art form in itself Looking at Saturday morning TV perhaps a lost one There is no single element more important to an animated film than the whimsy to out think the audience and surprise them with what the film makers are about to do The lights are apparently burning brightly at Disney Studios TECHNICAL In a phrase Nothing Looks Cheap You d be hard pressed to associate this film with the company that made THE ARISTOCATS which brimmed with single dimension animation static backgrounds and strictly two dimensional action There must have been a large sign up somewhere in THE LITTLE MERMAID S production studio USE THE Z AXIS And there are little touches everywhere I particularly liked the light waves against the sea floor But more than that this are several distinct styles in the artwork and animated sequences in this film Many of the characters have the standard Disney character look i e the humans in 101 Dalmatians The Prince his steward etc But they have more texture more distinctiveness Ariel the mermaid in particular comes of with a visual individuality Then there are the early sequences and the introduction of the Sea Witch I want to see it again but I could swear that I was looking at SNOW WHITE level animation almost cel painting Gorgeous stuff somebody opened their pocketbook for this one Finally as in THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE computer animation is integrated into the film very smoothly mostly the wooden ships I think I d be curious to know if it was used in other places Really this is a technological milestone for Disney They ve gained a lot of ground back with THE LITTLE MERMAID and I hope the box office on the film is good enough for them to try it again CHARACTERIZATION Good up to snuff if not great I m very partial to Sebastian the composer crab who is one of Ariel s companions myself but most are standard roles e g Flounder heroine s best friend but there are several other smaller roles which come off very well Most of the voices while familiar to animated film fans aren t celebrity voices with the exception of Buddy Hackett who s animized into a seagull I half expected him to be living in a beached rusted Volkswagen Beetle Rene Auberjonois was also distinctive in his small role as the French chef during Les Poissons probably the shows best comedy sequence Though I kept thinking how much fun it would have been if John Cleese had been doing his Of course I m French Why do you zink I have dis ouutraaaageous Frentch Ak zant voice for it Never satisfied The Sea Witch has all the good lines and lyrics but then Disney villainesses always do And Ariel herself is a strong central character a very pleasant and long overdue change from those helpless Disney females who cling to the hero s arm while he kills the villainess She s certainly the most appealing heroine I ve ever seen in a Disney film though she doesn t break any Disney Heroine Regulations I think The Prince is the usual Disney good looking happy hunk he basically plays with his dog and battles sorceresses Looks like a pipe smoker to me MUSIC Pretty catchy stuff Upon walking out of THE JUNGLE BOOK at age 7 I immediately initiated a campaign to coerce my parents into buying me a record with The Bear Necessities on it remember Ralphie and the B B gun in A CHRISTMAS STORY after the inevitable success I could whine with the best of them back then I played that song over and over again until everyone except me was sick of it Under the Sea is just about as appealing though the lyrics are nothing special and I think a lot of the appeal rests in seeing the animated sequence AND listening to the music at the same time Luckily for my parents I know have enough money to buy the CD Pet gripe they might list the voice talents for the songs in the soundtrack brochure That s Disney corporate policy all over the credits say DISNEY first and everyone else in a 2 point font DIALOGUE AND PLOT Pretty standard stuff though we have the heroine doing most of the rescuing here Outside of that nothing special the one thing this film doesn t surpass THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE in is script which had an almost constant stream of good lines SO Damn good film worth seeing once and for people like me twice Kids Well there were some crying toddlers as the villainess looks pretty nasty at points and there is a shark Nothing worse than the usual Disney Nasty Person Trappings though Besides it s good for the little buggers Gets those psychological complexes started early so they can be in therapy by the time they re in high school I mean I saw the Wicked Queen s transformation scene in SNOW WHITE and it didn t screw me up any did it Outside of possible subliminal pro drug messages Anyway either use the kids as an excuse or better yet catch the late show with your SO Good animated features can make anyone into either a kid or a romantic and THE LITTLE MERMAID is an express ride to either
0679,She-Devil,1989,SHE DEVIL is the new comedy starring Roseanne Barr Meryl Streep and Ed Begley Jr It s about a frumpy housewife Barr who loses her husband Begley to a glamorous romance novelist Streep She vows to get her revenge on her straying hubby which is what the rest of the movie is about It s a fairly dark piece and although in general I enjoy dark humor I found it to be unsatisfying Point number one is that the laughs were too few and far between If the audienced laughed loudly at some bits it was only because there was little to laugh at in between Point number two The story is also fundamentally unsatisfying because it is unsympathetic While Barr s character was certainly wronged the level of her revenge and the basic mean spiritedness of the response so overwhelm the story that both humor and sympathy are crushed beneath its heavy heel There is really no one to root for in SHE DEVIL although in the final analysis it seems that Begley and Streep are the ones who were wronged On the performance side I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by both Streep and Barr Streep demonstrated a certain flair for comedy that I had not suspected although she could clearly use more practice Barr also surprised me more so than Streep in fact because her acting here was quite competent I did not see as I expected any of the Roseanne isms coming through Not once did I feel like she has inserted her schtick into the script If I had to give this movie a grade it d be a C It tries performs fairly well but has fundamentally unsound material to work with I would not personally recommend this movie to most people but if you ve got a hankering for some mean spirited fun or if you love Streep Begley or Barr then give it a go But try to hit it at a bargain
0680,Steel Magnolias,1989,Capsule review Six women go through folly friendship and tragedy together If the basic formula is familiar at least the writing by Robert Harling based on his own stage play is usually crisp and often genuinely funny Rating low 2 STEEL MAGNOLIAS is about as formulaic a women s film as any film I can imagine You have a set of two or more women whom you get to know very well through relatively mundane circumstances You get a feel for what they do in life s more ordinary moments The tragedy usually medical strikes and having known them already you feel for their tragedy Suddenly any old antagonisms seem small But they are stronger for having known each other and the remainder of their numbers will abide and endure That s BEACHES that s TERMS OF ENDEARMENT that s lots of other films and that s STEEL MAGNOLIAS All that makes one of these films good or bad is whether the viewer is really brought into the characters during the normal mundane part and is that part enjoyable In STEEL MAGNOLIAS the mundane part is quite good As it so often is it s not silly or cute or whimsical It is genuinely funny And as such it leaves most of the other films of its formula behind STEEL MAGNOLIAS is the story of six women from a small town in Louisiana The women are played by Sally Field Shirley MacLaine Dolly Parton Daryl Hannah Olympia Dukakis and Julia Roberts Much of the story takes place in a beauty parlor as did all of the play the film was based on But the film greatly benefits from the opportunity to get out of the beauty parlor and see the world There are really three pairs of women a mother and daughter the beauty parlor owner and her assistant and two older women who are often at odds with each other As is almost the requirement for this sort of film there is a soft and sentimental film score by George Delerue Nobody plays these soft and sensitive strings like Delerue Also reasonably good but obviously of secondary interest are the men played by Tom Skerritt Sam Shepard and a few others Also this film boasts a view of the most revolting cake ever baked STEEL MAGNOLIAS obviously has a good cast and is diverting and enjoyable I rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0681,Little Mermaid The,1989,Capsule review Disney Studios is clearly trying to create a classic for multiple re releases by repeating the formula of some of Disney s most successful animated features They probably have succeeded Rating high 1 Walt Disney Studios built their reputation on animation first with Mickey Mouse cartoons and later with their full length animated features Even among their feature length animated films some seem to be more respected than others The real classics are SNOW WHITE SLEEPING BEAUTY and CINDERELLA The second ranked ones are those such as PINOCCHIO BAMBI and PETER PAN Then there are the third ranked ones such as THE JUNGLE BOOK THE FOX AND THE HOUND and THE SWORD IN THE STONE The ones best regarded are adaptations of well known German and French fairy tales They each seem to pit a young woman representing the forces of innocence and good against an older woman who represents decadence and evil Often the older woman also represents the forces of witchcraft THE LITTLE MERMAID represents a return not just to the classic tradition but also to the classic formula Disney Studios is faced with the competition of Don Bluth who was bred in the Disney Studios and who left to form his own competitive animation studios much as Walter Lantz did previously Intentionally or not in the holiday season of 1989 we are having the showdown between Disney and Bluth I have not seen Bluth s ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN but general scuttlebutt is that Disney s classic formula has resulted in a much better film than Bluth s source THE LITTLE MERMAID is the story very loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of Ariel a mermaid who is fascinated by the huge ship hulls she sees floating overhead She also has a large collection of half understood human artifacts salvaged from shipwrecks Ariel s fascination with humans is in direct defiance of her father King Triton who wants Ariel to be happy but entirely within the confines of his undersea kingdom He has no interest in the fish eaters who walk on two legs Ariel is a minor departure from the heroines of previous Disney fairy tales in that she is strong willed and intentionally disobedient The film gives her more character than Snow White or Sleeping Beauty Present to tempt Ariel is this film s villainess the sea witch Ursula As Ariel is half girl and half fish so Ursula is an octopus with a corpulent woman growing out of its head one of Disney s oddest looking creatures The songs are by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken who did the music and lyrics for the musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS Their style in both works is more verse dialogue spoken to music than the usual song poetry It is still perfectly pleasant but it is immediately recognizable as being in the same style What is a slight disappointment is that the artwork in THE LITTLE MERMAID is noticeably less detailed than in other Disney classics Each frame of film IS different This is unlike Japanese animation which has very nice artwork but fairly jerky motion with drawings used for three or four frames each But the sketches have less detail so were more economical to draw The result of all this is that in some ways THE LITTLE MERMAID is reminiscent of the best of Disney in some ways in seems the victim of cost cutting It represents an investment in the future by Disney and will probably be released to theaters several times before it is ever sold on cassette This means if it sounds good you should go to see it in a theater That is the only way to see it As for rating I would give THE LITTLE MERMAID a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0682,War of the Roses The,1989,THE WAR OF THE ROSES is the story of the marriage of Oliver and Barbara Rose It tells how they met fell in love married and raised a family But the primary focus of the film is on how the marriage foundered and on the bitter battle between the two as the marriage dissolves and becomes a contest of wills during the divorce The film gives new meaning to the term idiot plot the plot that works only because the main characters are idiots In this case the point of the film repeated over and over by the Roses s lawyer who is telling the story is that the Roses are being idiots They are willing to give up everything they have to be one up on the other They are empty people with an empty marriage who are finally given a cause to live for which turns out to be destroying each other The team of Michael Douglas Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito popular since ROMANCING THE STONE here turn out another comedy But the humor is only a very thin veneer over what is at heart a very black and bleak story verging on a parable of the Middle East or Northern Ireland Perhaps because the story is told mostly from Oliver s point of view he is the more sympathetic of the two principal characters Barbara acts and Oliver reacts when the marriage begins breaking up Barbara attacks and Oliver counter attacks The film builds to one final evening when Oliver becomes angry enough that both are attacking at the same time THE WAR OF THE ROSES is just at an awkward level of style It could have worked better if it were light such as NEIGHBORS or heavier as a serious straight drama As it is it seems like a comic replug of an old made for television movie THE WAR BETWEEN THE TATES Making jokes about this sort of self destructive behavior is too much like making jokes about leukemia There is the germ of a good idea here but it is improperly handled My rating is a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0683,Blaze,1989,Capsule review Not as well hyped as other films this holiday season BLAZE is still a front runner for plaudits with a solid performance by Lolita Davidovitch managing to steal the show from Paul Newman Rating high 2 For a while the most interesting films of the year were released during the summer These days the period with the best films is the winter holiday season so they are fresh in people s minds for Oscar nominations released with very little fanfare BLAZE is certainly a contender BLAZE manages to be a serious film and at the same time delightful not an easy feat History records that Governor Earl Long of Louisiana brother to empire builder Huey Long was himself a crafty politician and an eccentric character Earl risked his career to continue a long standing affair with a notorious stripper Blaze Starr BLAZE is the story of Blaze Starr s career Earl and Blaze s relationship and Louisiana politics The story starts with Blaze played by Lolita Davidovitch leaving the Appalachian hill country and going to New Orleans to find work She is tricked into becoming a stripper but once she gets used to it she becomes a major New Orleans attraction Once she meets the Governor played by Paul Newman they start spending time together At some point unclear this stops being social climbing on Blaze s part and becomes a deeply felt mutually supportive love The wilder and crazier Earl gets the more loyalty Blaze is able to muster At first Earl is enough of a politician to support the rights of blacks and sell it as racism to a constituency that will buy only racism When he can no longer fool the racists he continues to support equality knowing it may be political suicide His political enemies retaliate by using his undeniable eccentricities against him in the press Blaze does not always understand Earl but she unfailingly knows what Earl needs With an actor of Paul Newman s stature acts as eccentrically as Earl Long a virtual unknown of a co star runs the risk of going totally unnoticed That was now what happened at all If anything Davidovitch walked away with the film A Yugoslav by birth and a naturalized Canadian she is convincing as a touch but gentle woman from Appalacia with an ability to hold audience attention that goes beyond her physical attraction Davidovitch had small parts in ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING and THE BIG TOWN but is unlikely to get any more small parts Ron Shelton previously directed BULL DURHAM with good characterization but not such a good story His BLAZE has a better story and gets a rating of a high 2 on the 4 and 4 scale
0685,She-Devil,1989,Last Tuesday and Wednesday night I watched the television adaptation of Fay Weldon s novel THE LIFE AND LOVES OF A SHE DEVIL Friday I saw Susan Seidelman s version of the same story for Orion Pictures The television version took its title directly from the novel the film version abbreviated the title to just SHE DEVIL perhaps causing some confusion with the 1950s science fiction movie of the same title Having seen the two versions so close together and with the television version being about two and a half times as long I will disqualify myself from actually reviewing SHE DEVIL and just discuss the contrasts in the two versions The film is a very pale very weak and almost entirely forgettable rendition of the same story Even now an hour after having seen the film the television version is more immediately memorable Let me say why First the television play had drama comedy and horror story mixed together into whatever proportions seemed right as it went along The film aimed at a market for comedy and always tried to keep the tone light and frothy So right from the start the film was less ambitious than the movie The film had a dream cast for the story It had a popular serious actress Meryl Streep to play Mary a popular television comedienne Roseanne Barr to play Ruth and a number of other good actors The television version had virtual unknowns in the major roles So why was the casting so wrong for the film Because everybody was cast exactly right in the television play for the play s approach Streep could have played Mary Fisher in the television play and done a reasonable job of it The film however had more physical comedy Streep is hardly known for comic roles and she is just not very good with it Julie T Wallace who played Ruth in the television play did not always have to be appealing to the audience She starts out with the personality of a red brick She is large ugly heavy sullen and not outgoing at all Roseanne Barr got popular because she has a bright personality Her weight does not stand in the way of her being basically attractive and charismatic Even at the beginning of the film it is hard to think of her as a loser Thematically Ruth is very much like Stephen King s Carrie White She is a woman who has almost nothing She does not have looks she does not have talent she does not have money The only thing she has is her rage And her rage is enough From her rage she forges the power to destroy her tormentors At least that is how it is in the television play In the film she does not start nearly so low and she falls well short of destroying Bob and Mary The ending for all three is reasonably happy in the film That is how comedies work The television play did not have to worry about box office and could allow itself to be bleak If I had to rate the two versions on the 4 to 4 scale I would give the television play a 2 and the movie a low 0 But I do not trust those ratings because each rating is probably too much affected by the other Let me leave these ratings unofficial and say that the play which runs periodically on the Arts and Entertainment Network IS worth your time to see probably much more than the film
0686,Always,1989,There s something very special about a Steven Spielberg movie starring Richard Dreyfuss Dreyfuss tends to give some of his more thoughtful work and Spielberg tends to give him pretty interesting roles ALWAYS which sounds a lot like an old escapist movie and is in fact based on A Guy Called Joe is just a wonderful engrossing movie A solid 8 on the movie scale The story is simple a pilot who fights fires is killed and is called by Hap Audrey Hepburn to be the guardian angel of a fire pilot in training Before Pete Dreyfuss is killed off there are some terrific fire fighting scenes and a long rowdy night in a bar as we follow Pete his lover Dorinda Holly Hunt and their friend Al John Goodman The chemistry between Dreyfuss and Hunt is great Talking plot in a movie like this is pretty meaningless What counts are the performances and they are uniformly wonderful Goodman continues to be the ultimate support man and is very powerful when he s angry Hunter Dreyfuss and Brad Johnson an incredible hunk who wears glasses even who plays the new fire pilot are great The fire fighting scenes are very exciting The ending was so engrossing that I completely stopped hearing an annoying alarm that was going off in the theater until the credits rolled
0687,Manifesto,1988,Synopsis Set in an undisclosed country in Central Europe in 1920 the film follows the adventures of a beautiful but oversexed young woman Together with her bumbling friends she is involved in a plot to kill the King A sophisticated and very sly comedy which pokes fun at socialism and revolutionaries Very good but I suspect that much of the humor will be missed by most viewers Yugoslavia in English not dubbed color 1988 94 minutes Director Writer Dusan Makavejev This is the latest work by Dusan Makavejev who is best known in the U S for a previous film THE COCA COLA KID The current film is a lighthearted farce a kind of parody of socialism and revolutionaries The plot is rather thin at times but it is funny enough that boredom is unlikely The story follows Svetlana a very beautiful young woman who returns in 1920 to the small town in Central Europe she was born and raised in Based on her behavior one gets the impression that she is afflicted with nymphomania for she proceeds immediately to rekindle old passions and start new ones Svetlana s motivations for returning home are soon made clear The King is soon to visit her hometown and Svetlana is involved in a group of clumsy inept and incompetent revolutionaries who are plotting to murder the King What makes things more interesting is that the King who visits is actually a fake the real King is already in the town working with the police also clumsy and incompetent to try to uncover the revolutionaries Even more interesting the real King is oversexed and has a foot fetish The result of this ridiculous situation is a real comedy of errors which are made in great abundance by all the characters here Much of the humor is a pointed satire of socialism as the police are ridiculed often The police literally hide in practically every closet in this film Another example more subtle is the scene where a political prisoner is put in an insane asylum by the police There he is locked in a large circular wheel The prisoner loves to run in place in the wheel expending great effort and shouting pro socialist slogans all the time The irony of this scene is very nice the man in the wheel works very hard yet produces nothing but political rhetoric Can you think of a better parody of socialism Although I enjoyed the film very much particularly its nice satire of socialism and revolutionaries much of the humor is rather subtle Thus I wonder how much of the humor will be effectively lost on a general audience As to technical aspects the photography much of which was shot on location is beautiful and the acting is really very good Thus I make a conditional recommendation for the movie i e worth seeing if you appreciate subtle satire much of it political Also in case anyone is curious as to why a Yugoslavian film would be made in English the film is a Cannon Golan Globus Production made specifically for the international market Distribution Now in its initial U S run showing at a limited number of theaters probably the art houses Reviewer Thomas E Billings Department of Statistics University of California Berkeley
0688,Family Business,1989,FAMILY BUSINESS stars Sean Connery as an elderly burglar in New York Dustin Hoffman appears as his estranged son Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick as his son The dynamics of the film are complicated Suffice it to say that Connery s character is a professional burglar Hoffman s used to be one as well but gave it up in favor of legitimate business There is a conflict between father and son Broderick is portrayed as a smart kid who mysteriously drops out of a master s degree program to join the family business His father isn t very happy about that but his grandfather is supportive The rest of the movie deals with a caper and the various conflicts among the three men This is a relatively serious movie with good characterizations all around It s the first serious film Connery s been in in a LONG time he tends to favor action adventure films which he invariably shines in Broderick is surprisingly good as the grandson Hoffman s well Hoffman Everyone has a nasty side to himself this isn t a gooey feel good Christmas movie Don t get the impression that this is another THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY which was also a good movie It isn t
0689,Family Business,1989,Sidney Lumet is one of the best of American directors His record includes films such as TWELVE ANGRY MEN FAIL SAFE DOG DAY AFTERNOON and NETWORK It would be hard to match for intensity films such as EQUUS or what may be his most powerful film THE PAWNBROKER But somehow something went very wrong with FAMILY BUSINESS a crazy quilt patchwork that falls apart at the seams The first and most unlikely matching is of Sean Connery Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick as three generations of the same family At least one review tells me the novel that the film was based on has everyone being Irish American If that is true and even if not it represents an appalling sacrifice of credibility for box office appeal The whole story lies under the cloud of this initial foolishness Grandfather Jessie is Irish his son Vito is Sicilian and his grandson Adam is Jewish It was left ambiguous but Jessie s mother may have been Cherokee Jessie is a career criminal who led his son Vito into crime Vito however eventually broke with his father married a Jewish woman ran a meat provision company that he not so secretly hated and raised a Westinghouse scholar Adam Adam however is rebelling from his father and wants to follow his grandfather into crime starting with the unusual robbery of a biological research facility While the film is marketed as having substantial comedy nobody seems to have told director Lumet FAMILT BUSINESS is a crime drama without very much comedy Even then the actors are mismatched since neither Broderick nor Connery is equipped or prepared to match the intensity of a Dustin Hoffman performance Somewhere Lumet seems to have lost control of the theme of the film The film becomes a defense of crime It is full of likable criminals who hawk stolen goods at Irish wakes The nasty people in this film are people who deal in real estate and lawyers and big corporations each of whom is made to look worse than the others Lumet seems to be saying that Adam should go into likable crime because legal professions are all immoral In spite of Hoffman s performance the only aspect that prevents this film from getting a much lower rating I would give this film a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale FAMILY BUSINESS is bad business
0690,Always,1989,Ever since DUEL Spielberg has shown fascination for the mysterious and fantastic for fire and exploding vehicles ALWAYS is a wonderful combination of all of the above The plane fire fighting scenes are gripping full of suspense and just plain wonderfully shot You can almost feel the heat and the smoke the agony of the pilot fighting through the burning forest The explosions and fire far surpass anything in DUEL EMPIRE OF THE SUN or the latest INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE Of course ALWAYS is not just about fire Capitalizing on a clever idea from the original book Richard Dreyfuss gives a wonderful performance of a very human jealous possessive ghost soul with a mission to inspire a young upcoming fire fighter pilot Holly Hunter gives a strong powerful performance and manages to rise above the pressing need to prove herself as a star actress that seemed to dominate her BROADCAST NEWS role She is much more relaxed and shifts easily from strong angry woman to passionate loving and caring ALWAYS is funny too Following the trend of making comedies out of tragic events WAR OF THE ROSES this film manages to use death and parting from your loved ones into a special kind of tear jerking comedy The classic Spielberg fairy tale dimension is ever present allowing you to feel sad and happy simultaneously in a way that only his films do John Goodman one of the more gifted comic actors of today fits perfectly into the role of buddy loving friend and amusing guy In my books Steven Spielberg has yet to come out with a film that is of lasting value a monument in the history of cinema But from the time of DUEL it was obvious that he has the ability and ALWAYS shows that he is beginning to find the way to balance his film making to achieve this desired end See this film you won t regret it
0691,Abschied vom falschen Paradies,1989,Synopsis A Turkish woman is sentenced to six years in a West German prison for murdering her abusive husband She slowly adapts to prison life learns to speak German and looks forward to her future life However problems arise she is to be deported to Turkey where she will be retried and faces a probable death sentence An emotional portrait of a suffering woman rather slow moving at times West Germany English subtitles color 1988 92 minutes Director Writer Tevfik Baser based on the novel Women Who Died Without Having Lived by Salina Scheinhardt This film is a sequel to Tevfik Baser s first film 40 SQUARE METERS IN GERMANY in which a young Turkish woman is kept as a prisoner in a small Hamburg apartment by her abusive paranoid husband who is also Turkish The current film takes up where the first one ends Elif has murdered her husband and is relocated from her apartment prison to a women s prison courtesy of the West German federal government Elif is placed in pre trial detention sort of a solitary confinement where she suffers severe emotional trauma There are flashbacks to her past and she thinks often of her children She doesn t speak German and this isolates her even more Eventually she is tried and sentenced to six years She is moved into a regular cell and she slowly starts to adapt She begins to learn German and makes friends There are two other Turkish women in the prison but they shun Elif so Elif s friends are all German She even finds a man a Turkish prisoner from the men s side of the prison who sees her through the window at night Things start looking up for Elif she starts to think of the future of starting over with a new life in Germany with her children Then she learns that she is to be deported to Turkey where she will be tried again with a death sentence as the likely outcome The story continues from this point On the positive side the emotionalism underlying this film is very strong and the performance by actress Zuhal Olcay as Elif is extremely good On the negative side the photography is poor dark and somewhat fuzzy at times The emotions here are also a negative point Sure Elif s husband was a lout but this does not justify murder She could have run away or divorced him or found some other solution The basic attitude of the film is a bit troubling Here we have a woman who chose to murder her husband and she is portrayed as a heroine Even worse she never shows regret or remorse of any kind for killing her husband The picture of Elif that emerges is of a very troubled woman one who has made wrong choices and is bearing the severe consequences The problem is that this fact may not be noticed because the emphasis is on her suffering Finally the film is very very slow moving especially the last half Thus I would not recommend it to a general audience Fans of melodrama might find it worthwhile though particularly if you remember that the suffering she endures is the result of actions she chose to take Distribution Part of New Cinema from West Germany a collection of recent German films being presented in conjunction with The Museum of Modern Art New York and the Export Union des Deutschen Films Munich print source
0692,Forbidden City U.S.A.,1989,Until last November I had never even heard of the Forbidden City nightclub I didn t know that during the 1940 s there was a cabaret show which featured Asian American jazz singers and tap dancers Their existence wasn t documented in any movie I d seen or books that I d read Until now And I find myself enjoying the movie FORBIDDEN CITY U S A I think Arthur Dong the director succeeded in communicating the feelings that being an Asian American singer and dancer was indeed forbidden in those times Being a jazz singer or a tap dancer just didn t fit the stereotypes of Asian Americans held by American society We were expected to be cooks and launderers One of the dancers Mary recalled being told that the Chinese shouldn t be dancers because they don t have rhythm and are all bow legged Being an entertainer didn t exactly fit the roles that Asian parents envisioned for their children either The women were expected to be dutiful wives and mothers The men were expected to work in their father s businesses If the father was a grocer then the son was also expected to be a grocer A career as a professional crooner or tap dancer was out of the question Or was it The Forbidden City nightclub was packed nightly during the war years GIs who were passing through San Francisco were lured by the sheer novelty of a nightclub which offers all Chinese cabaret acts They arrive expecting something mysterious and exotic What they see is exotic enough I suppose simply because of the ethnic origin of the performers The entertainers saw themselves as Americans Their parents and grand parents and great grandparents may have come from countries in the Far East but they themselves grew up in towns scattered all over the West Coast However they were perceived as foreigners They were given nicknames such as the Chinese Fred Astaire the Chinese Sophie Tucker and the Chinese Frank Sinatra These nicknames belittle the achievements of these performers and reduced them to mere imitations The effect is like calling Connie Chung the Chinese Barbara Walters or I M Pei the Chinese Frank Lloyd Wright The perception that they were outsiders was at times hard to ignore One woman recalled being in a roadshow traveling through Oklahoma and Texas and having people following her around and wanting to touch her just because they had never seen someone of Chinese ancestry before Several other performers in that show recalled something uglier Jim Crow Which restrooms do they go in the one marked black or the one marked white Where do they sit on the bus in the front or in the rear And what would happen if someone decided that they d made a mistake I like this film because I can identify with the experiences of the participants The recurrent theme is the frustration resulting from being denied opportunities in life because of arbitrary stereotypes set by one s society The stereotypes have changed but the problems still exist Today Asian Americans are often lumped together and perceived as the model minority exemplified by the wiz kids and rags to riches stories The stereotypes mask the poverty and somewhat less than spectacular scholastic achievements of new Asian immigrants struggling to get by in urban ghettos such as San Francisco s Tenderloin These same stereotypes have led many Universities to apply quotas on the number of Asians who are accepted because there are too many of us to the point that an Asian student with a 4 0 GPA was denied entry at UC Berkeley FORBIDDEN CITY U S A omitted some aspects of the nightclub business that I was curious about No one talked about whether there was illegal business going there Was there gambling drug dealing prostitution How did these activities affect the careers of the performers How did they feel about their lives after the club closed in 1962 Overall I d say that this film is well worth viewing especially since it s shown for free on PBS as part of the series The American Experience
0693,Steel Magnolias,1989,This is a very frustrating movie to watch You have some wonderful performances Sally Field and Julia Roberts and others that are just so overdone Shirley MacLaine Olympia Dukakis Tom Skerrit that they almost seem to be part of another movie You have characters that make mysterious transformations during the course of the movie like Darryl Hannah and Sam Shepard You have some clumsy sound editing which left half the audience wondering why the other half was laughing I basically liked the movie I laughed more at this movie more than at any movie since EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY Even though I knew how weepy parts of the movie would be I still found myself crying There s a moment after her daughter s funeral when Sally Field suddenly starts reacting with such fury over the death that she reminded me of her performance in SYBIL Maybe that s the problem I never got so involved in the movie that I forgot I was watching a movie In films like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS ALWAYS and SAY ANYTHING I literally forgot I was watching a film at times But here Dolly Parton is playing the same good old girl we ve seen her play in many other movies Ann Wedgeworth is playing another Southern eccentric The movie takes occasional risks Shirley MacLaine has never looked worse but it suits her character perfectly The relationship between Sally Field and Julia Roberts is very complicated but it s also pretty believable I think I d rate the movie about a 7 on the Chuck scale because though it s a flawed movie I found it compelling just the same It s so rare to see the friendships of a number of woman portrayed in a film Someone complained somewhere about the lack of a strong male character anywhere in the picture All I can say is ABOUT TIME
0694,Born on the Fourth of July,1989,Why would anyone want to see this film Sounds like a Springsteen song Some people like Tom Cruise I can understand I paid ASC dues for a while It s not comedy and it s not one of those macho man films but I think there were some people in the audience who thought it might have been This film won t have many repeat attendees It was emotionally draining for a few people It is a long film nearly 2 5 hours A few of the scenes might seem down and out I guess life is kind of like that and as I get older I have tended to get tired of some of the current same as always fare So you might not like this my view I don t know if people want Vietnam films judging from popular expression of support in Panama an irony it happens at the same time I went to see this film because when I was growing up I remember Dad watching the tube and seeing a fellow named Ron Kovic in a wheelchair and my Dad exclaiming That man is a Communist It happened more than once and that was my introduction to The Vietnam Veteran Against the War This film is not for weak stomachs It does not show some aspects of life in a very positive manner values non White races women to a degree Catholicism the VA especially people with handicaps and others we don t treat well Especially the VA I know that from personal experience because I remember spending lots of time at VA hospitals Westwood and Long Beach with my Dad who was a Legionnaire and I was a Son still recall the preamble visiting WWII vets and I know that those and other earlier Vets tended to look down up the Nam vets The obvious comparison is Hal Ashby s COMING HOME This is a different story a real one You can go borrow Kovic s book from a library is it still in print So you can check the deals as I did for Michael Fox s CASUALTIES OF WAR I do not think it is possible to spoil the film by recounting the sequence of events it is a very graphic very visual film I think this is one of the most powerful films of the year It is very similar in tone to Stone s earlier PLATOON incidental music is the same There are no BIG names in this film Tom Berringer and Wilhelm Dafoe from that earlier film appear in this film Berringer as a recruiting sergeant I remember when that happened in my life and Dafoe as another vet in a chair The details are well taken care of perhaps too obvious in attention to having a few long scenes the anti war books before Kovic changed his mind JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT Life Magazines the TV footage oh Stone himself appears as a newscaster interviewing a colonel on the tube Ron Kovic himself is in the film as another wheelchair bound vet This is another one of those male bonding films to use the cliche It does not speak well of fixed roles or how we treat our fellow man A signal the film sends out from the 50s is that it is an honor to give your life for your country the ultimate sacrifice But the film shows that to die is preferable to coming back less than whole These men who returned have made the ultimate sacrifice I don t know how well it will do in the box office in the long run I went to see the film at a nearly full Saturday matinee when I was waiting for a long computer run Do I used Leeper s scale Dare I gave it a 3 Sure May even be a 4 But people like Kovic s mother would question that remember I said that some women do not appear in a favorable light That s Leeper s scale Only time will tell Okay you had your chance that concludes commentary Synopsis follows nothing else Again it s visceral so I don t think I will give any earth shattering thing away The film begins with two boys paying Army Ron on Long Island in 1956 I remember the surplus helmet I had Well done down to throwing the dirt It s the 4th of July Ron s birthday They attend a parade see the soldiers the disabled vets One first notices one of the vets wincing at the sound of firecrackers I never saw anything like that growing up but the parade was well done I ve walked in three or four myself Ron s future sweetheart is shown Not into girls yet It moves to a time when Kennedy is stepping into office the ask not what you country can do for you speech this evoked the only cheer in my audience But Ron s mother is worried about Communism Said many times through the film The next scenes show Ron getting older He s into wrestling and he loses He s working very hard the American dream His mother catches him with a Playboy I am surprised she did not do the equivalent to washing his mouth with soap The group pressure is shown A recruiting team visits He decides to become a Marine His Dad a WWII Vet isn t so sure he should do this not saying why not a strong willed father figure The concept of duty to country was well shown His brother playing Dylan It s too bad the film is as long as it is It would be a great film if it had the training scenes from FULL METAL JACKET at this point but the film now cuts to a beach near the DMZ It s a village they are preparing to check out They open fire early the confusion starts and the pressure of authority command is there Ron on his second tour that part seemed a bit less probable and his men one new check out for friendly casualties They wasted a few The wounds are very graphic there is a way the skin parts on a grazing wound and they show this But then they are under attack The confusion of battle and retreat is well portrayed NVA bullets Looking toward the sun movement Ron shoots It s the new man From Georgia Not a pretty sight The Major denies Ron killed his own man but Ron is feeling it They don t tell you that 10 12 of the casualties of a war are caused by friendly fire explored by a Carol Burnett film of that title Remember that when you see Panama casualty figures Ron is getting a bit frosty his mind is off somewhere else Some months later Ron s squad is advancing on another village The NVA open up Someone gets it thru the head Ron gets his heel blown off but still the fighter he keeps shooting He gets hit Point of view includes getting hauled out This is the only film I know which shows the exit wound as well as an entry wound Ron has a gaping hole in his back The aid station is a nightmare Soldiers dying Just when you thought it was bad The VA hospital is shown as a real nightmare COMING HOME was clean compared to this Ron tries real hard he still has his fighting spirit He s trying to regain the use of his legs when the doctors are telling him no hope When he falls it s a compound fracture on a paraplegic He tragically loses his leg The chair forever now This whole sequence is not for weak stomaches And it forebode more America Love it or Leave He finally goes home Things are different One sleeze peer has gone into business was in college He gets a chance to feel better he s in parade dress and to speak on the 4th from a platform When he gets a memory from a baby crying He can t finish but he runs into an old buddy who has also been there Lost friends are discussed in a way only a Vet can joke about He sees his sweetheart A demonstration Readjustment Blues by John Denver would have been right here Ron is slowly becoming a problem His hair starting to get longer He has a confrontation with a WWII Vet He blows up in front of his Mom Catholicism and his Dad suggests Mexico Down in Mexico he sees other wheelchair bound vets He is killing time Gets into a fight with Dafoe tragic humor at its best What are you going to do Ron He visits the parents of the man he killed Many tokens of past soldiers in the house You can guess for yourself if he tells a story of bravery or the truth A powerful moment The film concludes which Ron a Republican getting into the 1972 Republican convention and disrupting it One of the vets is really an undercover cop trying to get him specifically this really happened The media coverage Then the 1976 Democratic convention His book is out He is home This film would appear a real downer except at the very beginning and end The problem is that many of these people policies attitudes still exist It would be really hard to create an uplifting ending It is a film about principles It is somewhat ironic the film was shot in the Philippines where so much recent blood has been shed One hears a a couple dozen killed in Panama but few remember that over 300 Americans were wounded some by friendly fire some to probably go thru what Kovic did Then what of the 1000 Panamanians What of the millions of Vietnamese Okay so this is commentary Finis
0695,Wizard The,1989,This is a film that deals from the bottom and the top of the deck The top of the deck is the simple story that was outlined above This is almost standard stock fare Two brother go off together feeling unwanted The parents start a frantic search and the young uns meet all sorts of characters as they grow up together and individually There is a crazy escape sequence that leads to the moment of truth and the ultimate loser pulls out the win of the day A general feel good movie as the family is reunited and they live happily ever after From the bottom is a story about dealing with the loss of a family member the guilt feelings that one has about feeling there was something more they could do to stop the death The emotional scars that are raised when one attempt to deal directly with loss is shown dramatically when the two boys are drawn apart by the young lady in the film Only the thought of accepting a personal loss as an individual seems to be able to overcome the fact that the elder boy is sharing his attentions with another The closing scenes no I do not believe in spoilers after the visible victory is the actual victory of the youngest son and the family One has to ask Is this a children s film The answer to that is NO This is a family film It is a film that will have anyone who has ever lost a family member wanting to have just a moment with that person back what made this harder was the fact that I saw ALWAYS immediately after this Talk about a one two punch Overall the acting was above par from that which is normally encountered in children s movies The adults were not all morons although some were and the performances by both Christian Slater and Fred Savage were excellent Savage has truly benefited from his work behind the camera on T V His performance requires a bound of emotions all which her pulls out and shows with effectiveness The direction was bumpy throughout but once you understand that this was a film made for two distinct audiences and that the author and director had something serious to say between the lines of the children s action adventure then you can live with the uneven pacing On the scale of 4 to 4 I would have to give this film a 2 3 rating I provide two ratings for there are actually two films here The first the children s action adventure gets a 2 It was above average in its scope and capabilities It was not excellent but was quite good The 3 goes to the film that underlay the story This is actually a very moving piece that strikes home with anyone who has ever lost a sibling and or watched a family self destruct from the loss of a child or any immediate family member
0696,Philosoph Der,1989,Synopsis A shy clumsy naive and reclusive intellectual a philosopher meets three gorgeous worldly women He falls in love with one of them and moves into an apartment with them Very funny and witty at times corny at other times An amusing film but nothing special West Germany English subtitles color 1988 84 minutes Director Writer Rudolf Thome The plot of this film is rather simple Georg Hermes is a reclusive intellectual who lives in a small shabby apartment His first book a philosophical analysis of some short remnant by Heraclitus has just been published He is to give a reading from the book and he needs a new suit Off he goes to a fancy men s store which happens to be owned by three gorgeous worldly and very sexy women The women like this clumsy innocent intellectual Georg falls in love with one of the women Franziska Soon he moves into the large beautiful apartment shared by the women where they wait on him and spend their time in sex The story continues with the philosophical difficulties Georg faces he loves all three women but feels that he should be faithful to Franziska The humor in this film is very witty something that is rather rare It is often charming but is also corny at times The film is sort of a sophisticated version of those teenage hormone movies where a shy teenager struggles to lose his virginity The difference here is the age and maturity level of the main characters here it is a shy 30 year old intellectual who loses his virginity to a beautiful and worldly woman This has the appearance of being a relatively low budget film There is virtually no background music The acting is adequate although special mention should be made of the superb performance given by Johannes Herrschmann as Georg Hermes Georg is truly the clumsiest most naive nerd imaginable The plot is rather thin and the story really drags at times there are sections of the film that contain little humor This plus the low production values reduces the overall quality of the film Overall rate it as good but not a very good Distribution Part of New Cinema from West Germany a collection of recent German films being presented in conjunction with The Museum of Modern Art New York and the Export Union des Deutschen Films Munich print source
0697,My Left Foot,1989,I recently posted a recommendation for the movie MY LEFT FOOT in misc handicap and received an inquiry from someone on the net who was perplexed about the cryptic newspaper ads for the movie and the lack of explanation about the movie s subject in my posting For those who want to know a little more about the content of the movie before plopping down their money here s the message I sent in reply Christy Brown was born in 1932 in Dublin Ireland As you might guess prenatal and delivery care was lousy for the kids of poor families at that time and there obviously weren t any electronic monitors In fact prenatal care is still lousy for most poor people in Ireland as shown by their rather high incidence of cerebral palsy In the case of Christy s family his mother was pregnant 22 times but only 13 of the children survived Anyway Christy was probably asphyxiated almost to the point of death during labor delivery but survived He survived in a state in which his mind was fully functional but he had very little use of his body only his left foot functioned well enough to allow him any significant control over his environment thus the title Medically he would probably be termed a triplegic With the use of his left foot he eventually became a very good painter and wrote some books among them MY LEFT FOOT There has been another famous writer from Ireland recently who also has CP Christopher Nolan who writes with a headstick wrote a book a couple years back entitled UNDER THE EYE OF THE CLOCK which was widely acclaimed There is nothing glitzy about MY LEFT FOOT but the emotional images are stunning Here are some of them DON T READ THESE BULLETED ITEMS IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO SEE THE MOVIE AND WANT TO BE SURPRISED o As a child he is called a half wit by people who don t understand that he has a bright mind in a disabled body The facial expression which the child actor was able to reproduce was remarkably accurate a look of pain accompanied by a downturned mouth pouting look often seen in children with certain types of CP o As a child he finally makes it known to his parents that a lot is happening in his mind by scratching out the word MOTHER on the floor with chalk held in his left foot o As an adult he is in love with the female doctor who was responsible for much of his rehabilitation but is rejected by her The obvious pain he feels as he tells her that he s tired of platonic love the phrase used in the movie is f k Plato that he s tired of being denied the expression and pleasure of his sexuality simply because his twisted body doesn t work like the average person s is a real choker I doubt that this would be a great movie for everyone I suspect there are some people from the Feeling Good School of Life who would resent the subject material Fact of the matter is I m biased for reasons I don t need to go into here taking that into account I ll simply say that MY LEFT FOOT is the best movie I ve seen in 6 years As I ve said before it puts the glitz of RAINMAN to shame

0699,Glory,1989,Capsule review Excellent Civil War film of the first black regiment and the prejudice they faced At times it seems a little over idealized but no more so than most films about World War II Realistically photographed by Freddie Francis and well acted particularly by Morgan Freeman Rating 2 At a time when Hollywood is simply not making many films set in previous centuries perhaps even the novelty of Edward Zwick s Civil War film GLORY might carry it However Zwick s film goes beyond that to being one of the best Civil War films ever made GLORY tells the story of the U S Army s 54th Massachusetts Regiment the first black regiment in the Army s history The 54th had two enemies it had to fight The Confederate Army was second First they had to fight the Union Army for the privilege of being treated as soldiers From the start the all black regiment with two white officers was an experiment programmed for failure Command was given to Robert Gould Shaw a 23 year old inexperienced at command Further they were criminally under provisioned having to battle the army for such basics as uniforms shoes socks and guns one scene shows a black soldier standing guard duty with a spear They have to fight for provisions they have to fight to be sent to the front and finally they have to fight to fight Their training was by among others an Irish racist who apparently thought that blacks were Hindus In spite of this and in spite of the army cheating them out of their fair salary they distinguished themselves sufficiently to become cannon fodder GLORY is their story Or more accurately it is the story of the white officers who led them and the story of five soldiers who shared the same tent upon enlisting All the other blacks in the film are effectively spear carriers in some cases literally Even given that Colonel Shaw was supposed to be young Matthew Broderick seems a little too boyish for the role He carries too much baggage from previous roles in which he always played the role of the wise guy kid He is a little hard to take seriously as the committed idealist though he does much better in Shaw s moments of self doubt Much better is Morgan Freeman as Rawlins Freeman could easily have carried the film as the main character and as it is he is likely to get an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor as well as a nomination for Best Actor for DRIVING MISS DAISY One of the unsung stars of the film is Freddie Francis director of photography Francis was director of photography on such films as THE INNOCENTS THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT S WOMAN THE ELEPHANT MAN and DUNE Francis is superb at creating a period feel From his visualization of the battle of Antietam the viewer realizes that he is going for authentic feel rather than dramatic effect His view of a Civil War surgery is somewhat harrowing to say the least His photography rounds out the film and makes for a very satisfying view of history My rating is a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0701,Roger & Me,1989,Capsule review A biting documentary about the destruction GM does by closing plants in Flint Michigan It is razor sharp and bitter Moore s film is a compilation of footage he took and pieces from stock footage documentaries television etc Moore rarely has to use narration to tell the audience the point of a sequence the point is clear from the footage he chooses The film has a very effective documentary style Rating high 2 Michael Moore will likely turn out to be a flash in the pan He has a lot to say about a subject he has been intimately involved with but it seems unlikely there is any other subject he will be able to make another film about with such wit and insight But the film he did make may be a real shot in the arm for documentary filmmaking How long has it been since a documentary has made it to first run popular as opposed to art theaters ROGER ME has and with very few overt jokes it is one of the funniest films of the year It seems amazing that by filming a true story as it actually is happening Moore could have come up with a film at once as funny and as sad as ROGER ME but that is the power of the documentary film maker and editor ROGER ME is Moore s funny bitter account of the decline of Flint Michigan due to its plant closings and of Moore s own attempts to interview Roger Smith the chairman of General Motors Smith clearly did not want to be interviewed by Moore and it is easy to understand why Moore s interviews turn everyone he talks to into pate So time after time Smith or people who work for Smith foil Moore s attempts at an interview and they become the film s running gag Happening once or twice it would look like daily business but when Moore is foiled time after time Smith just ends up looking worse and worse And just as surely as we occasionally have national heroes Moore has succeeded in making Roger Smith a national villain But the film is more than just an indictment of Smith or even of the auto industry Moore has captured on film Middle America with every pimple and pore showing He shows hare brained schemes for reviving Flint such as the GM built theme park Autoworld built under the assumption that if GM is in love with cars the whole country is in love with cars It featured a puppet auto worker singing love songs to a robot assembler which Moore notes will replace him GM brought in celebrities such as Pat Boone Anita Bryant and Robert Schuller to spread messages of silly optimism Turn your hurt into a halo Schuller advises with as straight a face as Schuller ever has When people are in real trouble there is little that can be said to make it better and Moore s camera zooms in on the foolishness of trying to fix things up with mere words One woman becomes an Amway distributor and seems to have gone off the deep end on somebody s theory that everybody has a season of color like a zodiac sign and you must get cosmetics and clothing in colors determined by your season of color The theory sounds like Elizabeth Arden meets New Age thinking Another woman goes into raising rabbits for pets or meat and cheerfully kills and flays a rabbit for the camera GM also gets The Newlywed Game s Bob Eubanks who fails from Flint to come to town and tell people how great Flint is While Moore is doing a number on Roger Smith Eubanks is doing a number on himself that could be just as bad While I do not have any particular respect for somebody who is a black belt at karate I can respect a perfectly placed karate kick While I do not always respect Moore s methods his film is a perfectly placed kick to the auto industry and all those who support it This is not fair documentary filmmaking but it is entertaining and it is effective It has precisely the effect on the audience that it was intended to have I would give it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0702,Born on the Fourth of July,1989,While there are a few missteps in the movie the acting is superb I never really considered Tom Cruise an actor until I saw this film Oliver Stone continues building on his reputation as a director who creates visceral gut wrenching movies An 8 or 9 on the Chuck scale BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY is the true story of Ron Kovic a rabble rousing Viet Nam paraplegic and how he got that way The film opens idyllically in the late 50s when little Ronny Kovic is playing soldiers with his friends The action switches to the 4th of July parade where we meet Ronny s ever growing family and Donna the girl who ll break his heart eventually The scenes of Massapequa New York are scenes of a safe home where the greatest danger is Mom finding a Playboy in teenaged Ronny s room As a teenager Ronny is a driven idealist who goes into the Marines right after graduation The action jumps ahead three years and we see Sargeant Kovic an almost hardened soldier Almost immediately there s shooting and death and within fifteen minutes of the film s arrival in Vietnam there s the awful scene of Ron Kovic going down fighting followed by five minutes of hell in the field hospital I couldn t watch most of the field hospital sequences it was some of the most gruesome stuff I d ever seen But it was never gratuitous The audience is as numbed by the gore as Ron Kovic was The next sequences in the Bronx VA hospital are so outrageous that they can only be true Kovic pushes himself and pushes some more and eventually is forced to realize that he ll never walk again He never really accepts that or his experiences in Vietnam and sinks into alcoholism after he returns home to Massapequa A lot goes on in the 2 1 2 hour running time of this movie His conversion to a militant pacifist and vet against the war happens pretty quickly near the end of the movie But Tom Cruise really makes us believe that Ron Kovic spent the first few years of his physical paralysis as a sort of emotional spastic A person who let the world go on so long as he could drink and would only occasionally let the rage show The supporting cast particularly the actors who play Kovic s parents are all fine Willem Dafoe has a great turn as a drugged out paraplegic Kovic meets in Mexico 2 Vietnam looked too much like Mexico That s because Stone shot the Vietnam portions in Mexico Then he chose almost IDENTICAL opening shots incredibly yellow aerial shots of sand dunes to establish both locales Kovic goes to Mexico for some R R 4 Same problem with Donna The movie strongly implies that she s gotten married and she introduces Kovic to anti war protests She also completely disappears from the movie 6 The movie could have been trimmed by about another five minutes with no damage done particularly the murky scene after the very dramatic disruption of the Republican National Convention
0703,Born on the Fourth of July,1989,I just saw BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY I can t find fault with any of the film s messages Its scenes held together okay Technically it was fine However I did not find the film entertaining and it did not emotionally involve me very much It seemed to be more of a collage of scenes from the era than a story The film s one message that the Vietnam war was a mistake was beaten until it was dead I kept waiting for something to happen For the development of any one of the other characters His brother Charlie in Mexico His father His high school sweetheart One of his friends Unfortunately Ron was the only character who we see throughout the film His character development consisted of his change from blind patriotism to his disillusionment with the government Very simple we see it coming it s no big surprise when it happens I haven t read the book the movie s based on perhaps they follow it faithfully which I suppose is a good thing However there s a couple of things I would like to have seen in the movie Individually I thought the scenes were well done and powerful However I wish they would have been tied together into a stronger story The film came off as little more than highlight s of Ron s life and the Vietnam era I left the theater with the feeling that I d already seen the whole movie in the preview and the video on MTV I wish it would have had a more complex message
0704,Talvisota,1989,This is not intended as a review in the usual sense Consider it a sample of the sort of thing that I think would be interesting to see in a newsgroup like rec arts cinema War movies used to be a staple of American and international film They provided an excellent mechanism for combining action with patriotism which fed the studios wallets and the immigrant studio heads nationalism at the same time But war movies died with Vietnam in the U S at least The only war movies one sees today are anti war movies an excellent mechanism for combining action with idealism which feeds the studios wallets and the shallow studio heads superficial sense of social involvement at the same time Things change but not much Anti war movies have a much more limited audience though so not nearly so many of them are made Which makes the chances of seeing three new war movies in a single month rather unlikely None the less I did It helped that two were made outside the U S What is interesting about the experience is that the films covered three different wars from three different periods of history using three different perspectives and had three different themes The up side of the decline of war movies is that they are no longer out there glamorizing war The down side is that war is a powerful catalyst for the artistic impulse and has been a fundamental component in many great artistic masterpieces These three films found three different ways to use the power of war without glorifying it HENRY V is an adaptation of Shakespeare s play about Britain s great warrior king the victor of Agincourt During World War II Olivier used this material to fashion propaganda creating a world of pageantry in which plucky little England overcame tremendous odds to gloriously win a continental war The new version of the film directed by Kenneth Branagh takes a very different view of things The same play edited differently by the two directors provided two different views of war Branagh presents a dynamic young king prodded and duped into fighting a bloody vicious war whose victory is undone within a generation This HENRY V contains no fields of honor and thundering hoards of glistening knights It is full of dirt mud and gloom Despite a decisive victory with small losses Branagh s Henry is a king who has seen the horror of war and is happy to compromise his demands to avoid a return to battle England is a nation led by a duped leader into an unnecessary and horrible war to uphold a dubious territorial claim War here is futile nasty without any redeeming value Branagh furthers his achievement though by presenting the seductive side of war Henry is a tremendous leader of men able to stir and cajole them to unbelievable efforts How many in the audience would not follow Henry into battle after the speech he gives before Agincourt Precious few I think Yet while that battle was forced it was fought in a war that would benefit only the few if anyone at all GLORY is a very different film GLORY directed by Edward Zweig tells the story of the first black regiment to see combat in the American Civil War During that War one of whose major causes was slavery in the Southern states the Union was reluctant to use black soldiers Underlying prejudice against blacks was nearly as widespread and deep in the North as in the South Moreover the South made it very clear that they intended to treat black soldiers and those who fought with them very harshly So despite the intense desire of blacks to participate in the war that would liberate them the Union dragged its heels on using them But the persistence of blacks and the enlightenment of a few white Northerners finally prevailed Black soldiers were recruited trained and eventually used in battle GLORY tells the true story of the first regiment of black soldiers to see battle Their bravery in some hideously deadly combat proved that black soldiers could be just as effective as whites Unlike HENRY V the war in GLORY is necessary and in a destructive way liberating The soldiers in GLORY die in enormous numbers but they die for a reason and their deaths have meaning and value The horror of war is not minimized but the focus of the film is how some men used war for good purposes sacrificing themselves for the benefit of others Not a popular point of view nowadays and only the socially acceptable message of racial equality made this film possible at all TALVISOTA the third film has a more modern setting and is primarily concerned with the destruction of war In 1939 the U S S R invaded Finland with a huge army basically seeking to incorporate it into the Soviet Union or at least to seize strategically important chunks of the country But the Soviets made two important errors they invaded in winter and they underestimated the resolve of the Finns Unprepared for a winter campaign against a determined opponent the Russians took tremendous losses despite equally tremendous numerical superiority and the war was eventually ended Finland had to give up some territory but maintained its independence The few Americans who know of this war tend to view it as a dashing affair carried out on sparkling snow with daring Finnish ski troops encircling lumbering incompetent Soviet units It has a clean surgical image reinforced by clear heros and villains and a situation in which the underdog basically prevailed TALVISOTA smashes that image A Finnish film directed by Pekka Parikan it does not suggest that the Finns were responsible or in the wrong but it makes clear that no modern war has anything of glamour about it TALVISOTA follows a group of Finns who are conscripted to help defend the country Their war is not a matter of swooping down on bumbling Russians but a horror of trench fighting against seemingly endless hoards of enemy troops with intermittent moments of terror as Soviet artillery and aircraft pound them One after another they die suddenly nastily usually with no particular rhyme or reason Charging into the enemy sometimes proves safer than going behind a tree to relieve yourself The soldier next to you can be blown apart while you aren t scratched Every time a man goes out of your sight it might be the last time you ever see him No film I have seen has ever painted as strong a picture of the destructive power of war as does TALVISOTA The film is three harrowing hours of death and explosion Forests are reduced to fields of shattered stumps Men are ground down to the point where they are hardly living at all Death is rarely clean and usually very messy and unpleasant The soldiers are killed their families are torn apart the countryside is destroyed And worst of all the whole awful process is unavoidable Finland didn t want the war didn t ask for the war but could only avoid it by submitting entirely to the enemy TALVISOTA is easily the bleakest of the three films for it shows no redeeming feature of war yet also suggests that the best intentions in the world cannot always allow you to avoid it These three films demonstrate the artistic power of war How could an activity that by its nature involves death on a large scale and the clash of fundamental ideals not be a powerful subject for art The true shame of most war films made during the greatest flood of combat movies is perhaps not that they made war too heroic but that they treated the subject so shallowly with Errol Flynn and company mowing down faceless battalions of Japanese and Germans at no real cost to themselves or even to the enemy Toy soldiers fell over and our side won the game Branagh Zweig and Parikan have artistic visions war as horrible waste war as a terrible but necessary step in liberation war as tragically unavoidable destruction These sorts of war films are important even in times of peace and even to those who oppose war for any purpose They are the cinema s contribution to one of the great issues of all times and are every bit as important as books editorials and speeches This is cinema as art
0705,Spy Smasher Returns,1966,Synopsis Originally released as a serial in 1942 this film presents the adventures of Spy Smasher a hero who runs around wearing a cape and goggles fighting enemy villains and spies Loaded with action but very short on plot it is both ridiculous and funny Good for its time but not up to modern standards for action thriller films U S A black and white 1942 re released 1966 100 minutes Director William Witney This film was originally released as a 12 part serial in 1942 by Republic Pictures It was directed by William Witney who directed a number of other serials including Dick Tracy The Lone Ranger and Daredevils of the Red Circle In 1966 the Spy Smasher serials were re edited to produce this 100 minute movie Similarly the 15 part Dick Tracy serial was re edited to produce the movie DICK TRACY S G MEN The Spy Smasher character came from a comic book Whiz Comics issued in the period 1940 42 An interesting thing about the serial is that it was already in production at the time the U S entered World War II in December 1941 Production was completed in February 1942 making this the first of the patriotic propagandistic serials released during the war This film has lots of action but very little plot The story revolves around a man referred to as Spy Smasher who runs around wearing a cape boots and motorcycle goggles He works for the U S though he is not an official government employee fighting enemies and spies The enemy he is fighting against is some guy called The Mask who wears a sheet over his face At times the Mask reminded me of the unknown comic from the old Gong Show who used to wear a bag over his head Anyway the Mask is a German agent who leads a ring of spies in the U S He operates from a submarine somewhere in the ocean which ocean is not made clear He communicates with his agents via live television link up rather fancy for 1942 He and his agents are involved in various sabotage plans Among the things they attempt are to shoot down bombers with an electric ray gun steal bombsights hijack a gold shipment attack a refinery and so on Spy Smasher is after them or ahead of them the whole time The result is a movie that consists mostly of chases and fights This film should be of interest to film buffs as it represents a genre serials that no longer exist in this form Today s serials are usually television programs or feature length movies As I was watching this film I was impressed with the similarity in style to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK the first Indiana Jones film Both films were full of fights and chases both had Nazis as villains there were submarines in both films etc Of course SPY SMASHER was done in 1942 so the stunts special effects and production values cannot compare with RAIDERS However I suspect that this serial or ones like it may have been part of the inspiration for George Lucas when he developed RAIDERS Because of the low production values and thin plot I would not recommend it to general audiences However I strongly recommend it to film buffs and those with an interest in old time serials Distribution Print source was the collection of Willam K Everson New York University Serials are occasionally shown at repertory theaters and on television However I have no information on whether prints of this film are available for screening
0707,Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,1990,Any film that includes the quote I ll be in hell for breakfast can t be all bad And LEATHERFACE isn t really although it certainly isn t all good either On the other hand the Phantom has been at his wits end recently Christmas is always a bad time of year for him and recently he even resorted to renting SLEEPING BEAUTY again just to see a film any film that gives him the shivers Truthfully the Phantom has yet to find anyone himself included who isn t scared silly by the Evil Queen The Phantom should also point out that he although he is a big fan of the original CHAINSAW he was rather disappointed with its first sequel It just seemed to trivialize what should have been a continuation of one of the most terrifying horror films ever made Even Dennis Hopper turning in one of his most truly lunatic performances couldn t save it So it was with some trepidation that the Phantom purchased his ticket for part 3 LEATHERFACE arrived last week with quite excellent trailers and the catch phrase The most controversial film since something or other The Phantom can t quite remember because although he like every other horror fan heard the rumors about LEATHERFACE s release date being held up pending approval by the MPAA he has to admit that the film is resolutely ordinary and not in the least controversial In fact much of the film plays like the shower scene from SCARFACE except without Al Pacino s outrageous Cuban accent That is although most of the scenes have a violent tone about them you really see very little In fact in the Phantom s opinion LEATHERFACE might even have gotten away with a PG 13 assuming the censors er board members were in a charitable mood that day and that they somehow came to believe that a film about a family of cannibals and chainsaw wielders required only parental guidance More surprisingly although the title and trailers emphasize Leatherface and imply that he s Texas s equivalent of Jason he s really on screen only about half the time The other half is occupied by assorted members of his creepy family a family you phans may remember that has been killed several times over by now In fact the connection between this film and its two predecessors is not quite clear except for the clever real life connection made by the folks at New Line between a familiar name and the guaranteed box office receipts it will generate There is a brief explanation that scrolls across the screen at the beginning of the film this explanation is also read aloud as if in acknowledgment of the likely handicaps of the film s audience but it serves only as an excuse to get things going really it s nothing more than the filmmakers way of winking at the audience and saying We know you like sequels you know you like sequels what do you want us to do come up with an original idea or something The film itself is well directed and edited and is generally suspenseful throughout It s missing some big payoffs and if you expect serious high tech monster gore a la HELLRAISER you ll be disappointed but it has enough little payoffs to make up for its lack of serious violence It even has a few funny moments although Leatherface will never be another Freddy since he doesn t speak he s limited in the kind of material he can do But he s a little more human than Jason if that counts for anything The Phantom also appreciated the feelings of tension and dread the film generated Although things don t really get cooking so to speak until about half way through the beginning of the film is by no means boring or uneventful and much of the film is directed in such a way that you never quite know what s going to happen next The Phantom must admit however that he had his beeper turned on during the film and that his feelings of tension and dread may therefore have had more to do with that than with the action on screen The plot sans spoilers of course will be familiar to anyone who has seen the original a handful of happy go lucky folks get caught out in the middle of Texas lose their way or crash their cars or both and find that the woods hold more than just Smokey the Bear By the way those woods have always intrigued the Phantom in the original CHAINSAW they didn t really seem out of place although in LEATHERFACE we go from highway to scrub land to forest awfully quickly The Phantom blinked and thought the action had shifted to Vermont it was only the Texas drawls and the fact that the woods weren t flowing with sap after Leatherface made a few swipes at the trees that made him realize that no one had left the Lone Star state They meet up with the first family of Texas no not the Bushes and swing axes throw rocks and run away from chainsaws until they finally convene for dinner In fact there s quite a bit of walking and running in this film and there are probably a dozen too many shots of people s legs moving this way and that Perhaps the producers were hoping for Reebok or Nike to cosponsor the film though the only product the Phantom noticed was a can of Diet Pepsi early on Even the fabled chainsaw was generic Think of the missed advertising opportunities here Leatherface could even do endorsements at local True Value hardware stores nationwide Shortly thereafter some number of them escape who escapes the Phantom won t reveal but suffice it to say that anyone who s ever seen a horror film before will be able to guess Or possibly no one escapes the ending is sufficiently dream like to allow for the five minutes of concentrated implausibility that ends the film and of course for the requisite sequel That s the Phantom s best guess anyway He thinks that dreams must have played an important role in the making of LEATHERFACE for certainly the producers were under the impression that it might enjoy the mass market appeal of the original and for them to think that implies either that they were dreaming or that they never bothered to watch the film themselves Still LEATHERFACE is a fun film and never boring and especially in this season of post Christmas letdowns with no new horror fix in the foreseeable future it s worth a look before it hits your local Blockbusters It s a good solid horror film that lacks only in the originality and creativity departments But truthfully the Phantom doubts that anyone could make a really good sequel to the original CHAINSAW and while he wasn t surprised that LEATHERFACE did little more than reprise its more effective and more successful predecessor he will say that it is entertaining enough in its own right to warrant a look For those phans who like to take their film reviews with a dose of relativity the Phantom will say that LEATHERFACE is more enjoyable than either of Jason s or Michael s most recent flicks and that it is less stupid than SHOCKER though less original and less fun as well But he still likes SLEEPING BEAUTY better
0708,Music Box,1990,Capsule review One of 1989 s better films concerns a successful and occasionally unscrupulous lawyer defending her own father against a charge that he collaborated with Nazis and committed war crimes in the Hungarian police during World War II What made the film powerful was not the question of guilt or innocence but the family relationships under stress Rating high 2 It looks as if most of the distinguished films of 1989 waited until year end to be released In the case of MUSIC BOX it seems to have been a miscalculation because the latest from political filmmaker Costa Gavras is getting a very lukewarm reception from critics And that is understandable since the story is predictable Nonetheless I found myself liking the film In spite of the fact that I knew what was going to happen I was anxious to see how it was going to happen and how the main characters would react when it did Jessica Lange plays successful lawyer Ann Talbot She is brought up short however when extradition proceedings are brought against her father for Holocaust atrocities and he insists on having his own daughter defend him at the hearing Her job is made all the more difficult by the opposing counsel s apparent over anxiousness to make an effective case against her father But what is most disturbing is that as she learns more and more of the sadistic war crimes committed by the man her father is accused of being she is better able to visualize her father as being the man described She notices circumstantial similarities She eventually has to decide if she really wants to fight to save her father Costa Gavras of course always has a political message in his films usually at least a bit left of center In this case much of the political message centers around Talbot s father in law who helped find sanctuary for Nazis after the war in an attempt to use them against Communist governments The music was provided by Philippe Sarde and being made up mostly of Hungarian violin music adds a touch of Eastern European atmosphere to the film This will not be considered one of the best Costa Gavras films but I have to say I found it worthwhile I give it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale The next paragraph will contain spoilers I find what I liked about the film was not the suspense of whether Talbot s father was guilty There was never any doubt in my mind that he was guilty Well not much anyway I knew that eventually Talbot was going to have to see her father for what he was When she did she was going to have to make a choice between decency and family loyalty It was that conflict that I was looking for and I wanted to see how Talbot would react Lange plays that conflict very well In a sense this story is an expansion of the relationship of Adam Kelno and his son in QB VII
0709,Driving Miss Daisy,1989,Capsule review Good but disappointing story after its reputation of a cantankerous aging Southern woman and the chauffeur hired for her over her protests Good performances but the mechanics of the play that should make us care for these characters and convince us that two decades are really passing are strangely absent Rating low 2 Daisy Werthan is at war with the world and the world does not even notice it At 72 she is still desperately holding on to her dignity but she is having increasing problems interfacing with the world Her response is to lash out at anyone around and then go back to her lonely insular world As the film opens she is preparing to drive herself somewhere only to end up wrecking her car instead Her son decides it is time to hire someone to do her driving for her but she wants no part of the plan Her son hires Hoke Colburn for the job but Daisy refuses to give him anything to do at least at first DRIVING MISS DAISY covers in all too short a span of minutes the next two decades of so of the relationship of Daisy and Hoke We see both reacting to the prejudice around them against each s group racism against Hoke s race anti Semitism against Daisy s religion Hoke tries to be sympathetic Daisy does not try as hard Most of her impulses are selfish DRIVING MISS DAISY seems to be a sentimental favorite for Oscar nominations this year but in some ways it is a disappointment The film s screenplay is by Alfred Uhry based on his Broadway play and it is perhaps his writing that gives the film both its best aspects and its greatest flaws In the course of the film it is obvious why Daisy portrayed by Jessica Tandy is so unpleasant But the unpleasantness is so rarely relieved that understanding why she is the way she is is not enough It perhaps is realistic that Daisy is so rarely likable but it is dramatically unsatisfying Perhaps she is more than one dimensional but she is less than three Perhaps the story is really more Hoke s story but here too the writing is lacking Morgan Freeman does as much with a smaller supporting role in GLORY as he does with Hoke in this film Perhaps at the beginning he is a little more countrified and later he is a little more dignified but he too seems pretty much fixed in time Time is shown to pass very awkwardly in DRIVING MISS DAISY There is a change of props a graying in the makeup but we are told of rather than feel the passage of time By comparison in a film like SAME TIME NEXT YEAR also adapted from a Broadway play the passage of time is keenly felt and in that film the characters do change and are not so fixed in time This is not to say that the film does not have its tender moments but every time Daisy shows some consideration for Hoke they seem dramatically to be saying it is a major victory and frankly it just is not satisfying enough Freeman turns in as good a performance as the story allows him So does Tandy Aykroyd turns in his best performance ever as Boolie Daisy s son but none of these performances makes for a character one really wants to know not even Freeman s There just is not enough to turn this from a good film into a truly memorable one My rating is a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0710,Roger & Me,1989,After seeing ROGER ME tonight I was amazed that such a negative subject could be presented with such wit Roger is Roger Smith chairman of General Motors Me is Michael Moore a writer who is watching his hometown of Flint Michigan dissolve after GM lays off 30 000 workers The film is a documentary of sorts where the plot consists of Moore s comical attempts to see Roger Smith Much of the film revolves around his interviews with Flint residents and celebrities Moore is able to change your emotions between sadness and laughter at a moments notice Moore gives a quick history of Flint Michigan and then presents three years in which despair turns to hope and finally becomes abandon The despair is when GM lays off the workers You see the workers cheering as the last automobile is finished and a worker comments Why are they cheering They ve just lost their jobs Despair turns to hope when Flint attempts to appeal to tourism Immediately the viewer knows that this will fail The city builds a Hyatt Regency a shopping center and Autoworld an indoor theme park whose theme is the Automobile Moore compares the theme park to building ChemicalWorld in New Jersey or ExxonWorld in Alaska All go bankrupt within a year The hope quickly fades and people begin to leave Flint faster than ever Crime spins out of control When Nightline comes to town to broadcast live their broadcast truck is stolen Ex autoworkers are hired as prison guards and find themselves locking up their former co workers When the jail becomes too crowded a new one is built Prior to its opening though the gala Jailhouse Rock party is held where guests may spend a night in jail for 100 It is Moore s ability to expose irony in this way that gives the film an almost surrealist quality You see people celebrating the opening of the new jail but blind to fact that having to build a bigger jail is negative This picture is also a character study of sorts It certainly makes a character study of Roger Smith who appears in the film for less than 5 minutes The woman I attended the film with who rarely says a harsh word about anything commented Roger Smith is an evil man and I hope he burns in Hell It is also a character study of Flint Michigan Flint takes on an almost human presence on the screen that of a drowning man It is also the story of one of the few employed people in Flint the evictor He evicts those who do not pay their rent He has a job to do and must do it At least they have someone to talk to he comments while evicting his friends During the course of his interviews Moore seems to catch many people at their worst Pat Boone for instance describes how wonderful a company GM is for giving him two cars a year when he was their advertising representative Or when Moore asks Miss Michigan what she thinks of Flint s economic woes she replies I m for employment Or the semi famous Bob Eubanks joke for which he later made a public apology Whether intentional or not there is a very strong symbol in the film A woman who raises rabbits for food She says she raises them to about four months and then kills them While she holding a rabbit and caressing it softly she notes that it is to be her dinner She kills skins and guts it Is that so different from what General Motors has done to Flint Moore put several unusual conditions in his agreement with Warner Brothers The most obvious being the placard on one of the theatre seats that reads Reserved for Roger Smith Chairman of General Motors Another was that Warner would pay rent for all families evicted in the film He has also stated that he will create an endowment for independent film makers I found ROGER ME to be an intelligent and very entertaining film well worth seeing I plan to see it again
0711,Roger & Me,1989,You know when they send you flowers They send you flowers when you die An autoworker after being laid off in Flint Michigan Hold the flowers Michael Moore is alive and well Alive and well due to the success of his first film ROGER ME Roger Roger Smith the chairman of General Motors Me Moore is the story of a boy and his town and how the town goes from boom to bust It is also the story of the reaction the town has to going bust both by the people affected and the people responsible But above everything else it is the story of Michael Moore s attempt to bring Roger Smith to Flint Michigan to see what his decision to close eleven factories and lay off 35 000 people has done to the town in Smith s backyard Under normal circumstances this would not be the stuff that an entertaining movie would be based on In fact most people would probably prefer a root canal to seeing the suffering of families being evicted from their homes on Christmas Eve and the skinning of a rabbit But to fall into that trap would be to underestimate the acid wit of Michael Moore Returning to Flint after a very brief stint as editor of MOTHER JONES in California Moore discovers that Flint is going downhill at an alarming rate General Motors is starting to close some of its factories in order to move them to Mexico where the labour is cheaper Unfortunately the factories keep on closing until they are all gone Well almost all Moore takes pains to point out that there still is a single factory left but it is making lint rollers Not exactly automobiles but At least people s clothes will be lint free It is this ability to point out the absurdity that abounds when corporate America has gone wrong that make this film not only entertaining but enlightening The film s strongest point is its ability to cut back and forth between the affluent and the destitute One minute he will be showing street after street of vacant houses to the Beach Boy s Wouldn t it be Nice And in the next minute having Anita Bryant the Orange Juice Queen tell us that there is a lot that America has to be proud of though she is only able to think of Freedom and sunshine Not willing to rest Moore keeps on going at a frantic pace He tries to visit Smith s office and after being told that Smith is currently unavailable Moore shows us the desperation of some families being evicted by deputy Fred who Moore points out is actually a nice guy and is fortunate to have a job however unpleasant it might be Then without a breath he cuts to a group of ladies playing golf who feel that there really is not a problem in Flint except that there are a few too many lazy people They could find jobs if they wanted to Then it is back to more families being thrown out by deputy Fred this time with the General Motors chorus singing Christmas carols You d Better Watch Out in the background By the end Moore has not been able to talk with Smith much less convince him to visit Flint However this does not mean that Moore has given up In an unusual agreement with the distributors Warner Brothers and Famous Players have agreed to leave a seat empty at every screening This is just in case Smith ever decides that he wants to see the result of his actions in his own back yard Which of course is the whole point to the movie that this can happen in our own back yard and that if it does that we should not shun the problem Rather as Roger Me urges we should attack it Unfortunately if you count the slashing of VIA rail the closing of numerous fish plants in Atlantic Canada and the closing of several automobile factories in Southern Ontario one of which is ironically being moved to Flint we can see that Moore is right It can happen here and in fact it is
0712,Tremors,1990,To some people the term B movie translates as low quality film making If quality translates as high budgets big name actors and grand themes then that equation would seem to be true but as any progressive quality assurance person will tell you that s a somewhat arbitrary definition of quality A more useful definition is Conformance to specifications Or more simply Does it accomplish what it is trying to do Using such a definition it would seem likely that there are more high quality B movies than A movies since B movies rarely and almost never successfully have any higher ambition than to entertain which should be a relatively simple goal TREMORS begins in the back of beyond in Nevada a gritty little country store town with the name of Perfection with two handymen Earl and Val who do the dirty and dusty work for the region s few inhabitants They re a couple of tough fellas but they ve had enough they pack up their belongings in their beat up 4x4 and are heading out of town when STRANGE AND DEADLY OCCURRENCES block their way and lead them and the inhabitants of Perfection in a struggle for survival against THINGS I don t really need to say any more about the story than that you undoubtedly get the general idea Which leads to the next question Well is this movie any good The answer to this question relates directly to the discussion of quality above I cannot describe TREMORS in terms of any superlatives there is nothing original about this film there is nothing in it that stands out as exceptional and there is nothing particularly memorable about it But I don t dare say anything unkind about it either for if one accepts the premise that this is a B movie and isn t intended to do anything but give the viewer a good ride for an hour and a half it absolutely succeeds on those terms In fact it is so competent and deft that it could be used as a textbook case of HOW TO MAKE A GOOD B MOVIE One wonders if the credit CAROL ANNE HURD EXECUTIVE PRODUCER has something to do with it We have a plot that clicks along nicely with few false moves the story is developed intelligently and resolved equally intelligently The dialogue makes few false steps and the acting is competent throughout The characters drive the film TREMORS avoids the twin traps of either making them comic book heroes or condescending to them as rustic clods they re ordinary people who are reacting sensibly to a survival situation Val and Earl may be uneducated and unwashed shit kickers but they re decent people and not stupid or cowardly and even the local survivalist couple while the butt of a few jabs are doing the right things when the situation gets rough And TREMOR s biggest asset is that it hits EXACTLY the right tone It takes itself JUST SERIOUSLY ENOUGH to keep the viewer going without collapsing into outright comedy Okay this isn t a great film and I know those who want something a little more innovative and artistic will probably hate it But those who are less particular will find their time and money well spent and may even want to give a little restrained applause while they sit there with a smile on their faces in appreciation of this good natured horror flic Oh yes the caveats moderate foul language a little gore whether gratuitous or not is arguable
0713,Henry V,1989,The advantage of the longbow over its shorter predecessors is of course range It is entirely feasible to create a shower of falling arrows that your enemy must enter before he can even come near you provided you have brought enough arrows along This is probably the reason that the English at the Battle of Agincourt were able to kill what is quoted as ten thousand French while losing only 29 of their own numbers Bill Shakespeare s script for the current HENRY V tends really to downplay the technological advantage the English had at the battle implying the imbalance in casualty figures can be attributed instead to the fact that Old Hank really knew how to give one heck of a good pep talk Well song writers tend to glorify song writers and film makers like to make films about film makers so it isn t surprising that Shakespeare s stuff tends to glorify wordsmiths Even though the actual casualty numbers were probably closer to 200 and five thousand Shakespeare still seems to over rate Henry s speech making That technical issue aside how is HENRY V anyway I do not claim to be a judge of Shakespearean acting and presumably the main virtue of this film is Branagh s much vaunted interpretation of Henry I can tell you that in the early scenes he delivers his lines with very little expression at all I am sure this is intentional but after a supremely dramatic entrance he strikes the viewer as being a sort of a cold fish As time goes by he puts more emphasis in his words and by the love scenes at the end he seems not just human but positively likable One gets the impression that henry was a wild teenager who rises to his office as king while we watch Still Branagh seems only a good actor who has the audacity to cast himself in a great role He may become a Rupert Pupkin of Shakespearean actors This is a Shakespeare for the late Twentieth Century with far more dramatic visual images than in previous versions Notable particularly are Henry s entrance and a scene of Henry on a rearing steed at the breach back lighted by fire The battle scenes are beautifully filmed somewhat in the style of EXCALIBUR Ironically the narrator tells the audience to work hard to picture the scene while the audience have only to sit back and let it flow over them While they did not remove the line to tell the audience to work to visualize the scene some liberties were taken Flashback scenes were added to show Henry s past with Falstaff Presumably Branagh undertook to write these himself in a Shakespearean style There was a deletion to references to the English killing French prisoners which probably would not play as well on modern audiences as it did in Shakespeare s time This is a memorable film and probably one that will be playing on PBS in 2010 when most of the rest of this year s films are forgotten My rating is a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0714,My Left Foot,1989,Capsule review Upbeat but not saccharine tale of Christy Brown Paralyzed with cerebral palsy so that he has control only over one foot he becomes an artist and an author The film perhaps over emphasizes his romantic life over other aspects that could be more interesting but it is a superb performance Rating 2 Christy Brown was born with cerebral palsy to a poor Dublin family Paralyzed so that he has control only over one foot he used that foot to write and paint distinguishing himself in both until his death in 1981 This is his story from birth to his late thirties told as a series of flashbacks as he thinks about his life one afternoon This is not just his biography but also a portrait of living conditions for the poor in Dublin in the 1930s and 1940s We see not just his life but also his times His father was a heavy drinker and a bully Some of the early scenes of Brown as a child trapped in this household and in a body he cannot operate have a nightmarish quality most fictional horror films cannot approach We cower with a terrified Christy when his father goes on drunken rampages People call him an idiot to his face and he has no way to respond or prove them wrong We struggle with Christy the first time he tries to communicate scratching on the floor with a piece of chalk between his toes answering an arithmetic problem that his father had missed a few minutes before Like many people with communications disabilities he is assumed to be profoundly retarded when in fact he has a very quick mind This sort of film could easily have become sentimental inspirational muck In fact it has more of the feel of Daniel Keyes s FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON As Christy raises himself his world perspective changes At times he is not very likable and often he is manipulative Where the story falls short of FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON is that it lacks the drama of the fall or that book s awe at intellectual achievement And like the aborted stage version of FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON the peak of Christy Brown s achievement is that he gets the girl nothing more profound In spite of the film s apparent emphasis on the importance of Christy s love life it is one of the better portraits of the life of the handicapped on film Daniel Day Lewis is good as the adult Christy as has been noted by other reviewers I have seen little credit given however to what I consider even better performances by Ray McAnally as Christy s swaggering ruffian father and especially by Hugh O Conor as the young Christy At age 13 O Conor turns in the best performance in a well acted film The screenplay was written by Shane Cunningham and the director Jim Sheridan My rating is a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0715,Flashback,1990,Flashback stars Dennis Hopper and Kiefer Sutherland in a story which mirrors the current male bonding cop stories but gives the viewer just a little more to think about Hopper is Hewey Walker a stalwart rebel of the 1960 s who was put in jail for political crimes Sutherland is John Buckner an unshakeable FBI agent who is assigned to escort Walker to another site For the first part of the film these two characters work very well Hopper using style and body language to give the viewer a good picture of the loose and somewhat crazed Walker He constantly hazes and teases Buckner as he tries to get under his skin These scenes are enjoyable but are terribly reminiscent of another film called MIDNIGHT RUN As the story progresses Walker succeeds in breaking down Buckner s hard shell and in a quick sweep I ll leave the details out switches places with Buckner Walker now wears the conservative suit and tie and is clean shaven while Buckner is stuck with the old jeans and jacket It is part of Walker s great escape plan However before Walker can get away clean he and Buckner both get caught up in a corrupt county sheriff s plans and basically end up on his death list In fleeing from the sheriff the two characters learn to work together and each shares his secrets and learns of the other s In the end Walker finds himself catching up with the times and actually breaking the rules of the counter culture community by catering to the pursuit of money while Buckner discovers a latent love for his past involvement with the counter culture What makes this film work is the message which it develops throughout its run In Walker s own words The 90 s will make the 80 s look like the 50 s of the 60 s The difference between this movie and its similar counterparts MIDNIGHT RUN and TRADING PLACES amongst others is the background material and historical validity which come with it Like most of Hopper s work it requires the audience to think with their brain and not just with their eyes about what is being said Hopper himself is the key to making this picture better than its predecessors not only as an actor but as a creator as well On the down side while I found the movie and its messages entertaining I didn t find them particularly valuable versus PLATOON BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY BREAKING AWAY THE BIG EASY or other Hopper films RIDERS OF THE STORM and HOOSIERS This is definitely lighter Hopper fare and it s a fun film which is probably what it was intended to be in the first place The ending was just too pat and sweet for me You get the idea in the first 20 minutes that Hopper is really having fun playing Walker Not a top ten film by any means but worth the price of admission especially if you re a Hopper fan Of course it is loads better than the standard Hollywood garbage
0716,Hard to Kill,1990,REVIEW OF STEVEN SEGAL S NEW MOVIE _HARD TO KILL_ I had some serious problems with this whole movie It took so much suspension of disbelief that I could not really escape the fact that this is a repeat of all poor cop movies that I have seen before In fact the repeats were so poorly done that many of the lines that were supposed to have strong impact or loving tenderness made the audience laugh The fight scenes were good but the same as the last movie ABOVE THE LAW probably more stilted then the last and had really nothing more spectacular than the last movie There are actually fewer Aikido scenes and very similar moves identical as the previous and he is so wheedling and condescending to his opponents they probably don t deserve better that he shows no humility or fear at all Makes him out to be a superman with no chance on not getting out of the problem The story line is not original as none really are any more and has nothing new to say about either the characters or the art in which we are wanting to see The training sequences always one of my favorites were hackneyed and unoriginal with cliched or unbelievable sections throughout The dialog was slack unoriginal and unimaginative The violence level was up there with many people being broken and beaten throughout And that is only on his part there is further violence that gets him in this state of rage I guess Joe Bob Briggs would call this a several galloner or something Kelly Le Brock who has had several vivacious and sexy roles in the past is neither in this It seems as if she forgot how to act in the intervening years It felt like she was there simply because she is Steven Segal s real life wife She does nothing for the role being neither sexy or intelligent or better a combination of both Steven Segal is not very sexy or intelligent in his role either He is an aikido master he is good looking and moves very fine but has no range as an actor There is never any change in his expression to rage pain except physical or happiness He goes in gets the job done and doesn t care who loves or cares about him Very cold Now before people get to me about this coldness there are ways to make a movie with all this limited emotion and make it real but you must show us the psychological build up of it all none of this was clear No inner workings no glimpse of himself except once and it was good but stood out so much because of the quality of the rest of the movie
0717,Nightbreed,1990,The Phantom is going to back into this review of NIGHTBREED by first covering a little of Clive Barker s cinematic history Those phans who have no patience for the Phantom s history lesson can fast forward to the good parts a few paragraphs down But note well that the Phantom will be very very disappointed in you if you do And you don t want that now do you The Phantom believes he can best discuss NIGHTBREED in the context of Barker s other work including his two previous cinematic efforts HELLRAISER and its sequel HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II Although NIGHTBREED stands as a horror film in its own right any true fan of Barker s work must of necessity compare it to what else he has brought us over the past three years and see how it is both better and worse than its worthy predecessors That said a bit of history Ever since HELLRAISER s 1987 debut the Phantom has heard rumors that the reason it was so good so stylish and so scary had little to do with Clive Barker s skill as a director Rather though the story and characters sprang from Barker s fertile imagination the film itself was taken out of Barker s hands once he demonstrated a distinct lack of skill in bringing HELLRAISER in on time and on budget So the person who finished the film and made it one of the classic films of the genre was not Barker at all but instead was Tony Randel none other than the director of HELLRAISER s sequel HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II Throughout both films one can see Barker s characters hear his dialogue and relish his inventive story lines But it is Randel who is responsible for the look the pacing the editing and the camera work of the films in the HELLRAISER series it is he not Barker who is responsible for making those films what they are Now the Phantom must caution that this is only rumor he has never had it either confirmed or denied though he has heard if from more then one source And though it is circumstantial evidence at best he would direct doubting phans to notice the look of both films for films made by different directors they look startlingly alike The Phantom can t think of another pair of films directed by different people that so closely resemble each other though he can of course think of many pairs that look entirely different the two BEVERLY HILLS COP films for example That said we arrive at NIGHTBREED Barker s latest film and one which he both directed and adapted from his recent novel CABAL And in keeping with the Phantom s theories about the creative force behind Barker s two previous films NIGHTBREED looks and feels nothing like them That is a shame since the Phantom thinks that whatever their pluses and minuses both of the films in the HELLRAISER series are stylish and visually compelling well edited and directed and very very effective He would also like to say the same of NIGHTBREED but alas he cannot NIGHTBREED feels choppy and poorly constructed almost as if much more than its running time of about 100 minutes was filmed but then ultimately left on the cutting room floor It suffers to a great degree from DUNE itis an illness that affects nearly all films based on novels This means that NIGHTBREED will present problems for two kinds of moviegoers those who have read CABAL and those who haven t While the former will be disappointed in the way large sections of the story have been eliminated from or glossed over in the film at least they won t be as confused as the latter The Phantom suspects that Caryn James of the New York Times is a member of the latter group since in her review of NIGHTBREED she called the film a huge yawn of a movie To the Phantom this demonstrates that Ms James might perhaps be more comfortable reviewing films in other genres or other media altogether since although NIGHTBREED has more than a few weaknesses a huge yawn of a movie it most certainly is not Yet the Phantom can understand what Ms James s problem might have been without having read CABAL much of NIGHTBREED really doesn t make much sense People do and say things for no reason or for reasons that are never explained the psychiatrist Decker slips in and out of his Mask at random or convenient times and kills for reasons Barker keeps to himself and Midian itself comes across as little more than an underground Sheraton convention center for the dead even though in CABAL Barker presented it as the strange and frightening home of the last of the shapeshifters a species neither living nor dead but certainly more than just a bunch of monsters sitting around talking But those who have read CABAL may not enjoy NIGHTBREED much more than Ms James if only because knowing what to expect so diminishes the film s few surprises And without the wonderful interior monologues of characters like The Mask NIGHTBREED is reduced to relating in a perfectly straightforward and sequential manner CABAL s basic plot one that even the most ardent of Barker s fans would have to agree is pretty thin To his credit Barker admirably does refrain from embellishing NIGHTBREED with a constant stream of voice overs in an attempt to explain what s going on in this way at least NIGHTBREED escapes from the full effects of DUNE itis And just for the sake of completeness the Phantom will add that NIGHTBREED contains some truly awful dialogue But unfortunately that should not come as much of a surprise to any fan of the genre So the Phantom didn t like this one you ask Not so fast remember just because he has taken pains to explain a film s bad points doesn t mean that the Phantom didn t have a great time while he was watching it And truth be known once the Phantom realized that NIGHTBREED really wasn t in the same class as the films in the HELLRAISER series he enjoyed himself immensely As a horror film wholly apart from Barker s previous efforts NIGHTBREED is on the whole a resounding success and a heck of a lot of fun Please excuse the MPAA unrated cuss word in the last sentence Let s hit the film s high points First there s David Cronenberg s yes that David Cronenberg characterization of the psychiatrist Decker and his alter ego The Mask Cronenberg turns in a truly chilling performance one nearly good enough for a starring role in DEAD RINGERS II In fact Cronenberg s was one of the film s two good performances the other was that of the ex Hill Street Blues actor Charles Haid Renko who played sheriff Eigerman and he s in enough of the scenes to allow one to overlook the film s other less than award winning performances The special effects especially the creature effects are outstanding and there s also enough gore to satisfy all but the most hard core of Barker s fans Slash and trash fans should be just as happy as the rubber mask set since there are equal amounts of each In fact throughout NIGHTBREED there s almost always something to keep one amused and interested in the proceedings and it s only rarely that one becomes aware of the inherent silliness of the plot and some of the dialogue The film s sound effects and music are fairly good although the Phantom doesn t think that the score ranks up there with Danny Elfman s best work he seems to have done better by BATMAN and THE SIMPSONS than by Barker NIGHTBREED also seems to have been filmed in Dolby Surround a nice surprise or perhaps the standard Dolby stereo work was just above average it s sometimes difficult to tell in the sleazepit theaters the Phantom frequents As the Phantom has pointed out the editing and direction leave something to be desired and one must certainly overlook the plot holes if one is going to enjoy oneself But that s a given with almost any film in the genre and to his credit Barker has made sure that however silly things get NIGHTBREED remains internally consistent and that although logic may occasionally be challenged it is never overtly defied Assuming that an underground community of shapeshifting cannibals doesn t defy logic and for the life of him the Phantom cannot imagine why it should So all in all NIGHTBREED is a success and well worth seeing before it takes its leave of the silver screen and arrives on video in a few months Although not in the same league as Barker s HELLRAISER series NIGHTBREED is a quality horror film that never fails to entertain even when it does occasionally fail to make a whole lot of sense
0718,Nightbreed,1990,Well I saw NIGHTBREED just under twelve hours ago Finally a horror movie worth being called a horror movie Excellent special effects They must have spent most of the budget on the creature shop A wide variety of creatures all of them quality work Good acting good directing excellent sets are you getting the idea that I loved this movie I felt they could have spent a little more time developing Boone s character in the beginning of the movie If you hadn t read CABAL you might not understand why he was so willing to believe Decker I thought Cronenberg did a good job though not a great one He was believable as Decker but I don t know if I d like him in another movie A much better director than actor but a better actor than some I also felt they should have made more use of the Boone as a savior theme The artwork depicting the prophesy is shown all during the opening credits but is barely mentioned in movie Also the ending was a bit obscure if you hadn t read the book I could barely understand what Baphomet was saying in the end I really like the actor who played Narcisse Hugh something not Ross but the other one His character was much funnier than in the book and he played it very well even with most of his face missing I loved the shots with him wearing a cowboy hat and dark glasses Rachel was also very good Barker did a good job expanding her character so the audience had a way of understanding a little bit of the history of Midian Clive Barker IMHO is one of if not the best horror directors around He makes a visually stunning movie and characters I really care about The characters don t do exceptionally stupid things oh let s take our clothes off and go have sex in the woods even though three people have been chopped to pieces and the movie has its own internal logic which it follows faithfully the sun can kill me only when it suits the plot and so forth I think he could use a little improvement in directing slow scenes but hey this is only his second movie To sum up an EXCELLENT MOVIE I ll be seeing this many more times Any body else feel this way I d like to talk more about it with people who have seen it
0719,Stanley & Iris,1990,What is a good script Or mirror image what is a bad script Usually when you hear someone say that a film has a bad script what they really mean is that the film is derivative that the dialog is poor that there is no characterization that it is predictable that it fails to engage the viewers Well none of those things are true of STANLEY AND IRIS yet it has a bad script or at least a fatally flawed one and that s what makes it a fair film rather than a good film STANLEY AND IRIS deals with the relationship of two middle aged working class people in a small Eastern city certainly not a derivative situation The dialog is true to character sounds realistic and even has a bit of poetry to it The two principals are clearly defined engaging characters and some of the supporting roles aren t too badly drawn While the major thrust of the story follows lines that many other films have followed the path to the resolution is interesting and filled with nice twists And to some extent at least STANLEY AND IRIS does make us care about the lives of its major characters Where the script fails is in dramatic construction Writers Harriet Frank Jr and Irving Ravetch have failed to provide a clear relevant sequence of events each leading from one to the next that tells a story In STANLEY AND IRIS while succeeding scenes clearly have some dramatic connection to those that preceded causality seems to be lacking For example we understand why at one point Stanley breaks off the relationship And we see him begin it again But why The film shows us nothing that makes this change understandable Perhaps we are meant to fill in the blanks by understanding the destiny of the plot But the importance of these two people coming together is never great enough for the viewer to do that much of the work himself If this were the only lapse the film might not have seemed so choppy and arbitrary but the whole movie is constructed that way Which is a pity because STANLEY AND IRIS is not a bad film Director Martin Ritt stages each scene rather well As is his way he also provides a sense of authenticity to the setting As in SOUNDER and NORMA RAE Ritt makes us believe in the people and the life they lead by not allowing false heroics or false tragedies and by showing us generous slices of daily living that seem familiar comfortable and correct The photography is also good It comes from a school of cinematography that prizes the beauty of realism so there are no fancy camera moves the lighting is naturalistic and the shot selection is rather conservative suiting the subject matter But each shot is carefully considered and attractively lit making the New England city considerably more attractive than it probably is in reality The main attraction of STANLEY AND IRIS was always the casting of Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda in the title roles Unfortunately while each of them does good work in isolation and while there is no great clash between their styles they simply do not mesh on camera Their love is told to us but the performers fail to show it De Niro has never been especially good at expressing a nice comfortable form of love Grand destructive passion yes but pleasant romantic love no Fonda can but it takes two to do this tango That major failing aside the performances are quite good De Niro has made at least one acting breakthrough here Unlike his character in FALLING IN LOVE Stanley is a fairly normal person who is likable and not dull Fonda manages to submerge most of her glamour and charisma in a role that demands a certain plainness of appearance and manner Other than these two there are practically no important characters in the film Martha Plimpton repeats her sullen pregnant teenager role from PARENTHOOD with less material Actually I believe STANLEY AND IRIS was shot first so perhaps she repeated the role in PARENTHOOD with more material Swoozie Kurtz has a few angry moments as Fonda s sister but disappears totally from the latter half of the film Feodor Chaliapan memorable in MOONSTRUCK has some nice moments as De Niro s father STANLEY AND IRIS has received some major critical dumpings which I think weren t really justified It doesn t work but it s not a crime against cinema either It s a fairly entertaining 100 minutes or so with some good professional work from all involved Many critics seemed to have seized upon small points as a basis of their dislike of STANLEY AND IRIS such as stating that Jane Fonda s body was too shapely for the part or that Stanley s background made his problems seem unlikely But I think that these little flaws are no more than symptoms of the overall failure of the script to construct a logical dramatic story If the pieces had all fallen into place one by one as they do in a good dramatic film no one would have objected to the small stuff As it is STANLEY AND IRIS is a well intentioned film that can provide some pleasures with only slight disappointment based on the potentials of all the talents involved

0722,My Left Foot,1989,Just who is Daniel Day Lewis anyway He s gone off and lost himself in yet another superbly acted role MY LEFT FOOT is the story of Christy Brown a person so crippled by cerebral palsy that most people thought he was retarded until he was around ten It is the story of how Christy struggles to communicate with the rest of the world The movie is astonishingly good with strong performances by the entire cast but particularly Daniel Day Lewis as Christy Brenda Fricker as Mother and Hugh O Connel as young Christy The story is told in flashbacks and it s handled very well Christy who s written MY LEFT FOOT and has already received national acclaim as a artist is invited to a lengthy benefit at a manor in Britain Since he does not like to appear in public he spends most of the benefit in a side room in the company of a nurse The nurse reads his book so Christy s story unfolds as she reads The details about living in a poor neighborhood in Dublin abound in most of the movie The Browns have too many children live in too small a house and are well meaning but uneducated people Mother believes that Christy is intelligent and talks to him all the time even though he can t respond Father is convinced he s an idiot but loves him just the same His many brothers and sisters accept him as much as they can There s a wonderful scene early in the picture when Mother falls down the stairs after having brought Christy upstairs He hears her fall and hears her silence He throws himself off the bed scampers down the stairs crawls over his mother and makes an enormous racket by pounding on the door with his foot When the neighbors respond to the noise and take Christy s mother to the hospital they assume she d fallen with Christy in her arms they cannot conceive that he literally saved his mother s life As his family gradually learns that he is intelligent they build him a cart and take him outside But Christy never does fit in outside So as he gets older he becomes more reclusive The older Christy is shown struggling to communicate and to be accepted He has all the usual needs of a young man but almost no one believes it When he learns that the woman he s very interested in is about to marry he becomes furious The scene of his fury is painful to watch because how can you express fury if you can t yell or pound your fists or chew the scenery though Lewis comes close This scene is particularly hard to watch but it is extremely well constructed The movie has one minor failing it often ignores the hordes of little children who populated the house most of the time Mother seems to be able to devote an enormous amount of time to Christy despite the fact that he was one of about ten children Christy seems to be in the one children s bedroom by himself quite a lot Eventually his father and brothers build him his own room off the kitchen but it would have made more sense to show Christy trying to paint with all his brothers and sisters around The movie progresses slowly but I was never bored In fact I think it should have lasted about another ten minutes or so how s that for purient interest It was rated R but that was probably just for bad language Anyway I think this is a 9 on the Chuck scale The Critics Consensus a national consensus of 40 leading movie critics rates this movie as a 9 4 the highest average on the list ROGER AND ME rated a 9 3 and DRIVING MISS DAISY a 9 By contrast TANGO AND CASH SKI PATROL and LOOSE CANNONS each ranked under 3
0723,Enemies: A Love Story,1989,The Holocaust is over and Herman Broder survived Now he is haunted only by nightmares of the night the Nazis took his wife Tamara and children All three had been killed in the death camps he d been told Now Broder is married to Yadwiga the Polish servant whose family saved his life Off and on he teaches Yadwiga to be Jewish though she seems more earnest about it than he is He has an okay job as a ghost writer for a famous rabbi and he has a good looking mistress on the side That s Masha a fiery Jewish woman who also survived the death camps For now Broder is getting by but soon his mistress will be pregnant and wanting to be married and to make matters worse Broder s first wife survived after all and this will leave Broder with two wives more than he can handle Paul Mazursky s ENEMIES A LOVE STORY based on a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer is a surprisingly well realized comedy drama with four characters one husband and his three wives all believable and three dimensional And the fifth character is the post war Jewish community in New York very authentically recreated on the screen authentic enough that it brought back memories of when I was very young not long after this film is set Broder s three wives are very different types each with her own strengths Margaret Sophie Stein plays stolid sincere and homely Yadwiga still half living in the Poland in which she grew up She knows her husband has some hanky panky going on but ignores it while she can thinking that if she can make herself Jewish enough she can hold on to him The bewitching Lena Olin of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING plays Masha burning out her life as quickly as she can Then there is Anjelica Huston as Tamara at first bitterly bent on reclaiming her husband but eventually transforming herself into a healing force And at the center of these women is Herman himself played by Ron Silver confused and indecisive with a need to feel he is in control of things most of which are beyond him There is a lot of film here For a film with both comedy and drama there is surprisingly much of each The comedy does not feel at all forced and is all very human The drama is also very human and at times very painful Maurice Jarre understood the film very well and provided a score with light klezmer music to underscore the comedy and with sad clarinet music to underscore the more serious moments ENEMIES is one of the better films of 1989 a year that had more than its share of good films I rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale For those who worry about such things there is explicit sex and indistinct dialogue I didn t mind the former but lamented the latter
0724,Hunt for Red October The,1990,Tom Clancy created a new market for the techno thriller genre of story telling with his 1984 novel THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER This genre is intended to tell a crackling good story about the military and at the same time include a lot of executive summary explanations about what equipment is used how strategy is determined and anything else about defense that comes up in the course of the story There was enough technical detail though its accuracy has since been questioned that the book became the first fiction publication of the Naval Institute Press whose usual fare was dry reference material on subject matter such as tides The book quickly became that rarity today a book that was not just a best seller by its own admission but also in the public s perception When THE HUNT OF RED OCTOBER made it to paperback you saw a lot of people reading the paperback Personal note shortly after the paperback came out I read it on a boat with less than a hundred passengers and I saw at least three other copies being read Now that best seller has been filmed Part of the irony of the film coming out now is that while the source was greatly popular it was all about the Cold War defense chess game that the NATO countries play with the Soviet Union It is quite possible that the genre that the book fostered is itself going to be the victim of new friendlier relations with the Soviet Union as at least in the public perception the Cold War seems to be coming to an end I have yet to hear anyone say that the nuclear submarine fleet is being dismantled or that anyone has backed off of the edge of nuclear war defense routine so there may still be material for new techno thrillers that work as something other than restricted period pieces The reason that THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER could still be filmed is that the plot did not include anything the public would have known about at the time so the film could still take the stance that this whole story is true and the proof is that both the Americans and the Soviets deny that it ever happened However some of the edge is taken off the story because the book gets its real tension from the ever present possibility that the events told will lead to a nuclear strike on the United States Read as a contemporary novel in 1984 or shortly after that was a real possibility for what could take place in the story That Sword of Damocles tension is missing from the film because and I say this as only a minor spoiler there do not appear to have been any nuclear strikes on major American cities at any time in the early 1980s On November 13 1984 approximately four months before Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the Soviet Union the story begins the Soviets had a new super submarine the Red October which featured a nearly silent underwater jet propulsion system This nifty little gimcrack has but one conceivable use It is unstoppable as a first strike device that undetected could nuzzle up close to the American coastline and then start firing nuclear missiles And for the maiden voyage of the super sub they had chosen to command their top submarine commander Marko Ramius played by Sean Connery Their joy at this great Cold War victory was short lived however Ramius steals the Red October and heads it for parts unknown Now both sides desperately want to get their hands on the Red October and neither side knows for sure what Ramius intends to do with the submarine It is of course impossible to take all of the action of a novel such as THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and put it into a film of standard length It is even more true with this novel than it would be for most novels since the original was very heavy with military aircraft of many different sorts very few of which made it to the film adaptation They seem to have whittled down the novel with a very large knife One of the most lamentable deletions was Ramius s actual motivation for doing what he is doing In the book that made the character what he was and added a very tragic dimension to his character and at the same time said something worth saying about life in the Soviet Union Perhaps in an efforts to make all its negative statements about the Soviets applicable only to the pre Gorbachev years the film blunts its social statement that still might be applicable The bad guy of this film is a Soviet point of view that is seen as being strictly pre Gorbachev Another lamented deletion if only because I would have liked to see Industrial Light and Magic s visual rendering is that there is no nuclear meltdown on a Soviet submarine This scene was a descriptive centerpiece for the novel and it should have been a visual centerpiece of the film That brings us to the visual effects that were in the film They were sufficient to tell the story and occasionally very nice indeed but surprisingly shoddy in other places One in particular that did not work is showing a torpedo coming at the viewer The technique they used harkening back to effects of the 1960s is to superimpose a picture of the torpedo on the background and then just increase the size of the inset picture You see this technique in films such as ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS which had a budget a small fraction of that of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER In truth it is done better here but it still robs the scene of some of the three dimensional effect The film also had a problem with some obvious matte lines I suspect however the films needs to take some liberties with visual effects if for no other reason than that seeing actual submarine fights at the proper depth it might be difficult for the viewer to see very much or to tell what is going on The underwater visuals probably told the story more clearly than was realistic for them to tell it Also adding to the effect is a score by a master film composer whose work is all too rarely heard Basil Polidouris He has scored at least two films before on the them of American Soviet relations RED DAWN and AMERIKA though his masterpiece was his rich and varied score for CONAN THE BARBARIAN by far the best thing about that film In THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER his score seems to have been influenced by the music of the Russian Army Chorus and Band And while it may not have been a very original or creative choice it certainly was a proper one and the choral pieces do make for magnificent sections of music Finally some mention should be made of the casting Sean Connery of course was not the first choice for Ramius That choice was German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer whom Sean Connery defeated in NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN and whom he beat one more time in the casting of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER I suspect Brandauer could have done Ramius a little better since he does not have a Scottish accent And perhaps to the ears of the public a German accent sounds more Russian than a Scottish one does However if the public thinks that Edinburgh raised Connery does not sound sufficiently Russian the producers could counter that he really is not supposed to be Ramius is not Russian he is Lithuanian Actually accents brings up one of the film s major implausibilities It is hard to believe that any Biblical passage no matter how powerful could make an entire Soviet submarine crew speak English and not even realize they were doing it That s an inside joke for people who have seen the film Second lead went to Alec Baldwin as CIA analyst Jack Ryan a continuing character in Clancy s novels Baldwin who played the somewhat simpy ghost husband in BEETLEJUICE is actually a very good Ryan a family man with a fear of flying who also has just a bit of Sherlock Holmes in him He has a very winning combination of high competence and vulnerability Like Ramius he is also a renegade with very strong opinions One of the nice touches of the script and counter to the cliche is that while Ramius has actually read Ryan s books on military history he does not think very much of them THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER has a heavy sprinkling of familiar faces in other roles Scott Glenn is crisp as submarine captain Marcuso Sam Neill is a little too sugary as Ramius s second in command Then there is James Earl Jones Joss Ackland Richard Jordan in a role as a wily politician that is somewhat of a departure for him Peter Firth Tim Curry as the Red October s goggle eyed surgeon and Jeffrey Jones While this seems more a Readers Digest condensation of the Clancy novel much scaled down for the big screen it certainly is a good adventure yarn particularly welcome because it was not saved for a summertime release I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0725,Basket Case 2,1990,In his previous review of NIGHTBREED the Phantom s lead paragraph was only slightly less self referential than this one is but there he did it only because he admires style over substance in all things his own reviews included This review however does require the Phantom to discuss some of the background of BASKET CASE 2 for without it he doesn t know what some of his phans will make of it Certainly if one expects an ordinary slasher alien pops out from behind a headstone under a staircase and stabs kills rips the limbs off of a hapless teenager just after just before having sex horror film one will be sorely disappointed BASKET CASE 2 may be a lot of things but ordinary it is not And with that said please allow the Phantom to discuss a bit of the film s background so that we may all understand exactly what it is that he is reviewing In 1982 Frank Henenlotter directed BASKET CASE a film that in many ways anticipated Stuart Gordon s later REANIMATOR It was a film that was part horror and part comedy and was done with tongue firmly in cheek BASKET CASE told the story of Siamese twins Duane and Belial joined at the side and of what happens once they re separated Although Duane is of average height and build and looks relatively normal his brother Belial stands about 2 feet tall has arms growing out of the sides of his head and has very sharp pointed teeth Actually he doesn t really stand at all since he doesn t have feet in the commonly understood sense of the word So how does he get around Well Duane carries him in a large wicker basket which serves the dual purpose of getting Belial around the city and keeping him hidden from those who might not be as understanding as his brother Sounds a little out of the ordinary right Phans Frank Henenlotter has done some things that would make even Stuart Gordon look away in shame This is the same director who last year brought us BRAIN DAMAGE an equally bizarre and offbeat horror comedy about a man and the parasite who takes control of him forcing him to kill innocent people so that he the parasite can pop out and eat their brains The parasite looks a bit like a snake with hands and has among other things a marvelous singing voice Offbeat is clearly putting it mildly Duane is forcibly separated from his brother by his well meaning parents who want only for him to be able to live a normal life and who think that having an extra head with arms growing out of his side would at the very least lessen Duane s chances of getting a date for the prom But Belial doesn t want to be separated from his beloved brother and neither does Duane since both brothers always enjoyed a shall we say close relationship including the ability to communicate via a form of ESP But separated they are and in revenge Belial kills the doctors who performed the operation and escapes to New York City with brother Duane and his wicker basket The Phantom won t give away any more of the original film but suffice it to say that things get steadily stranger from there You didn t think that was possible did you BASKET CASE was notable for being shot on a shoestring budget the Phantom thinks it was transferred from 16mm but he s not sure and yet not being at all compromised by a lack of special effects funds It also became an overnight cult classic in the way that most films become cult classics by being very silly by looking somewhat amateurish and by being a lot of fun BASKET CASE 2 is obviously a sequel to the original The story picks up where the last one left off with Duane and Belial falling to their assumed deaths from the top floor of a Times Square hotel room Reviewer s note to his New York City phans this was before the days of the Marriott Marquis and other 50 story midtown monstrosities Just as well as no special effects department in the world could ever design a creature as ugly as the Marquis Do they die Well no spoilers here phans but no they don t Surprise Just remember horror personalities never die they just become Jason ized a process that freezes the characters for a period of one year or until the video release of the last episode whichever comes first In this case it just took a little longer So Duane and Belial are hospitalized and before long they find themselves in the home of Granny Ruth a good hearted soul whose mission in life is to give unique individuals the privacy and respect they deserve By the way the Phantom likes that particular euphemism a lot and intends to use it the next time one of his readers accuses him of holding freakish opinions No he ll retort they are not freakish They re unique Well Granny has more than just a good heart she also has an attic full of what look to be NIGHTBREED extras These unique individuals are certainly unique but it s a shame that BASKET CASE 2 was released so soon after NIGHTBREED since some of the makeup loses its effectiveness that way It s not that the makeup is inferior it s just that at the moment we horror fans are suffering from what the Phantom likes to call Jabba the Hut syndrome too much plot in service of the special effects department particularly the makeup department and not the other way around As expected things don t stay calm and quiet around Granny s house for long Soon a reporter from the local Enquirer clone BABY RAISED BY HUMMINGBIRDS reads one of the headlines on the publisher s wall comes snooping around hot on the trail of the fugitive brothers and eager to start raking in those book paperback movie of the week film and video residuals Aren t we all The Phantom won t go further with his plot synopsis since the film proceeds in fairly standard form from there So what makes BASKET CASE 2 a cut above the usual horror fare A few things but most notably the way Henenlotter handles the age old story of an individual feeling alone and freakish different from everyone else and so isolated from society This film like its predecessors BASKET CASE and BRAIN DAMAGE has a heart to it no matter how absurd things get at base there s a story that people can relate to and it s possible to identify with the characters Well at least Duane although there have been those Monday mornings when the Phantom thinks he knows pretty much how Belial feels as well He also thinks that it would be best if his phans would rent the original before seeing BASKET CASE 2 since he doesn t believe that they would really enjoy as much otherwise Unlike its predecessor BASKET CASE 2 is low budget but not shoestring budget and so the unsuspecting might not realize that deep down it s still a jokey continuation of the original although the Phantom greatly enjoyed the film he doesn t think that it could stand well on its own This is true of course of many sequels but the Phantom thinks that it is especially true of this one if you haven t seen the original BASKET CASE you might not get all the jokes and if you don t get all the jokes you won t enjoy yourself as much as you should But don t be fooled into thinking that BASKET CASE 2 makes no sense on its own it does and it can certainly be enjoyed apart from the original Although the film tends to slow down at points it is generally well paced and plotted and the makeup and special effects are used well The film s editing and direction are tight and crisp Henenlotter has complete control of this film from the very beginning and he has a real flair for making even the most outrageous of situations seem perfectly plausible One of the most outrageous situations in the film is that of Duane himself since he s played by the same actor who portrayed him in the original Yet because the sequel begins only moments after the original ends we re suddenly confronted with an actor who is obviously in his thirties and who looks nothing at all like he did when he starred in the original BASKET CASE eight years ago It s a tribute to Henenlotter that Duane s appearance is more difficult to accept than is Belial s The Phantom was also delighted to see that Frito Lay products especially Doritos and Jolt cola are the official snack foods of Duane Belial and other unique individuals There are also a lot of Televideo terminals about and at times the Phantom actually found himself cringing in his seat at the thought that someone would gasp use one No Lady Don t go into that office Don t touch that keyboard he found himself screaming at one point The Phantom chalks this up to his own traumatic experiences with Televideo equipment in his distant past the reactions of other viewers may of course be different But the Phantom won t hold the blatant product placement against Henenlotter and the film after all one must have some respect for a director who could convince several major corporations to willingly lend support for a movie like BASKET CASE 2 which even the Phantom must admit is rather out of the mainstream A long way from Jay Leno to Belial no Suddenly Crunch all you want we ll make more takes on a whole new meaning The sound and music are both above average and although the cinematography is fairly standard there is some interesting and clever camera work at times And surprise of surprises it ends well Imagine a real ending one that doesn t look like it was an afterthought or a suggestion by the studio What more could one ask for The Phantom heartily recommends BASKET CASE 2 as in fact he does all of Henenlotter s work and thinks that phans who get in on the joke will enjoy this film more than some of its recent competition NIGHTBREED included By the way for those phans who are now intrigued by Mr Henenlotter and are slavering to know more about him watch for his next film FRANKENHOOKER currently scheduled for spring or summer release Previews for this epic were shown before BASKET CASE 2 as they re both from Shapiro Glickenhaus having seen the preview and considered the title the Phantom thinks that Stuart Gordon is going to have to get cracking since it appears that Henenlotter has just upped the ante
0726,Mountains of the Moon,1990,The Nile River came like a miracle out of the desert the last place you would expect a great river to bring life to the great Egyptian civilization That civilization was a major world power often the major world power for 3500 years and it was totally dependent on the enigmatic Nile the only major river that flows south to north Even today the Nile means life or death to countries in its path Not surprisingly when Europeans came to Africa they were fascinated by this strange river and in particular where the waters originated But it was time when tracing the river to its origins meant an expedition on foot under nearly impossible conditions And the only reward would be to go down in the history books as being the one who answered the great question Where did the waters of the Nile come from When the question finally was answered it was only at very great cost and it was an answer that would remain shrouded in controversy for almost two decades MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON is an intelligent yet visually spectacular adventure film about the expedition to find the source of the Nile It is about Sir Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke two very different men who made that expedition and the controversy that came out of that expedition The film covers much of the same territory that the excellent BBC mini series The Search for the Nile covered in 1971 and wouldn t this be a good time for someone to rebroadcast that series It is the story of how Burton and Speke came to go on such a perilous expedition of the experiences on the trek and of the bitter controversy that arose from their different conclusions about the sources of the Nile Sir Richard Burton was perhaps the most colorful explorer and anthropologist of all times and the film hardly does justice to the man s history Burton had fluency in dozens of languages and was sufficiently good at the art of disguise that he could make himself appear to be a native through much of the world Disguised as an Afghani he was the first European to enter Mecca and Medina He had an unquenchable thirst to learn about other cultures first hand especially their sexual practices in which he both observed and participated and their erotic literature He was an eloquent writer and translator but because of his fixation on the sexual many of his writings and translations were considered unsuitable in British society His was the definitive translation of the Arabian Nights and it accurately has far more sex and violence than the expurgated versions generally available Burton was a giant man with giant vices On the other hand John Speke was a petty man with petty vices His greatest passion was for hunting and he looked upon Africa in large part as one big game park populated with animals he could shoot and populated with savages best avoided Where Burton had a thirst for knowledge about other cultures Speke had an attitude of inflexible superiority that more than once put his life in danger William Harrison s 1983 novel BURTON AND SPEKE recently re issued as MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON shows much more the personality conflict between these two men and only vaguely hints that they may have had a grudging respect and even an affection for each other Curiously this film written by Harrison together with director Bob Rafelson based on the novel and on the logs the two men kept of the expedition reverses that viewpoint It says the two were actually close friends and the post expedition conflict about the interpretation of their findings was due more to English society wishing to take the opinions of an Englishman Speke over those of Burton Burton was after all an Irishman a free thinker and a writer of what English society considered pornography Harrison seems to have changed his mind between writing the book and the screenplay or had it changed by Rafelson about what were Burton s and Speke s attitudes toward each other The irony of the conflict of course is that while reading the book and probably while seeing the film you want to believe Burton it was Speke s interpretation that this Lake Victoria was the actual source that was vindicated Speke s measurements were eventually found to be essentially accurate and his conclusions were correct The film s two main characters are powerfully played by Patrick Bergin as Burton and Iain Glen as Speke both relatively new to American audiences The film also has a good cast of supporting characters In a film with two such interesting main characters it would be quite easy for Fiona Lewis to go unnoticed as Burton s stay at home lover and later wife Isabel Not so however Shaw s Isabel is a major character fiercely loyal to an idealized image of her husband an image of which even the great Richard Burton fell short Shaw s expression when seeing Burton seems to convey an emotion combining joy and astonishment the same expression she used as Christy Brown s teacher in MY LEFT FOOT The original Isabel Burton was by all accounts a remarkable woman totally willing to turn a blind eye to her husband s philandering just to be married to Burton Eventually her unquestioning loyalty shamed her husband into monogamy On the night he died she burned a priceless collection of his unpublished notes and forty one unpublished manuscripts in a misguided effort to preserve her dead husband s reputation Somewhat understated in the film as well as all European accounts of the expeditions is the presence of Sidi Bombay at this point an inexperienced African hired by Burton and Speke as a guide and treated very poorly by Speke but who went on to become one of Africa s great explorers The film s account of the great expedition much abridged from the novel and logs remains harrowing and gives a feel for the courage it must have required to venture into Africa on foot in 1857 The most horrifying sequence for me all the more so since I had previously read the account in both Harrison s novel and in Burton s account of the expedition was the incident that resulted in Speke losing his hearing in one ear Nearly as disturbing is the account of why Burton had to be carried and of the primitive first aid I will withhold the details of these incidents for the benefit of readers who do not yet know the story All along the way there are contacts with the local tribes each with its own culture and many of whom were not happy to see strangers The stories of the three expeditions naturally had to be greatly abbreviated for the film in fact we are only told that the third expedition took place but what we do see is sufficient for good storytelling Harrison and Rafelson s screenplay while based on the novel and the expedition logs seem to have invented details not in either At one point in a speech Burton says that no white man can claim to have discovered a body of water well known to the local tribes Even for Burton with his enlightened views this would seem an anachronistic viewpoint In actual point of fact it is not the discovery of the body of water that was important so much as its association with the river that is the lifeblood of Egypt and Speke really was the first person to make the association that the two really were the same body of water He also gathered reasonable evidence for that point of view As much as we would like to credit both the local tribesmen and Burton over the priggish Anglo chauvinist Speke it really is Speke to whom the credit belongs As a side note Burton s views toward Africa were less enlightened than his attitudes toward Arab peoples As Robert Collins observes in his 1967 introduction to Burton s THE NILE BASIN Burton s insatiable appetite for travel soon brought him to Africa He observed Africa and the Africans at best with the assumptions of a Victorian Englishman at worst with the attitudes of an Arab slave trader Not surprisingly he judged African culture which he made no attempt to understand as hopelessly inferior to the Asian and European civilizations he knew so well African customs manners and morals repulsed him perhaps because they did not fit his preconceived notions of civilization Moreover he never sought to separate race and culture Thus African cultural inferiority became obvious proof of African racial inferiority This Afrophobia led Burton as well as other Englishmen to place Africans at the bottom of the evolutionary scale of national and racial development True Burton was sufficiently condescending to consider Africans human beings but humans of the lowest kind He argued that only through emigration or perhaps by the adoption of Islam could they hope for salvation Burton s bigoted ideas of African inferiority colored all of his writings about Africa and the more he saw and learned or rather mislearned the more vicious became his contempt for the continent One should not read Richard Burton without keeping in mind this deep seated prejudice It is perhaps a pity that MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON should be released withing days of another adventure film THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER Since I had read both novels it was MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON that I was more looking forward to My reasons were at least two fold First however realistically Tom Clancy writes and however well researched his facts were THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER is fiction and the Burton Speke expedition is authentic history It really happened Harrison had some latitude with the interpretation of events but most of what we are seeing is true The second and perhaps more important reason was that Clancy s heroes sit in large and relatively comfortable machines and play out their game True if they lose they die but if they win the only price they have paid is that they are exhausted Arguably most of the impressive feats are done by the machinery But to set off on foot across mid 19th Century Africa with no more defense than a few rifles requires a different character of courage Burton and Speke set out knowing that even if they found the source of the Nile by the time they returned Africa would have eaten a big piece of each of them Speke could not predict that he would have to mutilate horribly his own ear and leave himself deaf Burton could not predict the diseases he would be stricken with but that or something just as bad was nearly inevitable And Burton and Speke went anyway because a question had to be answered To that degree they were greater heroes than Tom Clancy s fictional imaginings And yet they were real people And to find not one but two different books by Burton describing his expeditions in his own words I needed to go no further than my public library Because I had greater expectations for MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON than for THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER I knew it was much more likely that I would be disappointed by Rafelson s film Surprisingly MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON came much closer to meeting my high expectations that THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER came to meeting lower ones Rafelson whose earlier films were very different low budget films FIVE EASY PIECES and STAY HUNGRY has made an intelligent adventure film to be savored for years to come I rate it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0727,Blue Steel,1990,Competent and earnest acting on the part of the ever reliable Jamie Lee Curtis and imaginative cinematography are not enough to wrest BLUE STEEL from the jaws of a bad script Curtis stars in this new thriller as a rookie New York cop who through no fault of her own sees more gunplay in her first 48 hours on the job than most police officers see in an entire career Ron Silver co stars as a psychotic commodity trader perhaps a tautology apparently obsessed with Jamie Lee I say apparently because one of the scripts major weaknesses is a lack of motivation or explanation for anything he does Once you think you understand this guy he has a scene where he hears voices in his head The script is also all over the map in terms of logic At several points I found myself wondering how in the world that happened or how they wound up together there and how did she know that The film also expects you to believe that wrapping a 44 Magnum in a towel will make it quiet enough for a person in the next room not to hear it go off In short the suspension of disbelief required exceeded my threshold There are some fine tense moments and I liked the director s use of short depth of field telephoto shots BLUE STEEL wants to be SEA OF LOVE meets FATAL ATTRACTION but lacks the style and intelligence of either Die hard Jamie Lee Curtis fans should wait to catch it on video Others need not apply
0729,Handmaids Tale The,1990,Capsule review THE HANDMAID S TALE preaches to the choir in a rather formulaic look at a dismal possible if unlikely future where women have no rights Robert Duvall s worst performance in memory highlights one of the less convincing arguments for feminism Rating low 0 Back in the 1960s there were a number of science fiction films about horrible repressive futures These films got their vision of the future by a fairly simple turn the crank formula pick a current hot concern imagine a society in which nobody or almost nobody has this concern Now what will society be like with nobody worried about this issue Pretty ugly right These films were all pretty much logical descendents of Orwell s novel 1984 but that did it back when it was still original Films along these lines include SOYLENT GREEN Z P G FAHRENHEIT 451 and THE LAST CHILD and I would also include SILENT RUNNING Eventually the public started finding these exaggerated dystopic futures too dreary so the ones without much action died out and the ones with more action became mindless films such as THE LAST CHASE and finally MAD MAX As a literary style it did not go away and the occasional dystopic film like BRAZIL was still made on slightly more abstract issues such as bureaucracy This year the dystopic science fiction film is represented by THE HANDMAID S TALE about a future brought about by apathy to feminist issues It has been said that repressive views towards women see them as madonnas or whores In this film each woman is forced into the roles of whore servant or madonna wearing uniforms of red white or blue respectively 99 of the women were left infertile after the plague If they can afford it these women become the madonnas if not they are servants Those who are fertile become the handmaids Their job is to be surrogate childbearers for the madonnas The process by which they come to bear children starts by sending them to indoctrination centers which use Orwellian mind control techniques but which seem to be curiously ineffective at winning hearts and minds From there they are farmed out to homes where first they are ritually read the Biblical story of infertile Rachel getting a child with the help of a handmaid After that they are impregnated in a curious ritual involved lying between the legs of one of the madonnas while her husband does the dirty deed The film opens with Kate played by Natasha Richardson her husband and her daughter trying to flee across the border Her husband is killed and she does not know what happened to her daughter After the first shock all this she takes with a calm regret This means that between Margaret Atwood s book and Harold Pinter s screenplay somebody did not know how humans behave The film follows Kate through her indoctrination into the society of handmaids and her assignment to the household of callous selfish evangelist Serena Joy played by Faye Dunaway and her flat cardboard husband the Commander This role is quite a departure for Robert Duvall who usually acts in his films The only film that Duvall was in but contributed less to was INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS To director Volker Schlondorff does the dubious honor of being the only director ever to wring an uninteresting performance from Duvall While the film was colorful with lots of costumes in many ways the production values were poor In a scene where the main character is holding yarn she has two strands when seen from the front and at least six seen an instant later from the back Also at one point a woman gives birth to a surprisingly clean six month old baby And speaking of such scenes for a film taking a stand against the exploitation of women this film has more than its share of half naked and scantily clad women and most of the nudity is gratuitous Director Schlondorff used to direct ABC After School Specials and his style does not seem to have gotten any more subtle I rate this film a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale Unless you embrace any film on a feminist theme I do not recommend THE HANDMAID S TALE
0730,Lord of the Flies,1990,I ve read the book I ve seen the film If you ve missed out on either and don t want to hear about them yet then don t charge into this I ve found many of the comments on the new remake of Golding s LORD OF THE FLIES quite relevant Personally I was thrilled to discover that someone had remade the film Rather film oriented myself I often read books while trying to imagine a cinemagraphic approach to them and already having seen the original black and white film version I felt all through reading the novel that it should by all means be remade I liked the original for the most part but the novel immediately suggests itself to color It s a lush colorful island and modern film could bring many of the aspects of the book to greater life than the original did The original also failed to show sufficiently the character of Simon and his visions and I don t think anyone who saw the first film could figure out what it was the boys mistook for a beast I for one went to the film with eager anticipation hoping the book would be rendered more skillfully and in some ways more faithfully than the first film had My first disappointment was when I was told this would be about modern American boys rather than British boys of the period but I reserved judgment I watched the film and saw that much of what I thought was right A modern film did bring the island into greater vividness Color WAS needed And I must admit that both Simon and the Beast were better explained than in the first film I must agree with those who hated the Americanization of the film I thought about it as I left the theatre What was it about the American academy cadets that was so inferior to the British upper class schoolboys One thing struck me immediately the language The vocabulary of the American boys is essentially different and that hurts the newer film For one thing the profanity I thought the profanity and everything about the American boys dialogue was plausible As American boys But as the characters of LORD OF THE FLIES it didn t ring true For one thing modern American children are too articulate The essence of LORD OF THE FLIES what made the boys degeneration possible in the novel was the inability the boys had to communicate their fears Things are breaking up Ralph said but he couldn t explain quite why Piggy as an American child was simply whiny rather than dry and overly intellectual But there s something about the American boys that casts a pall over the degeneration that happens to them For one thing it isn t complete In the novel the boys actually become savages and Golding calls the member s of Jack s tribe nothing else from the moment Simon is killed until the boys are rescued The point of view of modern American children is too sophisticated too jaded There is too little purity to corrupt The mores of civilization don t rule and haunt modern American boys the way they did British boys of 1960 And again the language The writers had to change the basic terms to accommodate an American audience It was a monster in the remake rather than a beast offered presents instead of gifts The terms chief and tribe were only used half jokingly near the end rather than with increasing seriousness throughout It makes sense Americans don t say things like gift for the beast or chief of the tribe certainly not kids But those terms help make the story work turn Jack s tribe into something actually savage and nightmarish The chant was lost in this film Kill the beast Cut his throat Spill his blood The build was lost In this film we watch the kids simply become more than normally cruel little bastards In the novel they become personifications of evil I could go on and on but I guess I wanted the filmmakers to be true to the book because the book worked They compromised it Making the adult Captain escape presumed dead and become the Beast was I suppose about as plausible as a dead parachutist caught puppetlike in the parachute lines but it misses the point There are no adults on the island of the novel so far as the boys know And the Beast should be a puppet the irony is brilliant The paint The boys aren t just putting on cute Indian paint they re hiding their consciences behind anonymous masks And why were Sam and Eric the twins such total assholes They represented the last bastions of civilized innocence in the novel Everything was there it was just approximated simplified condensed cheapened The people who put this together sadly underestimated the American audience s appreciation of Art for Art s sake rather than money s sake The book even thirty years old even British reads beautifully for any reader with the guts to accept the ugliness it recounts In fairness I repeat that modern film methods did some beautiful things but there s nothing it did well that it couldn t have done better playing truer to the novel Ralph could have been flawed could have begun to forget what the purpose of the fire was except for Piggy s prodding The conch could have played the essential civilizing part that it did in the novel could have been shattered to pieces by the boulder that killed Piggy The pig s head on a stick could have spoken to Simon confessed that evil is a part of mankind and cannot be exorcised Damn we have modern animation methods and the second movie blows this chance too This film could have been LORD OF THE FLIES Instead it was a rather skillful if overly commercial approximation of it By all means see it if you like But I can t help but hope that you re not satisfied with it If you are you ve missed much of what makes the novel great
0731,Phantom of the Opera The,,The day that Tony Richardson s made for television version of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was due to be shown my local newspaper did a feature on it quoting the writer Arthur Kopit as saying After having read the novel what struck me was that this story wasn t very good Still it captured the imagination of people Why What bothered me about the previous dramatic versions what I thought they essentially missed was that you never knew why the Phantom was in love with Christine I had very high hopes for this version There were four announced film adaptations in the wake of the success of the Broadway play One starred Richard Englund whose most famous role was the razor gloved Freddy Krueger one was simply a film version of the musical one was set in Nazi Germany Of the four versions the only one that sounded like a genuine new adaptation of the novel was the announced four hour television version Then I read Kopit s quote What Kopit is saying is that he has no respect for the material itself only for its ready made market He also thinks that the dramatic versions missed the point of why the story is popular I could easily believe his comment if it really was the novel that people remember but in fact the book has not been what people have liked For most of the years the story has been liked Gaston Leroux s novel has been hard to find Andrew Lloyd Webber tells an anecdote about how difficult it was to find a copy of the novel when he wanted to read it The dramatic adaptations that Kopit thinks missed the point of why the story is remembered are really what made the story popular And here they cannot have missed the point Actually I would contend that they have all missed what I like in the novel but not what has made the story popular The novel is about a man with a great intellect and a horribly deformed face All his life he was treated as a freak and just occasionally exploited for his genius Eventually he finds the opportunity to build for himself an empire in the darkness beneath the Paris Opera House There he can enjoy the music and can be seen only when he wants This is Gaston Leroux s Erik but he has never been done satisfactorily in a film or play I had hoped that in the three and a half hours or so of story there would be time to show Erik s history In fact this version did show Erik s history but it bore little relation to anything in the novel Kopit missed the point entirely by making his Phantom a petulant young man played by Charles Dance of THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN who is being shielded by a former manager of the opera house over played by Burt Lancaster Kopit s screenplay intends this Erik to be likable and steers clear of the question in the novel of whether Erik might be psychotic This Erik does not kill at least in the course of the film Oh his face may startle and early on this causes a death but that does not appear to be Erik s fault This Erik has lost the feel of the sinister and instead controls the fate of the opera house with practical jokes Even the cutting down of the chandelier is not a murder attempt but an act of angry vandalism intended to vent rage and for which the audience was intentionally given time to get out of the way Of course this Erik had less reason for rage than the one in the book The script claims that Erik s mother at least found his face flawlessly beautiful In the book Erik s mother gave him his first mask because she could not stand to look at his face There are a few nice touches to the script One of them is the handling of the issue of how to handle the unmasking Sort of independently of the quality of the rest of the production there is the question of how to shock audiences when they do see the Phantom s face The approach here was unusual and not badly done though it was perhaps dictated by the screenplay s efforts to keep Erik as a romantic Phantom Less endearing is Erik s unexpected forest beneath the ground It isn t like the metal forest of the novel but a real forest with live trees and unexplained sunlight It appears that Erik must have built himself a holodeck Charles Dance is a little whiny for my tastes as well as not being sufficiently sinister Lancaster as the former manager is overripe and Teri Polo as Christine Daee in the book Daae is unmemorable She and her lover Adam Storke as Phillipe Comte de Chagney are pretty people but boring actors Again they got the name wrong on the Comte The character s name was Raoul Phillipe is the name of Raoul s brother older by twenty years The whole mediocre revision of the story is directed by Tony Richardson who directed TOM JONES I am not a fan of that film but it certainly was better directed than this slow moving version If I had never heard of the story before I would have rated this a little higher but as it is I would give Richardson s version a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale Postscript Of the dramatic versions of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA I have seen I would list them best to worst as the Webber play which is surprisingly faithful to the book the Lon Chaney film 1925 the Claude Rains film 1943 the animated cable version 1987 lackluster but very faithful to the book the made for television Maximillian Schell version 1983 the Herbert Lom film 1962 the made for television Charles Dance film 1990 and then there is a very long gap down to Richard Englund s putrescent version 1989 I do not count films only inspired by the story such as PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE THE PHANTOM OF HOLLYWOOD and PHANTOM OF THE OPERETTA Post postscript For someone with a better command of French than my own the name of the novel as The Phantom of the Opera but in the novel he refers to himself less dramatically as The Opera Ghost Isn t that distinction purely on the part of the translator Don t both translate to the same words in French
0732,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,1990,This is a somewhat rambling review of the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES movie Be warned that though there are no particularly grievous spoilers in this article there may be enough to remove a little of the joy of seeing the movie from an unspoiled perspective The most important thing to learn from this article is that the movie is well worth seeing at least if you like the comic book Now that you know that maybe you want to hit n now Last night I was privileged to attend the world premiere of TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES hosted by MIT s Lecture Series Committee I was tempted upon getting out of the movie at about 2 45 AM to rush directly to my terminal and send a review off but luckily the call of my bed was too great so I went home to sleep instead I say luckily because this extra time has allowed me to give the movie the consideration it deserves Here then are some of my impressions of the movie I ve tried to keep spoilers to a minimum and to warn you when they are coming However I haven t felt the need to be too diligent in this regard since anyone familiar with the comic books won t find the plot too surprising Overall I was quite impressed with the movie I found it to be a reasonably faithful adaptation of the comic book In particular they left the characters largely intact Raphael s uncontrolled rage and loner tendencies Leonardo s leadership particularly his concern for the team as a team as well as individuals and Casey s sometimes warped quixotism are all apparent in the movie There are differences of course April is reworked into a gutsy and intelligent investigative reporter but I can t help but think the changes are for the better Then too I didn t get much of a sense of Micheangelo and Donatello as individuals In fact now that I think of it I d say their main function was as comic relief to offset the heavier interaction between the Raphael Leonardo and April Casey pairs For example with one questionable exception there is no indication of Donatello s considerable technical prowess Unfortunately one character doesn t come off very well at all namely Splinter The movie industry has made yet another attempt to portray inscrutable oriental wisdom and they ve failed yet again In fact I m tempted to say that Splinter comes across as a bit of a buffoon Part of this was due to technical failings For example the only parts of the movie I can remember cringing at were the flashback scenes describing Splinter s life with his Master and his discovery of the turtles The stop action animation if that s the term I want was ill suited to the ostensibly serious tone of Splinter s narrative In particular the scenes showing him learning the martial arts by mimicking his master from his cage were absurd All in all the movie would be improved if these scenes were replaced by straight narrative without the visual aides However a bigger part of the problem was the approach they took to the character Two symptoms of the problem come to mind 1 Splinter had a goatee and 2 he spoke with a stereotypical Japanese accent Given the inherent problems in making a believable character out of a giant talking rat who is also a martial arts master I think that including these particular cliches was a lamentable mistake Among other things this approach made his character far too rigid and inflexible But enough of that Let s move to a more positive note The turtle costumes were quite satisfactory even if the faces particularly the mouths did remind me a little too strongly of Kermit the Frog occasionally The costumes weren t so unwieldy as to interfere with the movement of the actors In fact the only thing I can remember being distracted by is that the shell on their stomachs seemed too flexible I distinctly saw it bend once or twice Nor were they so garish as to distract the eye from the movie In short if you can suspend your disbelief enough to accept the presence of the turtles in the comic books you shouldn t have any trouble accepting them in the movie I was quite impressed with the screenplay They managed to rearrange the plot without doing gratuitous damage to the the comic book In fact if anything I d say the movie is more tightly plotted than the comic book Also noteworthy is the fact that many scenes are lifted from the book with practically no change However there were major changes in the arrangements of the scenes If anyone is interested in knowing what some of them are drop me a line One thing that might bother purists is that it is apparent that the violence of the book has been toned down considerably probably in order to appeal to younger viewers For example Splinter s master does not kill his rival in love instead he and his lover flee to America where they are hunted down and killed by the rival himself Thus Shredder is the rival himself not the rival s younger brother Similarly Splinter does not send the Turtles to kill Shredder as he does in the book I suspect that both of these changes were made to avoid sticky questions about the morality of Splinter the Turtles and Splinter s master and to keep the overall tone of the movie light Similarly the fight scenes lacked the intensity of the book There was no blood dripping off sais in this movie Incidentally I ll let someone else comment on the authenticity of the fight scenes I m not qualified to judge Purists might also be concerned about the portrayal of the Turtles Yes there is one scene where one of the Turtles is riding a skateboard And yes they are obsessed with pizza However neither of these things is obnoxiously handled A more serious flaw is the attitude they take toward Splinter and the art of the ninja in general I can t speak for the TMNT cartoon or for the Adventures of the TMNT but I feel confident in stating that the Turtles I am familiar with would not wander off to order a pizza while Splinter was attempting to teach them I m also not entirely satisfied with their behavior during the fights They re too cocky too showy not grim enough I suspect this was also intended to keep the mood of the movie from getting too heavy However on the whole these are the same wise cracking adolescents stewed in the popular culture of the day that I know from the books I must admit that their voices were a little higher that I had expected but then again they are supposed to be 15 years old I m going to gloss over the difficulties involved in such analogies between the TMNT and human adolescents So in summary I was impressed by the movie The failings I ve noted occupy a relatively small amount of screen time and should do little to interfere with your enjoyment of the movie This is a faithful adaptation of TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES a well done movie and all in all a great way to spend a couple of hours Most importantly this is not a movie aimed only at 5 year olds If you enjoyed the comic book you should enjoy the movie
0733,Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,1986,The Phantom can t remember the last time he was forced to suffer so much for his chosen profession Not that HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER was bad on the contrary it was one of the best horror films or films of any kind he s seen in a while But HENRY s not your average horror film No HENRY wasn t made for the misfits and members of the raincoat set who share the Times Square auditoriums that the Phantom frequents It actually has artistic pretensions so much so that the Village Voice in a review typical of its contemplative restrained style called it the best movie of the year So instead of opening next to NINJA DOMINATRIX and a revival of MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY HENRY opened in New York at an art house in Soho To be perfectly frank the Phantom much prefers the company of the kindred spirits who flock to each of Michael Jason and Freddy s features At least then he isn t the only person in the auditorium who isn t dressed in black At least then he isn t surrounded by hoards of pretentious espresso sipping Canby wannabees And at least then he isn t forced to associate with people who ask Is that real butter and then decide not to get the popcorn when they find out it isn t But here the Phantom is getting caught up in his own private hell something with which his faithful phans should not concern themselves though supportive email and expressions of sympathy are always welcome Let us instead get to the point HENRY is a great film For a film that was supposed to be nothing more than a run of the mill slash and trash flick HENRY is surprisingly good The director John McNaughton had in mind more than just Blockbuster fodder and with HENRY he succeeds in presenting a complete artistic vision a view from inside of a sociopathic killer Ironically enough we have our own very much under appreciated board of censors the MPAA to thank in part for HENRY s artistic success For had they not deemed HENRY unviewable by the nation s teenagers it was originally given an X rating it might well have been released and promoted as nothing more than another in a long line of slice and dice epics And had that happened a lot of people would have missed out on a stunningly good film since most mainstream film goers studiously avoid the genre The plot is quite simple HENRY was inspired by the story of Henry Lee Lucas a mass murderer now on Death Row in Texas Henry confessed to murdering hundreds of people including his mother but later retracted his confession and claimed that he murdered his mother only The real life Henry also had a friend named Otis who he accused of participating in his crimes and Otis had a niece named Becky who the police believe was among Henry s victims McNaughton uses this story as a starting point for HENRY and though the title might lead one to believe that HENRY is another THIN BLUE LINE a message at the beginning of the film states that the story portrayed is purely fictional It could only be this way of course for otherwise McNaughton would have had to rely on the very unreliable testimony of a sociopath awaiting execution The film itself looks and feels as empty as Henry s soul and there is very little dialogue As a film HENRY exists as a tribute to cinematic technique and the film works only because McNaughton does not judge nor even pretend to understand Henry Phans should not go expecting pat answers armchair psychology or movie of the week morals Even the scene in which Henry relates the circumstances surrounding the murder of his mother does nothing to illuminate Henry s motives worse its outcome completely confounds our expectations To McNaughton s credit that one quiet scene visibly unsettled the audience more than did all of the film s graphic violence In many ways HENRY reminded the Phantom of BLOOD SIMPLE but it seemed closer still to STRANGER THAN PARADISE in that the film had a disjointed empty feeling that nonetheless was exactly right in tone HENRY is also reminiscent of SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE McNaughton uses many of the same techniques as did Steven Soderbergh though while Soderbergh wanted us to feel somewhat ambiguous about sex McNaughton wants us to feel somewhat ambiguous about mass murder Shockingly enough he succeeds Michael Rooker who has previously acted in EIGHT MEN OUT and SEA OF LOVE turns in a stellar performance as Henry If you catch yourself empathizing with HENRY or if you find yourself understanding and agreeing with some of the things he says Rooker s performance is the reason why The Phantom cannot think of a less sympathetic character by comparison it was easy to empathize with DeNiro in TAXI DRIVER Even Michael and Jason cartoon characters that they are are more human than Henry for at least they have in their many sequels expressed some human emotion But Henry is a true sociopath and so exists in a realm of existence beyond our comprehension Rooker turns in a performance that in a just world should win him an Oscar it s a shame that he won t even be nominated What more can the Phantom say In its review The Voice was not too far off Though the Phantom would hesitate to call HENRY the best film of the year it will almost certainly rank in his top 10 by December Unfortunately for his phans though HENRY is currently only in very limited release Worse the film is unrated better that than accept our national censor s stamp of disapproval and so it will never be shown in a good number of movie theaters across this great enlightened land of ours So phans will you ever be able to see it The Phantom s guess is that most of his phans will have to wait and see if it hits Blockbuster s catalog in the coming months truly a shame in the Phantom s opinion since he knows how much of a film s impact is lost on a small screen But even if you have to wait for its videotape debut make a special note to see HENRY a film as disturbing as it is excellent and as thought provoking as it is stylish In short HENRY is a film that no horror phan or serious phan of the cinema will want to miss
0734,Ivan Groznyj II,1958,It has come time to review another undiscovered classic of early film This one shows up on public television every once in a long while but has been completely forgotten by anyone who doesn t watch PBS The film is really two Soviet films by Serge Eisenstein IVAN THE TERRIBLE Part I and IVAN THE TERRIBLE Part II It is difficult to decide if this is really one film or two On one hand when Part I ends it has more loose ends than a golf ball with the skin peeled off About all that is tied up is the current sentence Talk about leaving room for a sequel Eisenstein doesn t just leave ROOM he leaves the whole house An historical note on Eisenstein he appears to be the only Jew revered by the Soviets since Karl Marx Apparently he hid his religion by not asking to leave As with most films about conflict the IVANs tell the story of the unending struggle between pretty people and ugly people with ugly people being the bad guys This struggle may be more recent than we tend to think In Dickens s time it was more a struggle of people with funny names such as Twist and Nickleby against people with ugly names such as Mr Scrooge or Miss Zits It is only with the more realistic Schwarzenegger and Stallone films of the 1980s that the good guys are ugly too and in Stallone s case they are making up for lost time IVAN THE TERRIBLE is the story of how after an ugly becomes Czar he tries to run Russia for the peasants all of whom are pretty From a distance Ivan looks ugly his hair is greasy and slicked down and he looks like he probably has fleas But it turns out Ivan may not be ugly after all it may be a plot by his aunt who has a face like a corn grinding stone It was probably she who put the Penzoil in his Vitalis The film opens with Ivan s coronation which is more long and expensive than it is interesting but then that is true of a lot of Russian films They were made that way to prove to the world that Communism works so well that they can afford to waste film But you know that Ivan is in big trouble because the place is just teeming with ugly people There are a few pretty people who are saying loyal sorts of things but there are far more uglies and they are not at all happy that Ivan is being crowned Be warned however that some of the pretty people may well turn out to be villains You will know this is happening when the camera starts showing them in unflattering close ups Following the coronation there is a reception and banquet that turns out to be the funniest meal on screen since Blake Edwards s THE PARTY except I guess it came before During the course of a one hour meal 2 Ivan s best friend announces he cannot support Ivan and exiles himself 3 there is a peasants revolt where they burn the outskirts of the city 5 Ivan fights with one peasant in hand to hand combat 7 the peasants return to their homes the Mongol ambassador arrives and demands tribute The second film has some definite stylistic differences from the first film During the course of making the two films Eisenstein became more anti West as time went along By the time he made the second film the anti foreigner sentiment is obvious He puts much more bright light at the bottom of the screen so the subtitles will be almost impossible to read At the same time this makes the plot more complex and harder to follow I wouldn t say this about Part I but IVAN THE TERRIBLE Part II ranks up there with the original PHANTOM OF THE OPERA the original HELL S ANGELS THE RETURN OF DRACULA and SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT as a film that suddenly goes from black and white to color in the middle for no obvious reason It is quite a shock Presumably the Soviet economy took an upturn during the shooting Unfortunately the blues on the colored stock have been lost to time but the reds are somewhere between vibrant and oppressive much like Ivan himself Part II has enough songs to rank almost as a musical and some odd dance numbers including one around a peasant dressed like the Statue of Liberty The two film together are fairly long but the plot is not difficult to follow because it moves so slowly Other than the banquet scene in any given fifteen minute stretch you can be reasonably sure that not much as happened In fact even in two films about Ivan we learn almost nothing about the man or anything he did The snail paced plot instead gives plenty of time for meaningful looks and poses It is as if every frame was intended to be a great if not very realistic painting In all I would say that IVAN THE TERRIBLE is two classic films you may want to see some time Mediocre classics don t get ratings on the 4 to 4 scale
0735,Pretty Woman,1990,Overview Take one very rich man Add one smart cookie who has not had good breaks and is working the streets Mix well Add one very sappy ending Serve For a formula movie it was entertaining Not recommended for children The acting was above par Gere downplayed Roberts overplayed and although the plot left a lot to be desired anyone could have figured it out from the first few frames it proved to be a fun movie Some of the characterizations and motivations that surrounded Gere and Roberts were poorly drawn sketches that lacked any real substance Others were well defined and were played by actors clearly able to understate the roles The overall lack of emotion throughout the film may make it seen disjointed at times but also provides an excellent counterbalence to those times when the emotion is show Those emotions sometimes a delicate as the changes in Roberts face as she watches her first opera have far more impact than they would have had this picture been made with a constant flow of emotional highs and lows Although the plotting is somewhat predictable almost everyone can leave it with a smile maybe shaking their head no since it is so predictable but smiling A feel good movie that doesn t require a large amount of thought but does provide entertainment
0736,Pretty Woman,1990,Richard Gere plays Edward Lewis a powerful aggressive and very rich business man who buys up companies and spits out the pieces for profit With his limousine jammed in a parking lot he grabs his lawyers Lotus Esprit After the standard Where s first and How to use a clutch he ends up lost on Hollywood Boulevard looking for driving lessons and directions to his ritzy hotel in Beverly Hills Enter Vivian Ward Julia Roberts a hooker who needs rent money For twenty bucks she not only gives him directions to his hotel but also drives him there after he gives up handling the Esprit in exasperation After arriving at the hotel Edward almost leaves her outside waiting for a bus back to Hollywood Boulevard but finally decides to invite her up to his room There are some cute scenes where they enter the hotel accompanied by the expected dropped jaws tongues on floor etc etc After reaching Edwards room Edward is a little at a loss as to where to start the evening but we find out that Edward is very serious about what he does he has no current romantic interests he doesn t drink doesn t smoke doesn t do drugs and finds watching Vivian watch I Love Lucy to be a turn on Later we find that Edward is in the process of buying out a large corporation and that the owner of the corporation wants to chat with Edward about his plans for the company On his lawyer s advice Edward is to make the evening a social event rather than a business meeting so he needs a date After some tough negotiating in the tub Vivian agrees to be at Edwards beck and call for the remainder of the week for the paltry sum of three thousand dollars Romance blossoms with Vivian falling in love with Edward and Edward in his own way falling in love with Vivian There are some funny scenes including a scene in a restaurant with the ages old dilemma of which fork to use pointers on how not to deal with escargot and scenes of Vivian trying to shop on Rodeo Drive while not dressed appropriately After being asked to leave a swanky clothes shop Vivian returns to the hotel only to be greeted by the manager Hector Elizondo who suggests that since Mr Lewis is such an important person to the hotel they will permit her to stay but as soon as Mr Lewis goes home to New York they d rather not see her at the hotel again One scene that had me in stitches occurs when Edward finds out that the one shop on Rodeo Drive threw Vivian out and he takes her to another dress shop where they spend an obscene amount of money for clothes and some general sucking up The manager of this store reminded me of Wesson oil The end of the week rolls around and Edward is talking to Vivian about how he d like to see here next time he s in L A He offers to set her up with an apartment car money and everything else she needs or wants Vivian passes on the deal and tells Edward about how she always dreamed of the knight in shining armor riding up to her and rescuing her from the tower but the knight never said I got you a condo to stay in Edward and Vivian part company and Vivian prepares to move to San Francisco while Edward is readying for departure back to New York Somewhere on the ride to the airport Edward realizes that Vivian was the best thing that ever happened to him and takes the white limo to her apartment to rescue her Rating As a technical marvel or as a brilliantly written screenplay the story never reaches greatness A flimsy plot and some oddly placed asides by Vivian left me wondering if there were some important chunks of film still on the cutting room floor So it rates 2 stars average on the 1 to 4 star scale Enjoyability Disregarding the above the film is great I enjoyed it very much with Robert s performance being at the proper times funny sassy sad and mushy Richard Gere plays the businessman just like it should be done suave cool and debonair Edward s lawyer has just the right amount of sleaze and ruthlessness about him The other actors and actresses in the supporting roles were also appropriately funny and lent a light touch My wife loved it I liked it I ll buy the video tape when it comes out and so it rates a high 3 stars on the 1 to 4 scale
0737,Dersu Uzala,1974,DERSU UZALA 1975 Japan Russia a film by Akira Kurosawa It seems like I spend hours every week rummaging around videos stores and reading this newsgroup hoping to find that one movie that might change my life a little Or at least touch my heart some Alas as the years roll by movies like this seem harder to find DERSU UZALA is the third film I ve seen from the legendary director Akira Kurosawa who as you recall was honored last month by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The other two films of his I ve seen THE SEVEN SAMURAI and THE HIDDEN FORTRESS are his best known works along with RAN which I ve not seen yet But DERSU UZALA is my favorite so far George Lucas is said to have borrowed elements from THE SEVEN SAMURAI and THE HIDDEN FORTRESS for his Star Wars movies now I think maybe he derived the character Yoda from Dersu Uzala The story is of a Russian explorer surveyor in 1903 who while on a mapping expedition of northeastern Siberia meets and becomes excellent friends with Dersu Uzala a gnome of a man wise in the ways of the forest Dersu becomes the Russian s guide and they quickly come to respect and love him respect especially for his knowledge of nature on the taiga which saves them many times from certain death This living in harmony with nature is the ecological message in the film The characters seems very real and down to earth The action is slow and deliberate Nothing is wasted The Russians aren t the cardboard cut outs you d find in a typical Hollywood movie These people consistently Do the Right Thing The friendship that develops between the two major characters the Russian captain and Dersu was the best portrayal of friendship that I can remember in a movie Two friends saying goodbye knowing they may never see each other again is to me the saddest thing a movie can can have in it This movie has a couple of poignant goodbye scenes Which always makes me think of all the friends I ve had in my life which I will never see again But I digress As with the other Kurosawa films I have seen the cinematography was fabulous beautiful and atmospheric Sadly the video I viewed was not letter boxed and there were many scenes that just cried for it lots of times there was very noticeable panning and scanning I wish I could seen it on the big screen The film is in Russian with subtitles but you d swear that you could understand without Good luck in finding it at you local video store though in any format A perfect way to celebrate glasnost Earth Day and Akira Kurosawa All at once
0738,First Power The,1990,THE FIRST POWER is what Hollywood insiders call a high concept film For those phans who aren t familiar with the term high concept films are films that can be pitched to agents and studio executives in one sentence That s important since most of the people in the film industry have just slightly less patience than they have talent a two or three paragraph summary would have most nodding off before you could say cut to the chase But just because you can summarize a film s plot in one sentence doesn t make it a high concept film for otherwise nearly every film made since the late 50s could be considered high concept How best can the Phantom explain Let us consider by way of example THE OMEN and its two sequels None of these films are high concept the original most certainly isn t even though its plot is far from complicated And its sequels while easily described but alas less easily watched are just more of the same This summer s DIE HARD 2 isn t really high concept either but it comes close OK OK so this time Willis is in an airport get it But how about our imaginary third sequel DIE HARD 3 NOT OF THIS EARTH No the title doesn t refer to Willis salary I ll pitch it to you phans and if one of you sells it to Fox remember the Phantom wants his money above the line Here s the high concept pitch OK OK so it s like DIE HARD meets ALIENS right Willis is stuck in Moonbase Alpha and meanwhile this thing flies out and attaches itself to his ex wife s face Now that s high concept The giveaway any time you use the word meets in a description you re pitching with the best of them This brings us in a rather more roundabout way than usual to the subject of this week s review THE FIRST POWER a film that is nothing if not high concept Here s the pitch OK OK so imagine THE OMEN but with those Brat Pack kids like Damien meets YOUNG GUNS right And the killer s like Freddy meets SHOCKER so we can throw in a lot of dream sequences And we ll do the LETHAL WEAPON thing make it funny Did I leave anything out And true to its pitch THE FIRST POWER is the epitome of high concept films The Phantom went into THE FIRST POWER expecting an updated version of THE OMEN one of his all time favorite horror films And to be fair THE FIRST POWER is exactly that though since it s a 90s horror film it can t help but be influenced by the legacy of the 80s including Jason and Michael but most especially Freddy In fact in many ways THE FIRST POWER is a better ELM STREET sequel than was DREAM CHILD Problems abound though For the Phantom one of the biggest problems was the miscasting of Lou Diamond Phillips as Logan a cynical LA cop who heads the investigation into a series of bizarre occult killings Bizarre occult killings The Phantom is going to have to stop writing his reviews during Eyewitness News Tracy Griffith as Tess Seaton the psychic who helps Logan find the killer doesn t help matters Both roles call for much older actors and though Lou and Tracy do their best they really can t pull it off Of the two Lou Diamond Phillips does a better job but that s perhaps because he has more experience than does Griffith The film s plot is fairly simple although its exposition is somewhat confused Tess sees where the killer Patrick Channing played to the hilt by Jeff Kober is going to strike next Though she is curiously mute on the point of who is he going to strike next she tells Logan where Channing is going to be but only on the condition that he promise that there will be no death penalty Why she believes that a cop could possibly honor such a promise is one of the least puzzling aspects of the film though it is sadly indicative of the feeble plot devices that abound throughout In any case suffice it to say that Logan would have been wise to plead Channing s case before the Supreme Court since once he is executed he gets much more screen time than he did when he was just a garden variety occult inspired serial killer Indeed it turns out that all those pentagrams that Channing had been carving into his victims served a purpose Channing made a deal with the Devil who in return has granted him what the film refers to as the first power At a very late stage in the film the audience gets to find out what all the other powers are there are three though by the time we re told it s rather hard to care the powers seem to exist solely to explain the film s title which would better have been left as TRANSIT the title by which it was known throughout preproduction At least TRANSIT is original and as a title it makes as much sense as does anything else about the film so perhaps then audiences would be more prepared for the barrage of plot holes awaiting them after the last preview is over As to the film s title according to a slightly deranged nun the first power is the power of resurrection The second and third powers are related to this though as the Phantom scored poorly on the bogus Catholic theology quiz in the theater lobby he is unable to explain precisely what those other powers might be He himself had sadly lost his own first power the power of concentration by the time the film had gotten around to explaining all of this to the audience In any case once Channing has been dispatched he returns in a number of ways and in several different guises since he has the power to take control of the recently dead but oh how the Phantom wished he had the power to take control of the plot Sadly Channing seems to have little motive for coming back or not though he pops in and out of the rest of the film and of course fights Logan to the death in the rather less than epic struggle at the film s end it s not clear why Surely if he wanted to kill Logan or Tess he could just appear push them into a bad career move and leave But by the middle of the film there are really only three main characters so unfortunately Channing does not have the luxury of Freddy Michael or Jason the screenplay doesn t allow for a similar metronome like killing every 10 minutes Still things do get interesting when Channing makes an appearance and the audience never fails to perk up if only because they know that an appearance by Channing means that they ll have a badly need though all too brief respite from Tracy Griffith s acting Tracy s very young face is capable of nearly three different expressions and we re treated to all of them in various usually inappropriate combinations We re also treated to dozens of scenes filled with and focused on her chest though she never goes topless But if there s a tight tee shirt around she ll wear it if she has to stand still she ll be sure to throw her shoulders back if she has to move she ll make every attempt to run toward the camera and if she has to lie on the ground you can bet she ll be spread eagled To be fair she only lies on the ground in one scene but for that scene she removes her bra just to keep things interesting This is of course nothing more than a classic case of naked Ripley syndrome from ALIEN I ve just escaped the monsters so I better strip off all my clothes and though The Phantom appreciates any bit of sexploitation thrown his way even he felt that someone here was going overboard Tracy would be well advised to consult with Melanie or Don before making her next film since if this trend continues she ll have her name above the credits for BLUE LAGOON II THE NEXT GENERATION before she knows what hit her Think Tracy do you really want to be our generation s Phoebe Cates As for Lou Diamond Phillips he does his best but he really looks less than comfortable here He gets kicked around an awful lot in this film in fact the fight scenes are fabulously unrealistic most reminded the Phantom of Dolph and Sly going at it in ROCKY IV and he always appears to be dreading the next scene Will it be Channing this time Will he be thrown off a roof Down a sewer Will the stunt nun finally get him Logan s life is not an easy one and the Phantom was impressed with how well Phillips held up even after taking all those kicks to the head Of course the Phantom could sympathize a little since after THE FIRST POWER he too felt like he had taken a few too many kicks to the head by the time every one ends up in the sewer no doubt tripping over screenplays for THE SECOND POWER he needed a score card to keep track of who killed whom and of those who was dead who had been resurrected and who was currently possessed But the Phantom doesn t want to paint an entirely bleak picture Although it doesn t make sense for even 10 minutes THE FIRST POWER was still entertaining especially if you could forgive it all of its self contradictions and other stupidities Although there are enough dream sequences to make even Freddy roll his eyes they re still fun to watch and they re even occasionally scary On the whole the cinematography is above average the film doesn t have that flat mass produced look that so many horror films have and Jeff Kober does a great job as Channing This is the director Robert Resnikoff s first film and he does a fairly good job given the absurdity of a screenplay he had to work with Resnikoff has a good feel for horror and the Phantom hopes that he ll be back soon with another film though he believes that next time he and his crew should take a lunch together and decide just exactly what kind of film they want to make before they start shooting A little bit of everything that was successful over the past 5 years just doesn t cut it So the Phantom is undecided should he recommend that his phans see THE FIRST POWER now or wait until it hits Blockbusters For all its problems THE FIRST POWER is still fun to watch and it s rarely boring But is it worth 7 50 Let the Phantom put it this way if you liked SHOCKER you ll like THE FIRST POWER If you were upset that SHOCKER turned out to be so utterly brainless it might be best to wait for the 2 two night special since THE FIRST POWER is unfortunately very nearly a homage to Wes Craven s botched masterpiece Perhaps the Phantom will organize a half film festival for all the films he s seen recently that start out so well but then take a bad turn about half way through and finally end very badly indeed Admission will be half price of course and all the films will start every half hour so his phans can get up and walk out when a film s gone half way to hell if a film s gone all to hell you know you ve stayed too long Not a half bad idea if the Phantom does say so himself
0739,Nuns on the Run,1990,STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK shifted the market for adventure films Their slam bang pacing spoiled audiences who previously were happy with the pacing of adventures such as SHE and THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING Monty Python s various films and television show similarly shifted the comedy audience By pre Python standards NUNS ON THE RUN would be a frenetic comedy with some interesting characters and a few good laughs It has been getting some bad press as being not funny enough and lacking in the punch that a film such as A FISH CALLED WANDA had Well it really does not have the steady laughs of A FISH CALLED WANDA but it is every bit as funny as the classic Alec Guinness Ealing comedies And if it is less substantial than classic Guinness comedy it is certainly more substantial than most of the modern comedies being made That means that it is roughly eight times as good as empty comedies such as THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN or BLIND DATE In NUNS ON THE RUN Brian Hope and Charlie McManus are two aging hoods who want to get out of crime Their boss cannot afford to have them possibly double cross the organization so when the boss finds out they want to leave they know their days are numbered Their only chance is now to double cross the organization and steal enough money to escape to Brazil When their gang is going to rob a local triad gang Hope and McManus see their chance to make off with the boodle Note of explanation Someone can correct me if I am wrong but I believe the Triads are the same secret organization sometimes known as the Tongs The film makes fun of their love of cutlery The real Tongs are as professional and deadly as any of their European counterparts Things do not go well for the two and they end up with both their own gang and the Triads chasing them Their only escape is to disguise themselves as nuns and hide in a convent But Hope is bewildered by the Catholic religion he is now expected to know McManus is Catholic and tries to rescue him but his explanations are little help In the discussion of religion the comedy is at its richest Hope s very life may depend on his understanding McManus s muddled explanation of the Holy Trinity and the basic doctrines of Catholicism For the most part this comedy could have been done in the 1950s It pokes a little fun at Catholicism but never to the point that it is really disrespectful The film s only scene that would have been out of place in the 1950s is a delightfully vulgar shower room scene In general the film works like a well oiled machine with many diverse plot elements coming together in unexpected combinations Eric Idle of Monty Python fame stars as Brian Hope Idle s age is starting to show on him and he looks surprisingly middle aged here but that helps to give Hope character For once his antics are outshone by a non Pythonite Robbie Coltrane who played Falstaff in HENRY V and Bob Hoskins s mystery loving friend in MONA LISA The film was written and directed by Jonathan Lynn who in this country is best known for writing and directing the television shows Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister While lacking those series sophistication NUNS ON THE RUN is still an intelligent whimsical comedy I give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0740,Gods Must Be Crazy II The,1989,Capsule review Pleasant is the word for this lightweight African adventure starring N xau again as the benevolent if not always well understood Xixo the Kalihari Bushman Again slapstick and political farce mix in this cultural misunderstanding comedy Rating 2 When THE BEAR was released I said that it was one film that I would not mind see being turned into a series because the character is interesting enough that I would not mind every year or so looking in to see what he was up to Now that I have seen two The Gods Must be Crazy films I think I would enjoy seeing as many of them as Jamie Uys wants to make I thought the 1981 THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY depended a little too much on political farce and on a brand of comedy that goes back to the silent film days But then perhaps the film industry in Botswana is as young today as the American film industry was when those gags were popular here What really was excellent about the first film was its view of modern society through the eyes of a Kalihari Bushman Xixo played by N xau In the newer film Xixo is back once again played by N xau who is by now running the risk of being typecast as a Kalihari Bushman and who may never get to play the classic roles such as the one uncorrupt cop in a big city police force or the odd new partner of two policeman chasing down a killer The new plot has nine people running around the Kalihari in small groups that invariably got split up and united in various combinations You have one adult Bushman two Bushman children two soldiers fighting two poachers fleeing one woman lawyer one lost game warden and a micro plane high up in a tree The chaos starts when Xixo s two children find a poachers truck and climb on only to have it start up so that they cannot get off Xixo reads the tracks in the sand understands what happened and sets off to find his children Meanwhile Ann Taylor a New York Lawyer played by Lena Farugia goes up for a half hour plane ride with one game warden and finds herself stranded with another warden and an ultra light airplane that is out of fuel Also on the loose are two enemy mercenaries one African one Cuban As with the previous film there is humorous animal footage though this time obvious mock ups of animals are often used and in one scene there appears to be two men in a rhinoceros suit There is also a bit too much slapstick and fast motion photography for intended humorous effect There is alas less of the Bushman s view of our culture but the story is affectionately told and charming if not always convincing THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY II is a likable if lightweight film I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0741,Gods Must Be Crazy II The,1989,CAPSULE Not really a sequel but another film using the same clever basis as its predecessor A Bushman s children are carried away in a truck which they have never seen before He follows the tracks hoping to find them Along his way he encounters a biologist a lost lawyer poachers and soldiers A very funny film with a mild philosophical lesson Suitable for everyone Following the rule that a sequel must stand on its own Part Two can be seen by anyone whether they saw the original or not The producers clearly knew they had a winning formula and so mercifully not one thing has changed about how the story is told The production values are much higher this time which is a plus The humor acting and scenery are virtually identical to the first film That is there is a droll narrator some slapstick a man and a woman lots and lots of funny one liners and interesting and funny animals with one creature I cannot identify being entitled to an Oscar for best supporting beast The only returning character is Xixo KEE ko played once again by N xua I think the is a clucking sound made with the tongue used in the Bushman language apparently But the formula is identical It would be pointless to summarize the plot beyond what is said in the capsule the story really isn t important The point of the film is to show the silliness more advanced society can achieve by comparing its members to Xixo and his simpler ways But the message is very gently delivered and even the most staunch conservatives like me will not be put off
0742,Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover The,1989,SUMMARY Not an entertainment but an art film which does not compromise even for the sake of decency its pure visions of beauty cuisine evil greed lust and revenge At times repulsive it nonetheless is a beautifully crafted unique and thought provoking film WARNING As you may have read the MPAA gave this movie an X rating because of its extremely graphic content If you are the least bit squeamish you should not consider seeing this movie and need read no farther Rather than accept the X rating the film s distributor has released it without a rating but no one under 18 is admitted Even with all these warnings more than a few people in the audience walked out at various points I enjoy seeing a movie which makes me think about it for several days after seeing it When this one ended I wasn t sure if I liked it or not Having now thought about it for a few days and realizing that there are certain images from it that I will never forget I want to go see it again I think the first viewing left me numb because it was so unlike anything I had seen before The Thief is Albert a London gangster who is sadistic greedy insensitive and grotesque Michael Gambon who starred in PBS The Singing Detective gives a bravura performance Albert decides to use gourmet dining as a way to gain society s acceptance and show off his wealth He acquires an interest in London s finest French restaurant and holds court there every night with his fellow gangsters and entourage of hoodlums The restaurant is run with perfection by the Cook and its menu and decor are the ultimate in taste and refinement with service beyond reproach The depiction of the various areas of the restaurant in which most of the action takes place is one of the striking aspects of the film The impossibly elegant dining room is dominated by a huge 17th Century Dutch painting and at various times Albert and his gang seem to imitate poses from the painting The perfectly coiffed and dressed diners except for Albert and his crowd and the fabulous food presentations form beautifully composed still lifes The dining room is surrealistically juxtaposed with the cavernous dungeon like kitchen where hygiene is of little concern and dozens of workers endlessly prepare mountains of food A different color is used in each area of the restaurant red for the dining room white for the bathrooms green for the kitchen and blue for the back alley behind the restaurant The color of the costumes change as the characters move from one area to another so that they are always perfectly coordinated And the camera always moves with the characters from area to area In this setting Albert yells at the restaurant staff abuses and attacks the other diners and makes fun of the food As his wife walks towards the bathroom he yells after her to be sure to wipe her bottom His henchman casually vomits down his shirtfront When the girlfriend of one of his henchmen challenges Albert he disfigures her with the silverware And at the beginning of the movie Albert has one of his rivals beat up forced to eat dog feces and urinated on Since Albert now owns the restaurant the Cook can only stand by and watch The passing of time is indicated by shots of the changing daily menu and in the seven days during which the action takes place Albert s long suffering wife Georgina makes eye contact with a solitary diner and quickly starts a passionate affair with him They meet and make love in the restrooms closets and prep rooms of the kitchen at every possible opportunity with the aid of the Cook Being naturally distrustful and suspicious it is only a matter of time before Albert discovers the affair and the tension of the various near escapes is almost unbearable When Albert does find out his revenge on the Lover is horrific But Georgina also gets her revenge and it is just as satisfying for us in the audience The actress who plays Georgina Helen Mirren calls the film a Jacobean drama a form of theater from the days of James I that emphasized tragedy through violent action spectacle and revenge The director Peter Greenaway refuses to discuss its meaning Being so graphic it is not easy to sit through But as Mirren points out this film is no more graphic than the typical teenage slasher movies which routinely get R ratings What makes this more difficult to watch In an article in the San Francisco Chronicle Mirren said This is a film that pushes people s buttons It gets to areas we re most prudish and prurient and embarrassed about It gets under our skin If you don t find it a bit much you re a bit much yourself The San Francisco Chronicle review summed it up nicely What s more important than the graphic nature of the film is that it is a bracingly intelligent and often beautiful work a chilling black comedy that tells its heartless story in a virtuoso style marked by visual elegance and dark ironic wit Anyone able to stomach its graphic imagery will find it an unsettling but unforgettable movie
0743,Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover The,1989,Peter Greenaway s most famous film to this point was THE DRAUGHTSMAN S CONTRACT On the surface that was a mystery set at a country estate Its subtext was that beneath the affected surface of the upper class there is mischief and dirt The style was however very affected and uninvolving and bloodless To be frank I could not wait for the film to end In THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE HER LOVER Greenaway seems once again to have it in for the upper classes or at least for the nouveau riche who dine at a very fine French restaurant as well as for the people who put up letters on theater marquees But this time around the cold and uninvolving style is gone Really gone The film starts like a Monty Python sketch that goes on a bit too long then it fades to John Waters then Herschel Gordon Lewis and when it is all over we find we have been watching an intricately mounted E C Comic and a story that could have been taken from the pages of VAULT OF HORROR or TALES FROM THE CRYPT I laughed my way through the film was delighted by every ghoulish turn but I have to say that I cannot recommend this film to most of the people I know I do not remember when I have seen a film that more people walked out on What we have here is one week behind the scenes at The Restaurant From Hell Actually the restaurant is La Hollandais soon to be known as Spica and Boarst s Richard Boarst is a superb Cordon Bleu class French chef whose restaurant was taken over by gangster Albert Spica Spica does not live by halfway measures He is extremely violent exceptionally loud and rude and supremely vulgar Night after night he holds forth at his restaurant piling vulgarity on vulgarity and often savaging his customers We are led to assume that the cuisine must be very very good for anyone to be willing to sit in the same restaurant as Spica The gangster repeatedly brutalizes his wife Georgina whom he virtually holds prisoner Georgina however is able to sneak away from Spica occasionally to rendezvous with a rather studious quiet customer Michael with whom she makes passionate love Greenaway who wrote as well as directed has written what could well have been a stage play There are only a very limited number of sets and the sets are designed for use of color and for effect rather than for accuracy First we see the parking lot infested with a veritable army of stray dogs The kitchen is a hilarious revelation of what goes on behind the scenes at a fancy restaurant What goes on in the kitchen is unbelievable The transition from this kitchen that you would not feed a dog from to the ultra posh dining room stuns the viewer And so it goes from one room to the next Michael Gambon plays Spica and must speak two thirds of the lines in the film He never shuts up and he never says anything you want to hear Gambon was good in the BBC drama THE SINGING DETECTIVE but his Albert Spica will easily eclipse that role Helen Mirren is usually good and this is probably a role that will get more attention than her perhaps better films such as THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE HER LOVER is not really an art film but a ghoulish horror comic book with art film trappings If you see it I cannot promise you will like it but I can promise you that you have not seen any other film like it I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0744,Miami Blues,1990,Alec Baldwin the actor whose performance in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER has catapulted him into the rank of leading men does his level best to sink back down in the odd character roles with his performance in MIAMI BLUES In a riveting comic style that combines the lunacy of Jack Nicholson s Joker with a cold intelligence Baldwin plays a rotten SOB in a way that s fun at times hysterical to watch This film co produced by the mind behind SOMETHING WILD and MARRIED TO THE MOB has a lot of good spirited eccentricity in common with those two pictures But there s a core of violent meanness to MIAMI BLUES that can t be denied Senses of sex and killing are kept on screen too long for the dark comedy to be much of a lark at times But it is the relationships and not the plot that make MIAMI BLUES one of the best spring releases Alec Baldwin s psycho his former hooker girlfriend Jennifer Jason Leigh and the poor cop Fred Ward are such fully realized characters that their interaction is on its own fun to watch even if nothing is happening A scene between Ward and Leigh in a supermarket and Baldwin and Leigh at a dinner date are both truly captivating moments Even minor supporting parts such as a female cop who has disdain for Ward because he loses his gun badge and false teeth to Baldwin have fire in them the female cop and Ward have this unspoken sexual dynamic motivating their treatment of each other The script never addresses it but in a scene where the female cop arrives at Ward s door dressed in an evening gown for her impending date and Ward answers in his boxer shorts and underwear there s a weird game going on between them That s an example of why this film is so good But there are also a few examples of why it can be so bad Two shockingly violent episodes occur in the film not ferocious but still unnerving to the point that entire rows of audience members were cringing and speaking to the screen when most folks don t ever do that sort of thing and the entire film has a level of violence akin to the MIAMI VICE show and many action films though MIAMI BLUES is not an action film per se If an orgy of violence wasn t such a regular occurrence in movies MIAMI BLUES would be regarded as one of the year s most inspired films But because we Americans are fed so much violence the novelty and the amount of relevance of MIAMI BLUES fable of crime and consequence is a little thin But for the performances of the three principal performers and some unusual film techniques it s definitely worth seeing
0745,Martians Go Home,1990,I don t know how Randy Quaid and Elizabeth Perkins got involved with this movie Their agents must have owed some producers a favor or two I did not see anything resembling advertising for this movie except for an ad in the movie section of the local newspaper Randy Quaid plays one of those musicians who gets stuck writing music for TV cop shows and low budget game shows He gets a break and is offered the chance to write the soundtrack for a science fiction movie He leaps at the chance and through an accident his music is broadcast on a radio station that his girlfriend or wife played by Elizabeth Perkins works at Somehow the people of the planet Mars hear it and are summoned to Earth At this point I d like to say that the ad for the movie calls the invasion of the Martians as One billion comedians come to entertain us only the joke is on us Well the joke is on the viewers of the movie who shelled out money to pay for it The comedians should have been called annoying relatives who come for a visit They look like polyester clad green people They show up and disrupt life on Earth much in the same way that gonged people on the old Gong Show would The humor is awful Anyway Randy Quaid discovers a way to send the Martians away how I don t know and attempts to do so The pity is that he didn t think of it sooner One of the few times I actually laughed was when they made a little jab at French filmmaking They cut to the outside of an apartment in Paris and we hear a woman and man talking to each other The conversation goes something like Man Life is meaningless There is only pain suffering and bitterness A Martian appears through the miracle of sound effects Woman Look There is a Martian standing on our sofa Man So Nothing has changed There is still only bitterness Woman But now there is only bitterness and green men This is a movie that I wouldn t recommend to anyone When I saw it there were only three people in the theater myself included At least the couple that showed up could enjoy each other s company Unfortunately I make it policy to stay through any movie that I go to in a theater I considered leaving from this one
0746,Q & A,1990,I generally claim that a film can tell the same story you could tell in forty to sixty pages of prose That rule is not infallible Q A is a long film at 132 minutes but it is amazing how much happens in the course of this realistic thriller looking at police and politics It is difficult to believe this hard edged film could have been directed by the same man who last year directed the much softer FAMILY BUSINESS Q A is complex and frankly difficult to follow with many more major characters than one expects to see in a film It is nice to see a film that does not talk down to its audience even if perhaps it goes a little far in the other direction Not making the film any easier to follow much of the dialogue is spoken in realistically thick accents Q A opens with policeman Mike Brennan played by Nick Nolte murdering a Puerto Rican drug pusher and then intimidating witnesses into saying the dead man pulled a gun on him Called in purportedly to investigate but actually to whitewash is Al Reilly played by Timothy Hutton the new D A s assistant Reilly was formerly a policeman and the son of a much loved legend on the police force The case does look simple enough to start with but a friend tips off Reilly that there may be more going on than is immediately apparent The more Reilly digs the more he finds His chief subject Brennan is a big easy man instantly likable and quickly detestable He has an open love of crude though often funny ethnic jokes that soon gives way to an obvious racism Brennan is finding himself in an increasingly multi ethnic multi racial New York and resents how things have changed since the good old days In fact there are many ethnic and other minorities represented in the plot virtually every important character is from a minority and the hatred each group has for the others is part of what the story is about The plot involves Irish Italians Puerto Ricans gays and Jews Sephardic and Ashkenazic The plot also involves a D A with higher political aspirations played by Patrick O Neal and a drug runner played by Armand Asante involved with both the victim and with Reilly s former fiancee There is no chance I can do a reasonable job of explaining a complex and highly inter woven plot such as Q A in a paragraph or two Q A has a very downbeat feel to it without the sorts of heroes this sort of film would usually have Lumet is not trying to make us like his characters but instead just wants us to see the way things are It is set in a New York City that is as easily recognizable by the feel as by the buildings The music is by Rube n Blades who also wrote the song under the titles Blades incidentally is reportedly very likely to announce soon his candidacy for the presidency of Panama For Lumet Q A represents a return to a more serious style of filmmaking such as his PRINCE OF THE CITY I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0747,Guardian The,1990,Well The Phantom must say that he has always been an admirer of the film reviews in the New York Times unlike the simple minded thumbs who review films on television the Times reviewers are critics in the best sense of the word and their reviews are always well considered and informative So one can understand how flattered the Phantom felt when he read the lead paragraph of Ms Maslin s review Yet it behooves him to ask Now who s reading whose reviews here Alas if only the Phantom got Ms Maslin s free preview tickets let alone her salary But for him it is enough to know that he has found another phan on the staff of his favorite daily Though clever Maslin s lead paragraph is also very misleading To be fair the Phantom never expects accurate reviews of horror films from the Times but Maslin seems to have missed the point of THE GUARDIAN Like most horror films THE GUARDIAN doesn t exist to teach us a lesson unless one thinks that Don t go in the basement is a lesson Instead THE GUARDIAN exists only to entertain and to scare us and in that capacity it does a very good job indeed So let s start with a brief summary THE GUARDIAN is yet another in a long line of mainstream adult horror films Like THE EXORCIST also by the director William Friedkin THE OMEN and more recently CHILD S PLAY THE GUARDIAN is a horror film designed to appeal to those people who would not otherwise go to a horror film And while it s not nearly as successful THE EXORCIST or THE OMEN it works about as well as CHILD S PLAY though whether it does as well at the box office remains to be seen in other words it s not a classic but it s pretty good in it s own way The story is fairly simple if a tad unusual Imagine if you will that the Druids were right that trees really do have spirits and can exert influence over people and the world around them Now imagine that one of these Druids is also a nanny Still with me OK now to complete our mental picture imagine that one of the trees an evil tree demands human sacrifices particularly infant sacrifices Certainly by its very nature THE GUARDIAN gives THE FIRST POWER a run for its money as this year s silliest horror film But although it sounds fairly outlandish once you buy the premise THE GUARDIAN is a lot of fun Unlike THE FIRST POWER THE GUARDIAN starts out silly and stays that way in general the Phantom prefers films that work like this rather than ones like THE FIRST POWER that start out sensible and promising and end up in a big muddle THE GUARDIAN begins with a bit of explanation it seems that the producers don t believe that their audience would understand what Druids are without three or four screens worth of explanation Unfortunately the preamble reminded the Phantom of nothing less than a cross between the Stonehenge sequence from THIS IS SPINAL TAP and the disclaimer at the beginning of SCARFACE Briefly the producers want to be sure that everyone understands that the Druids were an ancient religious sect that worshipped trees and that while most Druids and presumably most trees are fine upstanding members of their communities and or forests some are just bad seeds real rotten apples trees and disciples that have gone over to the Dark Side The Phantom apologizes in advance if he didn t get this part exactly right but he thinks that this was the general idea Why these trees are evil is never explained perhaps they re tired of being turned into press releases and fax paper or maybe they ve been cheated out of their residuals for THE WIZARD OF OZ but honestly neither the Phantom nor the twelve year olds he was surrounded by required further explanation Evil trees No problem Once you buy into pizza eating turtles and stunt nuns your tolerance for cinematic silliness goes way up Now the Phantom would normally take some time here to further describe the plot but in this case it s hardly necessary and in fact it might possibly spoil the film for some THE GUARDIAN is not a film that is loaded with surprises so the Phantom would feel worse than usual if he gave some of them away Disappointed Oh all right then let s give some of them away anyway Here goes Couple hires nanny nanny cares for infant nanny communes with evil tree nanny takes infant couple chases nanny you get the idea Surprised Well surprisingly there are some surprises For one there are several OMEN like killings done with 90s style special effects and gore For another the film doesn t plod along in TV movie of the week fashion the editing camera work and cinematography are all top notch Friedkin hasn t lost his touch since his days of directing Linda Blair amidst buckets of pea soup THE GUARDIAN looks and feels a lot like the EXORCIST did and the Phantom enjoyed that expert look and feel more than he did almost anything else about the film The Phantom was particularly disappointed with Maslin s review in this respect she complains that Friedkin concentrates too much on things decorative and sets up shots in forests and meadows so that viewers are apt to notice wildflowers in the foreground Oh dear Isn t that the point This film is after all about evil Druids so one would think that placing the characters in the context of the wildlife surrounding them would be important Much better this than the relatively uninspired camera work of THE FIRST POWER to pick on our favorite silly horror film yet again For film buffs Friedkin has also scattered several inside references throughout THE GUARDIAN the Phantom caught at least three and as the film progresses it also becomes obvious that Friedkin is nearly as big a phan of EVIL DEAD as is the Phantom himself the basement scene in particular is strikingly reminiscent of one of the scenes in EVIL DEAD Phans who want the inside track should pay particularly close attention to the radio programs that are overheard on occasion And those who are not into gore for gore s sake may want to consider playing peek a boo during some scenes the Phantom himself was surprised at how far some of the violence went especially given the supposed mainstream nature of this film Unlike say HELLBOUND which was never intended to appeal to non horror phans THE GUARDIAN appears on the surface to have been designed to appeal to people who don t normally appreciate a good dismemberment To be fair it never gets nearly as bad as HELLBOUND in fact the gore level is about on a par with one of the OMEN sequels though nary a priest is wrapped in plastic and set on fire but there are a few scenes that would do Romero proud These trees don t kill people by dropping acorns on their heads you know The acting is adequate with the exception of Jenny Seagrove whose performance as the evil nanny is not in the least wooden and baby Jake is definitely cute even though he is portrayed at times by in Maslin s words a screaming pile of towels The special effects are generally well done and although Friedkin seems to have used the same backlot forest that was featured in LEATHERFACE last year the meadows are scenic and the film does its best to imbue what are after all just a bunch of plants with evil and ill meaning intentions The Phantom really recommends this one phans despite its astoundingly silly plot and despite some of the negative reviews it has garnered THE GUARDIAN is a good solid 90 minutes of fun with enough scares to keep even the most jaded horror film buff on his toes It s worth catching before it makes its Blockbusters debut Yes all right that one was a bit of a stretch Just be glad the Phantom couldn t come up with a good pun for druid
0749,Nuovo cinema Paradiso,1988,It is just after World War II in Giancaldo a small town in Sicily Life is hard troubles are large and most pleasures are small One pleasure is big bigger than the richest man in town It is the big screen down at the Cinema Paradiso The big screen tells big stories stories of tortured love action stories musicals with big production numbers And in front of the big screen is a small boy Toto To Toto there is school there is sleep there is work there is food and there are movies The first four are mundane and leave Toto in Giancaldo Movies are magical and can take him any place in the world from the houses of the rich to the Wild West To Toto not just the stories are magical but the theater is also with its bright beam coming from a sculptured lion s mouth Toto has even sneaked a look at the machine that makes the picture and at old Alfredo the irritable man who runs the machine that makes the movies For Toto to get closer to the movies he will have to make friends with Alfredo and maybe learn how Alfredo runs the projector Thus begins a life long friendship between young Salvatore called Toto and Alfredo the poor projectionist And the friendship is built around the love both have for the movies Set against the backdrop of the Sicilian peasant village the story shows Salvatore himself become a projectionist we see him grow up and fall in love The story is told in flashback as it is remembered by the adult Salvatore on the night that he has heard of Alfredo s death CINEMA PARADISO directed and written by Giuseppe Tornetore is full of loving detail about the post war movie exhibition business and has many endearing portraits of the Sicilian peasants who mob the theater to get a touch of something that transcends their unglamorous lives Ennio Morricone scored this film originally three hours in length shown in Italy at two and a half hours in 1988 and cut to about two hours for American audiences This is a sentimental and endearing film that will be well remembered I rate it a low 3 on the 4 to 4 scale Note for those who have seen the film spoiler for those who have not The following is a quote from the VARIETY 11 23 88 review of the film then called NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO It reveals an important plot twist edited out of the version released in this country Salvatore returns to Sicily for Alfredo s funeral and finds his long lost love now played by Brigitte Fossey Amid many tears Salvatore learns it was his blind friend who broke up this one true romance of his life In fact it was a weakness of the film that that loose end was never tied up Apparently the American distributor did not want Alfredo to be made less sympathetic though anybody who steals pieces of films is not particularly sympathetic as far as I am concerned
0750,Marquis,1989,Synopsis Costume drama set in France at the time of the revolution 1788 89 centered on the activities of the Marquis deSade Unlike other films on the subject all the actors in this film wear animal masks and portray animals Raunchy and very sick the film is filled with S M political humor and phony bestiality One redeeming social virtue it s outrageously funny Belgium France English subtitles color 1989 83 minutes Director Writer Henri Xhonneux Creature Design Art Director Roland Topor This film deals with two years in the life of the Marquis who is imprisoned in the infamous Bastille for religious crimes The Marquis spends his time in prison writing the dirty S M fantasy stories for which he is famous and talking with his huge nearly a meter long phallus which has a human face and talks back His phallus has a rather unique and impulsive view of life and serves as a literary critic as well The Marquis has the face of a dog but his other features are human The jailer has the face of a rat is bisexual and lusts for the Marquis The plot of the film concerns the political intrigue surrounding the Marquis who is blamed for impregnating a woman who has the face of a cow she was really raped by the King Additionally revolutionaries are plotting the overthrow of the monarchy and want to release certain prisoners they ask for help from the Marquis in their plot That s all I will reveal of the plot to avoid any spoilers This is certainly the strangest film I have seen in some time and also one of the funniest The animal masks costumes are very well done and make a strong realistic impression on the viewer The result is a film that lies between animation and live action Perhaps it could be described as similar to the Muppets but done by someone on drugs with a truly warped sense of humor This is not a film for everyone It is very funny but also very dirty sexual humor at times and there is plenty of S M and some blood gore There is some clay animation in the film which is used to portray certain of the more violent fantasies of the Marquis which might be offensive to some viewers Because of the subject matter the film is not suitable for children prudes the squeamish the humor impaired or anyone with an attitude problem The film should appeal to those with an offbeat very raunchy sense of humor Note also that despite its sexual nature there appears to be no genuine explicit sex in it However it is worth seeing if your tastes include the bizarre Distribution U S premiere now in progress at the San Francisco Int l Film Festival Next showings Friday Saturday 5 11 12 at the AMC Kabuki Theater in San Francisco No information on future release plans Print Source Constellation Productions 108 rue des Dames 75017 Paris France
0751,Black Rain,1989,Film Black Rain Director Ridley Scott Starring Michael Douglas Andy Garcia Ken Takakura and Kate Capshaw You may be familiar with another Scott film BLADERUNNER BLADERUNNER was taught and suspenseful The sets were perfect The mood was indelible The characters were distinctive and the acting was superior Years after seeing the movie even only seeing it once images of the film come to mind easily In short it was an evocatively stylish film Although BLACK RAIN shares some of those attributes it s very far below the standard set by BLADERUNNER Still the film is interesting as much for its failures as its successes The cinematography is superb The film shows Japan as a very foreign country The three lead characters are well above average in their portrayals of flesh and blood people And the directing editing is excellent With all those things going for it you may well wonder why reviewers including this one have generally found this film substandard One reviewer even criticized Michael Douglas merely for taking on the role he plays in this movie That critic felt Douglas was capitalizing literally on the current wave of dislike fear scorn of all things Japanese Other reviewers have also taken pot shots at the story line The movie deserves this treatment from reviewers You see there were so many possibilities here We could ve seen an exploration of morals that transcend cultural bounds Looked at the definition of good and bad Explored the way that different societies deal with violence and scum What we get instead is an action movie with a xenophobic view of Japan A cheap shot A waste of talent We are tantalized with glimpses of what the movie could ve been The one theme that is actually explored is the universality of honor But we only get little shimmering glances of intelligence in a film that could ve delivered magnitudes more punch So what s it about you ask Well it s about America vs Japan It s about the utter lack of comprehension and the contempt that Americans have about the Japanese It s about scum violence and honor Two American policemen journey to Japan with an extradited Japanese scumball The scumball is being returned to Japan courtesy of the U S But the Japanese police don t get their guy because of uhm a handoff problem The rest of the film pits the Americans against the Japanese as they attempt to recapture the scum And herein lies the central problem of the movie Do we get to see how the Japanese handle the scum of their society Do we see how the well established well understood hierarchy within the Japanese police works when apprehending criminals Do we learn anything from the Japanese Hell no They re portrayed as well inept Formal and inept Ritualized and incapable It s up to the Great White Hope And in case anyone in the audience has trouble picking up on facial expressions and body language the screenwriters make sure that we hear Douglas and Garcia the two Americans voicing unrestrained contempt for the Japanese Racism Not just lack of understanding The language and the attitude communicated contempt but I m sure that was just supposed to explain to us how very far the Americans would have to travel to cross over the cultural bridge The screenwriters would sincerely protest their script being called racist they probably thought it was exactly the opposite Where the scriptwriters went wrong was in the foundation of the story that there would need to be a Great White Hope to save the day in Japan That an American maverick with complete disregard and contempt for a foreign culture would come to respect exactly one Japanese man And that this would be symbolic and would somehow let the film off the racist hook Nope As beautifully communicated as some of the moments are between Douglas and Takakura the one Japanese man shown in a favorable light those moments do not redeem the movie So it s flawed Very fatally flawed But it s captivating and there are about ten minutes of truly fine ensemble acting If you re offended by the kind of racism that reviewers criticized in MISSISSIPPI BURNING don t see BLACK RAIN It s got the same type of problem If you are a Douglas fan you ll probably but not necessarily like this film If you like Ridley Scott movies you ll probably be a bit disappointed Having read the reviews of BLACK RAIN my own decision was to wait for it to come out on video I m sure it was more visually satisfying on the big screen but I ll sacrifice that in exchange for a 1 88 rental in many cases This is one of them And it s probably even worth 3 00
0752,Tales from the Darkside: The Movie,1990,The Phantom has always been an avid admirer of Steven King and George Romero so when CREEPSHOW was released in 1982 the Phantom was first in line to see it Although it does not rank as one of the best or even one of the better horror films of all time it did have a certain unique style and charm and it combined just the right amounts of humor camp gross outs and scares to keep its audience entertained throughout its five short tales of terror CREEPSHOW was also the first horror film in a long while to present short ghost stories rather than one full length tale Since then however there have been several films that have attempted CREEPSHOW s unique style some like TWILIGHT ZONE THE MOVIE and CREEPSHOW 2 succeeded in part others like NIGHTMARES and CAT S EYE failed utterly and have since been relegated to positions of honor right behind the Big Gulp displays in 7 11s across the country The Phantom has also been an on again off again admirer of the television show Tales From the Darkside the shows never seemed consistently good enough to watch on a regular basis and the enlightened station managers of the shadowy independent television stations on which Tales is broadcast tend to hide the show on sunny weekend afternoons and late on weekday nights between thirty minute hair replacement system commercials and six hour long No Money Down scams so it was with high hopes that the Phantom went to see TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE THE MOVIE The Phantom apologizes profusely for that last sentence and invites his phans to take a moment to catch their breath before going on to the next After all the best episodes on Tales are quite good at least as good as any of the classic Twilight Zone episodes and the majority are frequently innovative and clever Besides the Phantom is also a sucker for anything Romero does and has been ever since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD Since he and King did such a good job with CREEPSHOW it stands to reason that TALES would be a worthy sequel But alas the ads for TALES tell tales themselves The film is promoted as being from Romero and King but in fact only one of the three tales is from them And that one tale Cat From Hell isn t even directed by Romero instead he and King co wrote it The Phantom is not of course disappointed that King didn t direct any or all of the film ever since MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE the Phantom has been awakening with cold sweats over the prospect that King might once again be allowed to step behind a camera and inflict another of his cinematic visions upon his adoring and naive public The tip off should have been the credit given to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who even when alive had little experience writing or directing horror films Now that Sir Arthur is no longer with us his being listed as one of the from s should have sounded warning bells of fraudulent advertising at least and tedious and predictable horror tales at worst But tedious and predictable do not do TALES justice This is a horror film for people who do not like surprises or perhaps people who are always 20 minutes behind Angela Lansbury each Sunday evening As the film plodded from one chilling tale to the next the Phantom found himself wondering whether it were still possible to make a horror film that was neither ridiculous like our friends THE FIRST POWER and THE GUARDIAN nor tedious And he nearly fainted dead away in disbelief when the first tale turned out to be about a mummy that no the Phantom won t give away the chilling surprise Oh all right the mummy ACTUALLY COMES TO LIFE AND KILLS PEOPLE EEEK The Phantom was so scared he nearly dropped his popcorn Scarier still is the thought that even Sir Arthur who unfortunately is given Inspired by a story by credit is not as old as this threadbare tale If only Bud and Lou were still alive One would think that the director John Harrison who directed the entire film would have learned from the horrifyingly bad Cigar Store Indian tale in CREEPSHOW 2 dead things and or inanimate objects coming to life went out with Karloff and Lugosi and in fact it s been nearly 60 years since someone made a good horror film that featured a mummy Hammer Films knew how to do it then but alas neither Sir Arthur nor John Harrison seem to know how to do it now Sir Arthur at least has the excuse of being otherwise occupied decomposing at the moment so we can forgive him but Michael McDowell who also worked on BEETLEJUICE is still among the living and can therefore still be held responsible for his script Of the two tales that follow only Cat From Hell is interesting and then only because of Buster Poindexter s outrageous performance as a feline hit man The final tale Lover s Vow features some very nice creature effects done by FX wizard Dick Smith but as its plot line is more transparent than the film stock on which it develops the Phantom will refrain from summarizing it here for fear that it might bubble and blacken under the bright light of criticism The film would be a near total letdown if it were not for the wrapper segments that feature a perfectly cast and perfectly unflappable Deborah Harry as a slightly deranged housewife planning a dinner party Her performance in TALES is nearly as entertaining as were the comic book segues in CREEPSHOW and she gives us all something to stick around for as each tale slowly drowns under the weight of an impossible load of exposition That exposition is the central problem with TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE well that and the fact that darkside has been confounding the Phantom s spell checker all evening if ghost stories told around a campfire were told like this all the campers would be fast asleep before the teller could even get to the first cliche By the way for those phans who may avoid this film even after it supplants the other 24 hour favorites behind the Big Gulp display the Phantom wishes to point out that yes the mummy tale does indeed contain the celebrated closeup of mummy s hand as it emerges from coffin scene Happy 60th birthday Mr Scene How we ve enjoyed you through the years In fact the Phantom now understands at least one reason why CREEPSHOW was so much fun each of its tales was short sweet and to the point Romero has always understood that horror films are different from other kinds of films in that they exist solely to scare their audiences not to engross them with complex character relationships and witty repartee not that TALES could be said to boast either of these So perhaps Romero could have saved TALES but perhaps not There seems to have been so little effort put into this film that its title could be more appropriately TALES FROM THE DIM SIDE the film which like the television show on which it is loosely based is a Laurel production so Romero must have had more to do with it than he s letting on but sadly TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE is a film that will garner no one s laurels Fortunately there is an alternative for those phans who decide not to subject themselves to the small screen entertainment of TALES FROM THE DARK SIDE a small odd but very effective horror film now in limited release called BRAIN DEAD The Phantom saw BRAIN DEAD on a Times Square double bill with TALES that is he saw TALES first then ran across Broadway in a desperate search for something that even remotely resembled a horror film and he was very glad he did He will have a full review of it next week along with a review of Mark Lester s CLASS OF 1999 but for those phans who have an opportunity to see it the Phantom heartly recommends BRAIN DEAD Coincidentally BRAIN DEAD was written by Charles Beaumont one of the original writers for The Twilight Zone and it heartened the Phantom to see a horror film that was well written intelligent and contained no mummies
0753,Thiassos O,1975,This is a review of a film that I saw at the recent AFI Los Angeles Film Festival More reviews of films I saw there will probably follow For a summary of the festival see rec arts cinema There s a small unusual genre of films I call Red Tragedies Red as in Communist What is a Red Tragedy Well by and large Communists do not give much thought to individuals Their concern is the collective So clearly a Red Tragedy is a tragedy that happens to all of a country s workers not just to one bourgeois or worse aristocratic person or family And there s only one event sufficiently shattering for a Red Tragedy the failure of a Communist revolution That s why the genre is small The filmmaker has to be in sympathy with Communism to begin with Then he has to live in a country where the Communists failed to take over Countries where they did have neither the need to bemoan the failure nor as we have seen lately much general sympathy for the idea that such a failure would be a tragedy Moreover the existing government has to be sufficiently liberal to permit someone to wail about the failure of a revolution And finally there actually has to be enough money in the country to make a film 1900 is probably the most famous Red Tragedy Bertolucci tried to make us feel the classical tragedy of the failure of the peasants to take over Italy instead of the Fascists Having Fascists around to stack the deck certainly helps put a Red Tragedy across but Bertolucci s film while greatly entertaining was not a success in the U S and probably didn t convert anyone THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is a Red Tragedy from Greece made by Greek director Theo Angelopolous I doubt if it will find much favor in the U S either It s just as long as 1900 has no familiar actors has much the same point of view and isn t particularly entertaining at least not for audiences yearning for more kung fu reptiles However this film was not made with wowing American audiences in mind THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is a Greek film for Greek audiences Anyone else must watch it as an outsider separated from the themes of the film by culture and history The plot of THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is Aeschylus Orestia superimposed lightly on the fortunes of a group of actors travelling around Greece performing a bucolic tragedy The film starts just before the Second World War and continues through the troubling times Greece faced after the war when a civil war broke out between the right and left wings The leader of the company is the Agamemnon figure his wife is Clytemnestra and they have two children actually named Orestes and Electra You d think that Greek actors would know better than to choose those names for their children The company s leader favors the leftists in Greece The wife s lover is a Fascist When war breaks out Agamemnon goes off to fight And the classical tragedy plays out Slowly Very very slowly THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is ten minutes short of four hours if they don t give you an intermission Angelopolous has made a very unengaging film The characters have no reality They exist almost as icons except that most of them do not carry any meaning either Certainly they never give the impression of being real people and Angelopolous didn t seem to intend that they should They are practically placeholders human hooks to hang not a story but a political and historical lesson on Nor is there much that could pass for action Shots are fired people are murdered adulterers adulter but these incidents are not punched up to excite or entertain Combining with the remoteness of the characters and the distancing of conventional plotting Angelopolous has a distinctive cinematic style that is rather Brechtian in the way it distances audiences from the story In the entire three hours and fifty minutes of THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS Angelopolous uses only 80 shots Some of these shots are 8 minutes or so This style has some obvious implications We see none of the conventional handling of conversations for instance where two shots showing both actors are interspersed with close ups of the performers Of course there aren t very many conversations in THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS anyway Angelopolous camera is not static however He uses many complicated camera movements in this film But they too are very very slow He will take 30 seconds or a minute to pan around 180 degrees It is an unnatural and sometimes disturbing slowness not at all like the way people move their heads to look at things At its worst this style makes the viewer want to leap up and forcibly push the camera to where it s obviously creeping At its best it encourages the viewer to take a closer unblinking look at details that are usually lost by snappier photographic styles Perhaps the most amazing thing about THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is that despite the extreme length despite the unengaging characters despite the overstretched plot despite the long takes and languid camera THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is still not really dull It s not fascinating exciting pulse pounding but it s not quite dull either I never felt like going to sleep leaving the theater conversing with my neighbor or doing anything other than watching the film Angelopolous has a hypnotic effect of some kind That the camera work is quite beautiful undoubtedly helps but the director clearly has the sort of talent that allows him to work in a style that would not work for almost anyone else Also Angelopolous achieves some fine moments in the film Perhaps the best is a showdown in a dance hall between leftists and right wing supporters during the civil war In a single extended shot Angelopolous uses music and dance to show the conflict between the factions the final triumph of the conservatives the violence behind that triumph and the frightening ideology the right wing represents It s one of the finest five or ten minutes of film I ve seen this year and serves as a summary of the whole film Another fine moment is when an American soldier marries a Greek girl A traditional wedding song sung by an old lady is cheerfully brainlessly corrupted into boogie woogie by the American guests It s a perfect example of the heedless naive way that Americans ignore usurp and unwittingly crush foreign cultures without even realizing that they are doing anything wrong Unfortunately these highly insightful moments are separated by lengthy scenes that have no intellectual or emotional impact to speak of Still THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is moderately effective as a Red Tragedy My knowledge of the Greek civil war is limited and worked from the typical anti Communist assumptions of Americans Angelopolous presentation of the victors as little better than re labeled Fascists and the American and British intervention as hardly an improvement on the German occupation was provocative if nothing else THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is perhaps the quintessential film that s not for everyone It takes patience and a willingness to accept a foreign style This is not a film that was made for universal audiences An American must look at this film as a window on a foreign culture more so than most foreign films THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS is a Greek film about Greek issues for a Greek audience If one can accept its conventions and viewpoint it returns the work put into watching it
0754,Longtime Companion,1990,Monday night I attended the benefit premiere of the new film LONGTIME COMPANION You may have read about it in the ADVOCATE the Los Angeles Times or elsewhere It s the one that follows a small group of friends from 1981 to 1989 as they learn of and battle AIDS From the promotional material LONGTIME COMPANION is a tale of courage and personal heroics a chronicle of people who face an unknown and frightening opponent with love hope and friendship The film is the fictional story of a small circle of friends and changes in their world beginning from that fateful day in 1981 when the first New York Times article noted the outbreak of a rare cancer in the gay community known today as AIDS Directed by Norman Rene written by Craig Lucas starring Bruce Davison and others produced by Stan Wlodkowski and Lindsay Law distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Co This is an important and difficult movie the first big screen attempt to tell the story we all know It is a true to life unsparing chronicle of a generation of gay men There s a lot there Gay Men s Health Crisis ACT UP Louise Hay hospitals home care friendship love anger despair and the full panoply of awful AIDS acronyms PCP KS Toxo CMV HIV It s not fully representative how could it be It does an outstanding job of portraying what has happened in the lives of many gay white men in the last decade those of us who grew up metaphorically speaking in the wild exhilarating 70s only to crash into AIDS in the 80s Despite the subject matter there are many funny moments Some of them are brief lines often alluding to some part of gay life And the final scene which hit me unawares is just right It gave me chills I can t imagine how this movie will fare at the box office outside of the gay community although anyone concerned about the world around us should see this film if only to learn about a story that s been largely ignored except for sensationalized accounts If you care about honest media treatment for lesbians and gays if you are gay and you want to see all of our other stories equally well covered support this one
0756,Thin Blue Line The,1988,Though I m probably the last person on Earth to see it I had to comment on what a remarkable documentary THE THIN BLUE LINE is This Errol Morris film about the Randall Dale Adams capital murder case actually prompted a man s release from a life sentence If there s any more tangible evidence of film s power to influence change I have yet to find it For those who don t know about Adams he was convicted in the late 70s on the charge of killing a Dallas police officer Robert Wood was shot five times at close range as he approached a car for a routine traffic stop because its lights were off By all indications he was going to let the driver off with a warning but he never got the chance The driver sped off as Wood bled to death on a busy West Dallas street This event alone is tragic Wood was a young officer with a wife and though it was November his Christmas present was already bought and hidden at home a bulletproof vest to keep him safe But the tragedy involves more than Wood because a look at the evidence of the case and the dubious credibility of key witnesses for the prosecution shows that the crime had another victim Randall Dale Adams Adams a drifter from Ohio had only recently stopped in Dallas and taken a job in the weeks before the killing He was still living at a motel in a low rent part of Dallas County On Thanksgiving Weekend on his way home from work early because his bosses had decided not to open for business Adams ran out of gas and was walking with a gas can in hand when a man stopped his car and offered him a ride That was David Harris a 16 year old West Texas teen The two men spent a shiftless day together grabbing a burger drinking beers going to a B movie at a drive in and according to Harris smoking marijuana That night at 12 30 a m someone in Harris car shot Wood to death Because of that fact the stories of the two men are dramatically different about the last few hours of that day Adams said he was tired of hanging out with Harris mainly because the teen carried several guns in his car and had even fired one into the air during the day So Adams said he got a lift to his motel and Harris drove off at about 9 or 9 30 p m Harris said after the shooting that he and Adams were still together at midnight and Adams was the driver who fired the shots as Harris cringed in the front seat After Adams was first arrested three witnesses appeared who placed him in the driver s seat moments before the shootings On its face this may seem like an open and shut case against Adams and to renowned Dallas County prosecutor Doug Mulder it was just that However Adams was a man without a criminal record who had gotten a ride from Harris while Harris was driving a car he had stolen which contained guns he had stolen Who had more to lose when Robert Wood approached the car After the crime Harris went back to his native Vidor and bragged about killing a cop a story he changed after meeting with police In THE THIN BLUE LINE Morris brings out these details and other damning evidence against the legal system in Dallas County As a native of Dallas I think I m justified to be frightened and repulsed by the actions of public officials against Adams The presumption of innocence and the idea of justice were completely disregarded in this case Adams calls Dallas a hell on Earth and after his treatment the Linnell Geter case and another two that surfaced this past year I think he s probably right There has been little justice here If you want to see true rent Morris THE THIN BLUE LINE The legal systems we take for granted and expect to perform without failure are often corrupted to appease the public without regard to the rights of innocent people Forget FRIDAY THE 13TH or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET The real horror stories are occurring in courtrooms and prisons
0757,Driving Miss Daisy,1989,I just saw DRIVING MISS DAISY this week and I enjoyed the film because it was made by people who know how to keep quiet The American cinema today is filled with brash boisterous films where shootouts are common and confrontations are as dramatic and polarized as the hero villain relationship in LETHAL WEAPON II The black cop faced South African stooges and the stooges also just happened to be the guys who killed the white cop s beloved wife Can there be a more cut and dried black and white case of justifiable provocation than that Blow em up real good Murtaugh Riggs Hooray In DAISY the biggest confrontations of the whole film involve a can of salmon and an insidiously phrased sentence by a cop The salmon was supposed to be Daisy s evidence that Hoke her black chauffeur was a thief The sentence What kind of name is Werthan showed the true face of racism and anti Semitism It isn t at least not for the vast majority bovine men in hoods with burning torches and rope It is people in power who use their hate to oppress people in seemingly negligible ways because they know they can get away with it The cops saw a nigger and an old Jew woman and decided they were suspicious And they have a right to check out suspicious people That scene with the two policeman sunk into my gut and that sinking was a surprise to me Nothing in MISSISSIPPI BURNING was quite as painful even though it was a painful film about a painful time But DAISY hurt more because it was more real When filmmakers and excellent performers can strip away the excesses of drama and show bits of unmasked reality like that it is an achievement Jessica Tandy Daisy and the film deserved their accolades On a not entirely unrelated note DO THE RIGHT THING was unjustly snubbed Spike Lee is the most real filmmaker to come along in years He has more to say about black America as a segment and part of the whole than any legion of sensitive white liberals in the entertainment business
0758,Ofelas,1987,Capsule review A thousand year old Lapp legend is the basis of this short entertaining occasionally bloody children s film from Lapland that will be entertaining for adults also How often do you get mystical legends in films from Lapland Rating high 1 The plot has been done many times before often but not usually as well But this time there is a good reason for the well worn plot This time it is an adaptation of a millennium old legend from Lapland In the Tenth Century the story was considerably newer Aigin a teenager returns from hunting one day to see his family s camp overrun by marauding invaders the Tchudes His parents and his young sister have been murdered There are about eighteen of these Tchudes all dressed in black and armed to the teeth with crossbows the leader s crossbow is decorated with snarling fangs There is no doubt these are pretty nasty dudes One slip and Aigin is running for his life through the frozen landscape He runs for help to a nearby village but rather than help Aigin they seem more anxious to pack up and run than to fight back So Aigin decides he must fight the Tchudes himself The attraction of THE PATHFINDER is not in the storyline which would be as easily fit to a post Holocaust society and has been many times from ROAD WARRIOR on Where THE PATHFINDER stands out is its depiction of Tenth Century Lapp culture We get little hints of Lapp mysticism and culture We learn superstitions such as the belief that once you have killed a bear your gaze is deadly for three days The entire story is framed in a mystical context in which each person has a totem reindeer who appears at pivotal moments in a person s life This is basically a children s film with a little violence That is more acceptable for children s films in other cultures than it is in ours Still it is a well constructed and filmed children s story and one that adults would enjoy also I would rate it a high 1 At 88 minutes it is a trifle short but it is enjoyable
0759,Yinghung bunsik III,1989,This is the second in a series of reviews of films I saw at the recent AFI Los Angeles Internation Film Festival For a report on the entire festival see rec arts cinema Not too many places outside of Hollywood make Hollywood movies The British do a few the French make comedies sufficiently like American ones to get remade in English Japanese samurai movies used to be rather similar to American Westerns but now both genres are dead That s about it except for Hong Kong Hong Kong makes action adventure films that fit very well into the Hollywood mold except of course that the characters all tend to be Chinese Otherwise you could easily be seeing the product of Warner Brothers or more plausibly New World Cinema They do have their own local twists The culture they come from is different and some of that inevitably shows up in Hong Kong films They don t have quite the budget American studios have so some of the technical aspects of their films are a little rougher By and large the films are set in Hong Kong or China too which aren t the most popular locales for Hollywood films None the less the pacing of the films the subject matter their overall style are very familiar Hong Kong is thus in a good position to steal away a little of the worldwide box office appeal of American films A BETTER TOMORROW and its two sequels are cases in point These are cop films very much like the torrent of cop films flowing out of Hollywood A BETTER TOMORROW is a hybrid of two old formulae the brothers friends who grow up to be on different sides of the law and the criminal tries to go straight despite the urgings of his old buddies The central figure in A BETTER TOMORROW played by Leslie Cheung is a gangster involved in counterfeiting His brother has just joined the police force and early in the film he s caught and sent to jail When he gets out he wants to reform but no one will believe him And in best Hollywood tradition all problems are solved by shooting lots and lots of people There is a typically Chinese concern for family in A BETTER TOMORROW not felt so strongly in American films The greatest desire of the central character is to reconcile with his brother And loyalty is also an important theme more so than in American action pictures Cheung s buddy is being squeezed out of the gang and treated very badly and only by rejoining the gang can Cheung help him But these themes are not played so strongly or with such an exclusively Chinese tone as to make the film seem particularly foreign to American audiences What does make it foreign is the atrocious subtitling A BETTER TOMORROW may have had the worst subtitling job I ve ever seen It appeared to be done by someone with the mistaken belief that he knows English The subtitles veered from unintentionally funny to incomprehensible That s not all that s wrong with A BETTER TOMORROW It sets itself up to be judged by the same standards as American films and by those standards it comes up short The script by John Woo Chan Hing Kai and Leung Suk Wah is rambling and untidy It takes a while to get down to business And the film is technically inferior to a typical American production The cinematography is uninspired at best and lots of small details of special effects sound editing and other background issues are sloppy A single tune is played relentlessly on the score On the other hand the acting is excellent Cheung Chow Yun fatt and Ti Lung instill a sense of reality and likability into their characters One car chase is like another one gunfight is like another so action films really have to rely on their characters to distinguish themselves from the pack The leading actors in A BETTER TOMORROW all have the kind of charisma and style necessary to make their film stand out And director Woo handles the action scenes pretty well The first sequel A BETTER TOMORROW II is similar in tone Actually I liked it better The subtitling had improved there was more action and everything moved faster A dubious plot trick necessitated by the ending of the first film was given no more respect than it deserved showing that the filmmakers weren t deluded about what sort of film they were making It was at its heart more of the same just as LETHAL WEAPON II was more of the same a skillful repetition of the elements of the original that appealed to audiences Being able to recreate the atmosphere in a sequel is actually quite tricky and writer Tsui Hark and co writer and director John Woo pulled it off very well This film also suffers from some of the original s flaws It rambles with an unnecessary side trip to New York City in this case It isn t especially sensible And it s technically a bit rough The third film A BETTER TOMORROW III LOVE AND DEATH IN SAIGON is quite different than its predecessors Set earlier than the first two films it deals with one of the main characters from the first film attempting to help some friends get out of Saigon before the Communist takeover Romance plays a much larger role in this film and it s technically superior to the first two But there s less action and only one of the characters who made the earlier films interesting is here Actually it s really not even the same character just the same actor playing a similar character with the same name There s nothing in the third film to make us believe that he has anything in common with the character in the earlier films New writers Tai Fu Ho and Leung Yiu Ming do not capture the aura of the first film nor does Tsui Hark taking over as director On the whole A BETTER TOMORROW III is the least interesting of these films even though it is the most polished A BETTER TOMORROW I II and III are interesting if for no other reason as rare instances of other nations trying to beat Hollywood at its own game Certainly within Hong Kong they succeeded as all three films were very popular there But somehow I doubt if they will significantly crack the international markets much less the highly lucrative U S market They lack the craft of American commercial films though the artistic level is about the same Which is not necessarily a compliment Lovers of action films will probably get a kick out of them wherever they live and whatever language they speak But Clint Eastwood Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger need not stay awake fretting over a Peril From the East Superficial commercial films from Hong Kong don t beat superficial commercial films from U S Yet
0760,Mahabharata The,1989,Capsule review One of the great stories of world literature fifteen times the length of the BIBLE comes to the screen in a supremely boiled down CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED format Rating low 1 One of the great classics of Western literature is the ILIAD an account told in poetry of a great war in which the gods participated The telling has deep mythic meanings Virtually the same description applies to the great classic of Indian literature the MAHABHARATA The mammoth poem of 90 000 couplets is told in eighteen volumes and is fifteen times as long as the BIBLE It was written roughly around the time the NEW TESTAMENT was The story traces the causes and fighting of a civil war in the land of Kurus The land was captured by the blind man Dhrtarastra Being blind he was considered unfit to rule and gave the kingdom to his younger brother Pandu who ruled for only a short time before returning Kurus to his brother Each of the brothers had sons each by supernatural means and the two sets of cousins grew up together Each group of cousins eventually claims Kurus The two groups go to war with each other in spite of the reluctance of Arjuna the leader of the sons of Pandu to make war on members of his own family Sound familiar Right This is the war that was the setting for the BHAGAVAD GITA In fact the GITA was adapted into the MAHABHARATA Hey I m impressed you picked up on that You must be a whole bunch more erudite than you look Peter Brook produced THE MAHABHARATA as a nine hour play and as two films a 321 minute version for television and a 171 minute version theatrical version Brook s work in film is perhaps a little too similar to his stage work This is a story that really cries out for spectacle as giant armies fight Instead Brook puts his camera right into the action so we never see more than a tiny piece of the action Doing a story fifteen BIBLEs long in a film even a film almost three hours is a feat that is just barely possible and perhaps just a tad misguided I knew the basic story going into the theater and I still found myself at a loss to remember all the important characters and relationships Perhaps the proper medium for this film is on videotape that can be stopped and replayed allowing the viewer to make notes This film was funded by an incredible list of organizations including Finnish public television American public television Britain s Channel 4 and a bunch more I either did not recognize or cannot remember Perhaps it was for that reason that Brook has the very odd racial mixture he has in the casting Presumably the story should be told mostly with Indians Instead it is told with Indians Chinese Blacks Americans British Italians and probably several more With most of the characters coming from one family this is a distraction at best and occasionally adds confusion And confusion is one thing this telling has in more than sufficient quantities It is somehow understating the case to call THE MAHABHARATA an ambitious failure To bring a great work of such length to the screen you must cut very very much more than you leave in What remains you have to force feed your audience at a rate faster than most can assimilate it Many in my audience gave up and there was a notable rash of watch checking It is a good introduction to one of the great works of world literature but it is scarcely more than an introduction The adaptation written by Jean Claude Carriere gives us at once not enough and far too much As a mix of very good mediocre and misguided I would prefer not to rate it but if I must I would give it a low 1
0761,Cadillac Man,1990,CADILLAC MAN stars Robin Williams as Joey O Brien a car salesman in New York The first third of the film documents his various personal problems he s juggling relationships with four women owes a mobster 20 000 and will lose his job the next day unless he sells twelve new cars He is eventually put in a situation in which he ll have to reverse his losing streak or he ll lose his life The movie sounds trite and it is to a degree It s essentially yet another platform for Williams to strut his stuff and is vaguely reminiscent of GOOD MORNING VIETNAM The principal gag is that Joey can argue himself out of anything but life is conspiring to make it all an up hill battle The production quality however raises it out of the gutter it has a good supporting cast and isn t quite as clear cut as the advertisements make out There are a number of good gags both subtle and overt It won t have people rolling in the aisles but it has its moments I d give it a 6 10 or three stars It s a feel good Christmassy sort of flick It won t be the blockbuster of the summer but then again films released in mid May rarely are
0762,Bird on a Wire,1990,BIRD ON A WIRE is the latest star vehicle for Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn It features Gibson as Rick Jarmin Hawn as his ex wife Marianne Graves To cut a very long convoluted story short Gibson s in the Federal Witness Protection Program He has been forced to transfer from invisible job to invisible job over a fifteen year period part of his cover has been to pretend that he s dead He runs into his wife who is now a high powered attorney one day much to her surprise Coincidentally someone who doesn t like him wants him dead and spends a great deal of time trying to do just that Gibson is forced to use her and in the ensuing chase they get to rekindle their earlier romance The story is very very weak and has little more than Hawn looking cute and Gibson posturing There are numerous allusions to Gibson s gluteus maximus it quickly gets boring after a while The rest of the film amounts to gasoline explosions car chases lots of noise the inexplicable bad guys and jokes about the conflict between Gibson s working class character and Hawn s refined character And Guess What Love Triumphs SURPRISE YAWN There are numerous product placements BMW Four Seasons Apple including an obscene user interface on a Mac I don t know why Apple let them do that looks like a PC etc I guess they didn t manage to get an American Express or Visa endorsement but every time Hawn says my gold card her face is away from the camera don t be surprised if it s dubbed in when it comes out on video tape If you want to see yet another film with Gibson as a Sex Symbol Hawn as a Giddy Flake and Carradine as a Bad Guy with an Attitude SEE THIS MOVIE I however was bored out of my mind and judging by all the heads propped on hands near the end everyone else was too Skip it 5 10 two stars It s worth about a buck if you must see it catch it on cable or video I may have been dozing but didn t they technically say that Gibson ran off at the altar If so how could Hawn be the self described grieving widow hotel scene Am I missing something in their use of idiom And the entire premise of the the movie why the hell were these people after Gibson in the first place Why waste the time or effort And why would the people the ex DEA people were doing a deal with want Gibson dead The story has holes one can drive a truck through I can buy Carradine s character wanting Gibson dead but wasn t he just a minion and unlikely to sway the Organization to his point of view Revenge apart why waste time on someone who ceased being a threat fifteen years previously and who obviously wants to be left alone as evidenced by the lack of contacts with the feds The flying scenes were stupid Enough said the real plane helicopter scenes were quite different from the flying models When are filmmakers going to realize that models just don t look like the the real thing I was interested to note though that the helicopter had a G Great Britain prefix while the airplane had an N American prefix Where was this thing filmed The whole zoo scene was idiotic I kept on thinking Don t they feed those animals And why should the animals pass up fresh bloody bait at the end to continue to snap at Gibson dangling from the foot bridge And why would the animal go after Hawn s jacket when she throws it away when it has a nice plump side of meat in front of it Lastly the movie seems to be intended for television virtually no profanity and surprisingly little physical violence Only one Good Guy got waxed the rest of the film showed Rick and Marianne being very careful not to actually hurt the people who were trying to bury them Gibson as pacifist Yeeeesh
0763,Bird on a Wire,1990,After reading Robert Dorsett s review of BIRD ON A WIRE I have but one question did we see the same movie I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and disagree with nearly every point Robert made to the movie s fault I feel I should at least offer this alternative review I ll go approximately in the same order as did he have his review displaying in another window multi tasking s grand so here goes I thought the story while not the world s most original was far more than very very weak it was considerably more literate than most these days with no real holes There were no great surprises yes love triumphs would the movie be as interesting if they ended up hating each other but plenty enough twists and turns to keep things moving I didn t see much of Gibson posturing he was merely trying to save his life And Hawn was more than cute she had a definite and reasonably strong personality of her own Sure there was plenty of action explosions car chases a really good one I thought etc why is this bad The movie is an action comedy The one point Mr Dorsett don t that sound formal made several times was the Bad Guys tm were inexplicable I didn t understand how he arrived at this opinion at all Obviously they were somewhat stereotypical granted but hey corrupt drug cops in search of revenge against the narc that did them in Gibson Fifteen years in prison would be enough to give them a pretty strong grudge The FBI agent that deleted Gibson s file and otherwise helped the bad guys trail him was being blackmailed by the two ex cops The points Robert lists in the Spoilers section of his review at the end I didn t understand any of them Who were the people the ex DEA people were doing deals with that wanted Gibson dead I didn t see them the primary bad guys were the two bad ex cops and the FBI agent they were blackmailing He made a few other points too as I said I didn t follow his logic or what he was saying At any rate I don t think there were plot holes relating to this aspect of the movie Moving back to the first part of the review on Product Endorsements I didn t see these to be big at all She was driving a blue BMW the police had to refer to it as such they couldn t just be on the lookout for a blue convertible luxury car And the Apple placement was similar although a bit more noticeable Apple emblem on the side of the machine I guess my point is so It d be tough to make a movie without tossing in a few brand names It wasn t distracting or anything In his Downer section Robert again refers to Gibson as a Sex Symbol and Hawn as a Giddy Flake Again I didn t see this Gibson is a sex symbol and again he was running for his life so I think he was excused in being a Tough Guy tm Casting against type is difficult and what s wrong with casting with type And again I didn t see Hawn s character as being a giddy flake or a rich spoiled mover and shaker Sure there were a few obligatory jokes by Hawn along those lines I need food I need a shower I need a massage when lost in the woods etc but these were nowhere near as frequent or silly as many movies with similar openings And on to the Spoilers section guess I better stick one of these things in although I guess I ve let a few slip by already As to the left at the altar grieving widow contradiction well I guess either Hawn was speaking metaphorically in one or the other s case most likely the latter At any rate a minor nit pick I ve covered the bad guy debate so about the flying scene I thought it was quite well done and I m usually on the lookout for bad special effects as I hope to make a career in that field good luck huh What particular instance does he think he saw a model I thought it was quite apparent in most parts that they were indeed using a real plane helicopter and I didn t see any obvious models And about the plane helicopter number prefixes didn t catch that and come on that is a minor slip Most people don t know about those things anyway His appraisal of the zoo scene I almost can agree with it was pretty contrived and it probably wasn t necessary to have it there However it was well done and had good tension and was a reasonably good climax I ve seen a few better and many worse The two first oddment he mentioned tiger chasing Hawn s coat instead of her well I guess maybe you have a point that was a little daft But it worked As to the second though why tigers passed up fresh meat and kept nipping at Gibson swinging there don t most wild animals prefer to hunt their meals This is why playing possum works in at least some cases The tigers were probably simply more interested in the prospect of hunting the still moving Gibson than preying on the already dead and quite still Bad Guy This also goes to suggest that yes indeed these animals were fed previously a starving tiger will eat whatever whether or not it killed it personally And wasn t the Bad Guy still lying on the electric fence The tigers had certainly learned long before to avoid that sucker Finally he says the movie seems to be intended for television virtually no profanity and surprisingly little violence Well I for one found it pretty refreshing to hear something other than four letter words every verse end As to little violence there was a considerable amount I thought granted not terribly graphic but nonetheless violence I suppose surprisingly is a relative term though It worked for me Overall then I almost fully disagree with Robert Dorsett s review of this movie I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining well laid movie with plenty of action and humor and enough romance to pass muster I don t think there were any real holes in the plot and there was enough depth to the plot to make it interesting to the thinking mind too I d give it a

0764,Bird on a Wire,1990,Reviews of this movie seem to fall into two camps either the movie is depicted as a See Mel Run and Hear Goldie Scream film Summer Camp for the Stars or the movie is seen as a nice little action comedy that only reviewers can t appreciate You know by now that Mel plays Rick and Goldie plays Marianne Rick is part of the Federal Witness Protection Program He testified against some bad guys and has been looking over his shoulder ever since Marianne is his former sort of fiance who was told that Rick died in a plane crash part of his cover She has long since given Rick up for dead but still carries a picture of him At the start of our story Marianne is headed for Detroit where Our Hero Mel oops Rick is a service station attendant So far so good Heck I m willing to accept that a person who looks like Gibson oops Rick and has an IQ over 45 and has a college education would be a grease monkey at some little station in Detroit no problem Like maybe he s not ambitious No problem And I m perfectly willing to accept the chance meeting that brings Marianne to Rick s door I mean life is funny right So the basic idea that this story is built on is okay with me At least up to there Now I don t want to wear an asbestos suit because I don t want to inhale any of those nasty asbestos fibers so I won t give away too much of the story Besides I doubt I could if my life depended on it Because you see no matter how willing you might be at the start of the movie by the time the movie starts cooking you have to be very forgiving of the uhm plot And you have to develop a tolerance for Goldie s little screams and big screams little whines and big whines And you have to forgive Goldie for playing such a snivelling fool in every movie she s made for the last ten years As for Mel well he does fine really but let s just put it this way This ain t no Hamlet role This is a chase movie There s a period there folks If you like chase movies see this one because it s snappy and has pretty people to look at and smile at Lisa somebody or other from Entertainment Tonight asked Mel to describe this movie He said and I m quoting him It s somewhere to go and sit in the dark and choke on your popcorn He s got that exactly right It s not great art and it doesn t try to be Even so I can t help but be disappointed There s nothing new in this film and no real chemistry between the players There s no TIME for chemistry it s one chase after another after another Would a little bit of character development really have gotten in the way In a related vein could Marianne have had a bit of gumption and solved problems on her own instead of playing helpless And my biggest gripe with this picture It s supposed to be a fairly light hearted romantic comedy with suspense thrown in What s light hearted about shooting the romantic lead in the abdomen and the shoulder What did they think this was LETHAL WEAPON III I guess the director and the screenwriter just couldn t resist After all Gibson is so good at playing hurt he s got the sexiest grimace in town Let s just shoot him a couple of times make him bleed all over the place and then make him okay at the end whaddya think I think they coulda done better If I play compare this movie BIRD ON A WIRE doesn t fare well If I just look at the movie as a separate entity it s a disappointment Eh I d rather go to a movie that offers something more than a place to sit and choke on my popcorn But Gibson does look cute with a ponytail
0765,Bird on a Wire,1990,Mel Gibson is Richard Jarmine a guy who testified against a couple of corrupt DEA agents and was rewarded by being placed in the Federal Witness Protection program Goldie Hawn plays a lawyer Marianne Graves who runs into Richard at a Gas Station The last time she s seen him is 15 years ago when he left her at the altar In fact when she gets gas at a station that he s working at she s not sure it s him Prior to all the above events a bad dude David Carradine one of the DEA people that Rick sent to prison has just been released and needs to wipe Rick out both on general principles and because Rick hasn t testified against the bad dude s partner another bad dude These bad dudes hunt Rick down and attempt to kill him In the meantime Marianne has gone back to the place where Rick works to see if it really is him and notices the bad dudes attempting to turn Rick into dog food Some excitement later Rick and Marianne are now together and Rick needs Marianne to help him find his contact at the FBI to relocate him but that person appears to have retired and the FBI doesn t have any record of Rick now This is because another bad FBI dude has wiped out Ricks records for reasons that never were explained The rest of the movie is guns babes Rachel Varney played by some playmate motorcycles hairdressers bad dudes and wild animals Rick and Marianne constantly leap from the frying pan and into the fire The final fire is at a zoo where Rick used to work and he uses his rapport with animals and a lot of luck to smoke all the bad dudes The number of chases crashes exciting events is quite long and fun to watch However after LETHAL WEAPON 1 2 it s very difficult to watch Mel not being a kick butt kind of guy I suppose it was an attempt to show that clever is better than brawn but I think the latter is more fun to watch In the end Rick and Marianne emerge victorious and in love and live happily ever after Rating If I was going to be picky BIRD ON A WIRE doesn t have a lot going for it The plot doesn t really develop why was the FBI guy that wiped out Ricks file involved with the other bad dudes and I m not sure why they bothered to mention that Marianne is a lawyer I don t recall hearing her spout any legalese unless the point was to show that she s rich There were other gripes and holes but it certainly wasn t the worst So it rates 2 stars average on the 1 to 4 star scale Enjoyability Rating Disregarding the above the film is pretty good I enjoyed it very much Mel s a stud Goldie s a babe and there was enough action comedy adventure that even if you noticed the holes in the plot you were too caught up in what was going on to pay much attention Make no mistake the film hauls butt I d recommend it to my friends and maybe even see it again so it gets a 3 stars out of 4 for enjoyment

0768,Brain Dead,1990,As the Phantom mentioned last week in his review of the unfortunate TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE the film so disappointed and disillusioned him that he was forced to seek solace in the arms of the Criterion Center New York s sleaziest legitimate theater Whenever he comes to believe that films and especially horror films have become too mainstream too middle of the road too tame and too well boring he checks out the Criterion conveniently located in the heart of Times Square home to more sleaze than the boards of a dozen Texas savings and loans He had quite a selection of choice films from which to choose and although several of the ninja and revenge films seemed to have much to recommend them he chose BRAIN DEAD instead because he felt it so aptly described the sad excuse for a horror film to which he had just been subjected So imagine his surprise when he found that not only was BRAIN DEAD a cut above the average horror film and at least three cuts above the cut rate TALES but that it was a superb example of the genre a little known and limited release gem in the rough of big budget and big name bungles BRAIN DEAD is good for the same reasons that TALES was not for one someone actually sat down and wrote an intelligent script For another that person was Charles Beaumont one of the original writers for the Twilight Zone series And finally BRAIN DEAD was directed with style and confidence by Adam Simon a director with whom the Phantom is not familiar but one whom he hopes will continue working in the field The last director who so impressed the Phantom was John McNaughton who brought us the incredible HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER before that the Phantom would have to go back to Sam Raimi and his equally stylish and compelling EVIL DEAD series Such directors are quite obviously few and far between Now lest the Phantom raise his phan s hopes too high let him say that while BRAIN DEAD is quite good it isn t really in the same class as either McNaughton or Raimi s masterpieces BRAIN DEAD is stylish it s fairly original it s well written but it does have problems Before we get to the problems though the Phantom will attempt a brief plot synopsis It s a dream isn t it That s about it Throughout the film it s never quite clear what is and isn t a dream Beaumont and Simon lead us on for ten or fifteen minutes at a time only to confound our expectations time and time again The protagonist appears to be involved in brain research particularly in the mapping of specific thoughts actions and personality traits to specific portions of the brain and he s called upon to help a mathematician who was hospitalized after he cracked during a particularly difficult equation and one that evidently would lead to a conclusion of unspeakable violence this is implied by the mushroom cloud drawn just to the right of the equals sign In fact the corporation for which he works has the blackboard containing the equation but they don t have the right side just the left and a paranoid schizophrenic who used to be their star researcher Of course this theme has been touched upon by countless horror films in the past most popularly in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series its roots go back to the stellar DEAD OF NIGHT in 1945 a film that predated the Twilight Zone television series by 20 years and provided the inspiration for many of its best episodes the Phantom is indebted to Brandi Weed who reminded him of this wonderful classic those phans who enjoy classic Zone episodes will be more than pleased by this very early horror effort But rarely has the theme of dream vs reality been carried quite so far and for so much of a film as it has been in BRAIN DEAD In the Phantom s eyes this is what makes BRAIN DEAD a cut above the average horror film As he mentioned in his review of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE most horror films suffer from an excess of exposition the writers and directors spend much too much time on perfectly ordinary scenes of perfectly ordinary people doing perfectly ordinary things in the hopes that these scenes will provide dramatic contrast with the horror to come Sometimes this works HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD come to mind but most often it doesn t and instead it creates the 7 minutes of tedium scenario that we ve grown to loathe but live with in the interminable FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES for every killing or suspenseful scene there is a corresponding seven minutes of pointless dialogue and exposition Where s Sally I don t know Is she in the barn Maybe she s in the basement Should we go down there and on and on ad infinitum and ad nauseam that do nothing but help us bide our time until the screenplay gets back to Jason his hockey mask and his impressive array of gardening implements But in BRAIN DEAD Beaumont and Simon have all but done away with the curse of the 7 minute space filler throughout the film even the blind alleys are interesting and we spend so much time trying to figure out whether what we re seeing is real that we barely have enough time to catch our breath and pat ourselves on the back for figuring things out before we re sent off into still another dream or as is more frequently the case another nightmare This too is one of the best things about BRAIN DEAD whereas most horror films use dreams and dream sequences and the contrast between dreams and reality in a cheap and exploitative way Beaumont and Simon do an admirable job of exploring the theme Throughout the film they avoid most of the more sensationalistic and shocking aspects of the dream within a dream sequences unlike in say AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON or CARRIE people don t suddenly wake up beside dead people or thrust their hands through the six feet of dirt covering their coffins While those kinds of thrills are fun they have to be taken in moderation if in the ELM STREET series Freddy could appear at will anywhere at any time there wouldn t be much point to having chase sequences and the films themselves would be almost wholly without suspense Instead the dreams in BRAIN DEAD go on for tens of minutes at a time and this turns out to be a much more effective and disturbing technique than the quick scares that comprise most horror films Showing decomposing corpses is easy having reality degenerate slowly but surely into the impossible landscape of a nightmare is difficult But it s also very effective and the Phantom thinks that it will be much more greatly appreciated by true phans of the genre Unfortunately in structuring a film like this they also break one of the cardinal rules of the game continuity By the time BRAIN DEAD nears its end we feel somewhat cheated because we find that there is no way to keep the story straight in our minds The Phantom wished he d saved his FIRST POWER score card there are so many false leads and blind alleys in BRAIN DEAD that he felt somewhat frustrated by the time his popcorn ran out though in truth that might have been the real reason for his frustration For some this may be what ultimately sinks the film The Phantom believes that he is better than most at suspending disbelief and accepting whatever premise with which the filmmakers wish to proceed but even he started having difficulty with BRAIN DEAD toward the end However those phans who stick it out will be amply rewarded unlike run of the mill horror films made by run of the mill directors with dreams of sequels dancing in their heads BRAIN DEAD has a real believable and satisfying ending As he unstuck his sneakers from the floor and left the theater the Phantom caught himself thinking that with the exception of the exceptionally literate HENRY it had been a long time since he had seen a film horror or otherwise that had an ending other than trap catch the bad guy zombie Russian sub commander and kill him disintegrate him repatriate him For all its faults and sometimes faulty logic BRAIN DEAD has a real and reasonable ending and that too puts it a cut above the competition So phans on the whole the Phantom highly recommends this one Alas BRAIN DEAD seems to be in very limited release so much so that he never saw a newspaper advertisement for it so phans who wish to see it will probably have to wait until it makes its Blockbusters debut That s especially a shame in this case since BRAIN DEAD boasts some stunning cinematography and clever camera work that will likely be lost on the small screen And yes that last sentence does set off even the Phantom s alliteration alert but thank you so much for noticing
0769,Class of 1999,1990,Though the Phantom usually apologizes for taking longer than a few days in getting his reviews to his phans in this case no apology is really needed since the Phantom in a departure from his usual verbose style is going to advise his phans up front to sit out Mark Lester s somewhat entertaining but rather lame sequel to his 1982 cult favorite CLASS OF 1984 or at least wait for its Blockbusters debut in a few months Now imagine that sentence had the Phantom not departed from his usual verbose style For those phans not familiar with Lester s earlier work CLASS OF 1984 was intended to be an updating of the schoolroom chaos classic THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE The idea was much the same a naive teacher comes to a troubled inner city school and is forced to contend with a gang of thugs who do everything they can to discourage him from teaching Sadly BLACKBOARD JUNGLE seems fairly tame and dated by our contemporary standards and it is no doubt for this reason that Lester went to great lengths to make things in CLASS OF 1984 just a little more outrageous than the reality of even the most troubled school Yes many city schools now force students to submit to metal detectors but at least there aren t many yet where teachers are threatened with axes or where students are pushed into buzz saws or where teachers go berserk and teach their biology classes at gunpoint At least not yet though had someone suggested the possibility of teaching at gunpoint to a certain frustrated high school chemistry teacher the Phantom remembers chances are the teacher would at least have raised the possibility with the school board and teachers union CLASS OF 1984 wasn t a great film but it was a lot of fun One reason for its success is the shear obviousness of its plot It s something so familiar and comfortable to us we know just how the entire film will progress we know that there won t be any unpleasant and surprising plot twists and we know that if we decide to watch our microwave popcorn for the whole four minutes we really won t miss that much We ve seen it all before but while obviousness is a serious drawback in other genres it is sometimes a distinct plus when it comes to horror films Why else do we so eagerly await each of Freddy Michael and Jason s new installments Of course we know that the teacher will win out in the end and of course we know that all those awful students will get just what they deserve before the credits roll To be fair Timothy Van Patten also had a lot to do with CLASS OF 1984 s success his over the top performance as a combination sociopath and accomplished but frustrated pianist added a spark of life and more than a little camp to what otherwise might have been an ordinary run of the mill revenge film And seeing Michael I haven t added the J yet Fox play a frightened freshmen is alone worth the price of admission his incredibly melodramatic performance in this cheap exploitation flick is likely to be a little further back to the future than he would care to remember at this point in his career Lester s latest CLASS OF 1999 isn t exactly a sequel since all the bad guys get theirs at the end of CLASS OF 1984 instead it s more like a spinoff And in this season of high concept horror films CLASS OF 1999 is no exception The high concept pitch OK imagine ROBOCOP meets THE TERMINATOR but with teachers not cops Things get so bad in the schools they have to hire androids to teach but they lose control of them and The Phantom was disappointed that the print ads didn t feature an original slogan like Meet the future of classroom instruction though perhaps the fear of litigation stifled the producers creative impulses But like many high concept films CLASS OF 1999 suffers from a distinct lack focus It starts in the same vein as ROBOCOP complete with a bleak vision of the future a future where most schools are declared free fire zones students are asked to check their automatic weapons at the door to be picked up after school ends and the government agency charged with educating our nation s youth is the Department of Educational Defense The joke here is that the students have made it so difficult for average teachers i e human teachers to teach that the Department and the school board of a beleaguered Seattle school resort to extreme measures they decide to try using experimental androids to teach classes and restore order in the school Since the androids look human enough well human enough to pass for teachers anyway the students don t realize what s happening until it s too late Had Lester stuck with this theme as Paul Verhoeven did with ROBOCOP he might have had something here alas Lester is no Verhoeven Instead he chickens out and turns CLASS OF 1999 into a TERMINATOR clone about half way through Unfortunately although both ROBOCOP and THE TERMINATOR deal with future technology and specifically with androids and how they interact with people they re fundamentally different films It would have made no sense for Peter Weller to suddenly lose his mind and start killing innocent people just as it would have made no sense for Schwarzenegger had to look that one up phans the Phantom can never remember how many Z s go on the marquee to fall in love to their credit neither Verhoeven nor Cameron stray from the single point of focus in their respective films that s what makes them great directors Lester however is basically a hack and he makes the mistake of assuming that if one idea is good then two are even better the Phantom hereby dubs this THE FIRST POWER syndrome in honor of one of the silliest and most overplotted horror films in recent memory There was an echo of CLASS OF 1999 in CLASS OF 1984 when toward the end Malcolm McDowell who played a burnt out and hard drinking biology teacher finally cracks after Timothy Van Patten and pals kill his laboratory animals and specifically put his favorite lab rabbit on a rotisserie FATAL ATTRACTION style McDowell is found holding a gun on his biology class forcing them to learn or die Without a doubt there is something undeniably funny about a biology teacher holding a 32 to a student s head and asking her how many chambers the human heart has Come on now you know this It s very important that you try to remember But instead of expanding on this idea furthering the already outrageous joke by making the teachers inhuman robots Lester decides to go the TERMINATOR route and turn CLASS OF 1999 into a bad remake of that hunt and destroy classic The teachers you see are really army surplus and the unscrupulous head of MegaTech played by Stacy Keach with a white mane of hair and Star Trek style contacts in his eyes knows that with a little reprogramming he can pass them off as fully certified classroom instruction units But Keach has a hidden agenda he knows that once the teachers get a taste of corporal punishment they ll begin to revert back to their original purpose and he finally be able to prove to the army how effective they are in combat That s really much too much story for such a simple minded film and though there are dozens of great scenes and lots of great ideas scattered through CLASS OF 1999 just can t support all that plot Instead it winds up as another candidate for our ever expanding half film festival Lester would have been better advised to stick to the successful formula of CLASS OF 1984 the kind of formula that makes Troma films like the TOXIC AVENGER series so enjoyable rather than try to take a stab at creating a fully realized future world that s part ROAD WARRIOR part ROBOCOP part TERMINATOR but only partly successful Still how can you not enjoy seeing an android teacher approach an unruly student and go through a menu of possible responses in his heads up display 1 educate 2 reprimand 3 discipline And how can you help but enjoy the little throwaway touches throughout the film like the Orwellian electronic signs in the school urging the students to LEARN and OBEY And to the film s credit the creature and robot effects are quite good at least as good as the effects in the similarly budgeted TERMINATOR But in the end all the individual parts just don t add up to one coherent whole Every time we think that Lester has finally found his voice he pulls the rug out from under us and changes the tone of the film once again usually for the worse By the film s end we re just biding our time until the teachers can all be exterminated by the rival gangs of students who have in a wonderful moment of classic film cliche shook hands and joined to fight their common enemy And we do this only because Lester holds out the promise of a TERMINATOR style ending one promise that he does in fact deliver on With ROBOCOP 2 and TOTAL RECALL arriving in the theaters shortly there s not much point in seeing CLASS OF 1999 in just a few weeks it ll all be done better with better special effects with higher budgets and with tee shirts and Burger King glasses galore But CLASS OF 1999 is worth seeing once the hoopla of the summer s releases fade and fall is once again upon us On the bright side remember that it did take Lester eight years to bring forth this sub par sequel to his cultish CLASS OF 1984 if he keeps to this pace the Phantom won t have to review CLASS OF 2001 complete with gorillas space stations and a tall black chalkboard that hums for a good long time

0771,Fire Birds,1990,The previews of FIRE BIRDS make it out to be another TOP GUN when I first saw them my reaction was is that legal The plots seemed to be almost identical Well I was wrong the plots are slightly different and TOP GUN is the better movie I kid you not FIRE BIRDS is a confused or in the words of one patron in the audience stupid movie that pitches AH 64 Apaches against the Villain of the Week the drug cartel Its central characters are two rather egocentric immature men one a pilot played by Nicholas Cage the other his instructor played by Tommy Lee Jones No kids Sean Young doesn t play a terribly noteworthy role except perhaps to give women someone to identify with I am starting to understand the bean counters in Hollywood and strongly suspect this to be the case All three pilots are Good Damned Good The Best You know the type The story let s see if I got this right has a group of Apache pilots being trained to provide air support for a Gesta uh DEA raid against some kind of summit conference of Drug Lords Cage plays the young bronco Young the love interest Besides personality problems Cage has a problem flying with a night vision gizmo which turns out to be utterly irrelevant and develops a competition of wits with his instructor who has just turned 40 The two bright spots in the movie are the character of Jones as well as his performance and the nice photography Unlike TOP GUN the dogfights in this movie can actually be followed If one ignores the absurdity of pushing the old Apache or any helicopter as a fighter the movie got extensive support from the Army and McDonnell Douglas so its PR aspect is undoubtedly well considered most of the combat sequences are pretty fun Problem is though one has to wade through some of the stupidest corniest dialog of all time in order to get to the good parts For this reason I give this movie a 6 10 rating In terms of letter grades here s how it stocks against the other Summer Blockbusters so far CADILLAC MAN C FIRE BIRDS C BIRD ON A WIRE D Some may question my assigning letter grades to these flicks but this is a competition to see who makes the most money and grades are a commonly used means assigning relative standards of mediocrity Not even the shallowest movie goer can call these Works of Art Although some have tried their best a few on this very newsgroup
0773,Longtime Companion,1990,Capsule review The tragic effect of AIDS on the gay community is movingly brought to the screen This American Playhouse production may be the most adult and substantial film released this summer albeit one of the least expensive Rating high 1 Some of the best films being shown in theaters are actually made for television They are productions for PBS s American Playhouse that get their initial release in movie theaters before getting shown on public television It is a positive sum strategy since a theatrical release will help pay for the film Since the film is already made for another venue the investment to get it into the theaters is relatively meager And it is nice to see a film a little more substantial than BACK TO THE FUTURE III or FIRE BIRDS playing on the wide screen Norman Rene directed Craig Lucas s screenplay The subject is a group of gay friends living on Fire Island and in Manhattan and how AIDS changed their lives They go from an apparently carefree existence in the early Eighties through somber and often frightening changes as the disease claims victims from among their numbers The behaviors we see are very much universal to epidemics and plagues Initially the diseases are taken with concern but also with an occasional flippant optimism We see weird explanations of what the epidemic really is Paranoia poisons the former carefree friendships All the while the disease is taking its toll in the decreasing circle of friends LONGTIME COMPANION has too many major characters to keep them all straight no pun intended particularly because they all look like wholesome male WASPs but the center of the group is David played by Bruce Davison Davison s acting goes unnoticed until his character is placed under a severe emotional strain Then Davison does some excellent acting that must be about the best he has ever done Also notable is Mary Louise Parker as a close heterosexual friend A couple of touches in the script are worth mentioning There is a reference in the 1982 sequence to William Hurt playing a gay character I believe they are alluding to Hurt s performance in the 1985 KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN Also there are about ten dated sequences and all but the last four take place on Fridays That seems too many for coincidence yet none of the last four is a Friday I am probably the only one who notices these things LONGTIME COMPANION is not great I would give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale But at a reported 1 5 million in production cost and with a timely subject this film is probably a very good choice for a theatrical release
0774,Total Recall,1990,Arnold Swarzenegger stars as a rather mixed up guy in the somewhat distant future The movie begins with him having a deep hankering to go to Mars His wife isn t keen on the idea so he settles for something second best to have the memories of a trip to Mars implanted in his brain He chooses the company s Secret Agent option the next thing we see is that the procedure goes wrong he starts playing the secret agent after getting doped up but before the new memories have been implanted The rest of the film is more or less an action adventure with a few plot twists is it all a hallucination or isn t it to spice things up As a science fiction movie all I can say is that I m reminded of the old actor s adage about Star Trek it doesn t matter how preposterous the story is you ve just got to believe in it The cast here by and large does their best to make the movie fly The story though let s face it is preposterous I was willing to buy the memory bit but the physics in the rest of the film yuck and leans less on science fiction than on pure fantasy The whole thing comes across like a 50 s 60 s era sci fi flick with many things not quite clicking into place Even Swarzenegger s trademark humor is intentionally somewhat sterile although there are some bright moments The flick sort of reminded me of Sean Connery s OUTLAND which was a far better movie and made far better use of the cramped mining town oppressive environment gimmick Swarzenegger s last SF film PREDATOR was a lot slicker This one however tries to be a combination of both with a bit of ROBOCOP which I didn t care for and COMMANDO thrown in for good measure There are product placements everywhere Evian Hilton Heinz Jack in the Box USA Today and hundreds of others which I didn t catch They are all listed at the end of the film These are used generally to provide texture but abnormally tilted labels always pisses me off I ve yet to see a kitchen in which all the shelves are piled up on the counter with every single label pointed straight at you If one were cynical one would find some pleasure in seeing these companies portrayed in the way they were Jack in the Box for instance is located next door to a whorehouse Mars Today is the organ of a demagogue the Hilton s the site of several shoot outs and terrorist incidents And I did Rating 6 10 or a B on the Summer Grading Scheme
0775,Total Recall,1990,Capsule review Violence chases thoughtful plotting special effects gore Arnold Schwarzenegger a few intelligent ideas They don t all seem as if they could be in one film Nobody will be totally happy with TOTAL RECALL but there is a surprising degree of good science fiction in what could be Arnold Schwarzenegger s most intelligent fantasy film to date Rating 2 I have to say that I usually am not very impressed by action or violence in films How much variation is there in chase scenes from one film to the next To my mind there is almost none other than the background scenery changing The same goes for violence There are about as many ways to tear apart a human as there are to carve a turkey It is a special effect that has been done so many times in film that it no longer is of any interest to me to see it I am well aware that there are people who can enjoy chases and violence in film after film and enjoy them every time just as there are people who listen to the Top 40 radio stations and can enjoy hearing the same songs over and over Chase scenes and violence to me seem like unimaginative filler In addition and amazingly I find I have this weird psychic ability to know at the beginning of a fight scene who is going to win the fight If there are four armed thugs taking on an unarmed Arnold Schwarzenegger psychic vibrations tell me at the beginning of the fight who is going to win The vibrations work for chase scenes also and there too they remove much of the suspense There have been a number of films that have tried to marry action to a science fiction plot They have been films such as THE TERMINATOR PREDATOR THEY LIVE and ROBOCOP I consistently like them less than the general public does and it is more than likely because the action and violence scenes have so little value for me What I think I am really rating is the science fiction film that frames the action and violence often making for a much shorter film Take the action and violence from the four films I mentioned and none is a particularly good science fiction film Only THEY LIVE has a particularly engaging premise That may be because THEY LIVE is an adaptation of a pre existing published science fiction story so to some extent the story has stood on its own TOTAL RECALL is a new action film also based on an existing science fiction story and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger An Arnold Schwarzenegger action film based on a story by Philip K Dick sounds almost like a contradiction in terms Dick writes cerebral not to say neurotic science fiction about people who generally seem to live inside their heads You could not fit Schwarzenegger into a Dick story with a crowbar The main character of Dick s We Can Remember It for You Wholesale is a mousy hen pecked government clerk Changes were inevitable if the story was to be made into an action vehicle and vast changes were indeed made Yet the screenplay has retained much of the plot and most of the engaging ideas of the story before going off in its own direction Even when it does diverge some of the concepts it adds are thoughtful and intelligent Of course some unfortunately are not I know of nobody who actually liked the last ten minutes or so of the film Like many films TOTAL RECALL was damaged by somebody s idea of a big finish This is a story with a lot of twists particularly early on when it is still being faithful to the original story This means that I cannot be very informative about the plot but I can say that it starts out being about a sort of an average 21st century man with big muscles and an unusual problem He keeps dreaming about Mars There is nothing in life Doug Quaid wants more than to go to Mars In the story his name was Doug Quail but it was changed possibly because it sounded too much like Dan Quayle Unfortunately only relatively few people can go to the mining colonies on Mars and Quaid is not one Well the next best thing to being there is having been there The difference between having been there and not is having the memories In this future world a company called REKALL can put artificial memories into your head more vivid and believable than real memories So Quaid agrees to buy an artificial memory of Mars just a minor adjustment to his reality But any Philip K Dick fan can tell you things go awry when you start adjusting reality They certainly do for Quaid The script is a remarkable piece of work that allows the viewer to look at the altering of reality to be a minor plot complication in an action film or it could be what the film is all about My wife came up with reasonable internal evidence that the surface interpretation of what happens in the film is wrong and another interpretation of the reality is correct Clearly the script is richer than one usually expects from a Schwarzenegger action chase film Visually there are some very unconvincing effects and some very nice ones Some of the model work is below average for Industrial Light Magic and Dream Quest but there are some very impressive sights also Audiences seem to enjoy the subway security station as an effect different from what ILM and DQ have done in the past the special effects have been described as eye popping a pun that will be appreciated in the first five minutes of the film but also an accurate one That brings us to the gore This film is directed by Dutchman Paul Verhoeven He is generally good but uses a very great deal of gore and violence particularly in his later films This is a very violent film and viewers should go expecting that Also go expecting to see a lot of familiar brand names that helped to finance the film Of course Dick mentions a typewriter company by name in the original story so there are precedents In summary TOTAL RECALL is a lot of different films It should please pretty much anyone who likes science fiction films It should have a broad range of appeal on many levels I rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale The novelette We Can Remember It for You Wholesale can be found in the following magazines collections and anthologies MAGAZINE OF FANTASY SCIENCE FICTION April 1966 MAGAZINE OF FANTASY SCIENCE FICTION 30th Anniversary

0776,Vreme na nasile,1988,This is another review from the rapidly receding AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival The film in question is probably not playing at your local theaters nor is it likely to any time soon Most Americans are extremely parochial in their film viewing habits British films are unusual to them French films exotic and Japanese films the furthest they might stretch if that far A whole world of cinema exists outside the attention of American viewers a world filled with worthwhile and often brilliant films When the films in question require tremendous stretching of the viewers expectations of what a film is a certain laziness is understandable Lots of people go to movies strictly for low thought entertainment and they should not be expected to endure LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD or the latest enigma from Godard But there is still a body of fine entertaining film hidden away only because of language and cultural barriers Americans will not read subtitles for the most part and don t care to learn about any other nation s history or culture They barely care about their own nation s as the relative failure of GLORY demonstrated This parochialism is particularly evident when one sees a film like TIME OF VIOLENCE A Bulgarian film TIME OF VIOLENCE uses precisely the same stylistic conventions as American films the same form of storytelling the same approach to character the same values as to what makes a good story and moreover it satisfies American criteria for being a good movie There is a basic story with well attached subplots lots of action villains and heros with a bit more complexity perhaps than most American films and a logical resolution The production values are high the performances excellent the direction skillful The film has done very well in many countries including some as foreign to Bulgarian culture as Japan So why can t the filmmakers get any distribution deal in the U S TIME OF VIOLENCE suffers only from its language and its setting Few Americans know much about the Balkans during the 17th Century But it was one of those proverbial interesting times during which it was a curse to live Most of the Balkans were under the thumb of the Ottoman empire Islamic empires have more of a reputation for tolerance than most but the Ottoman empire was showing its ugliest face during this period in Bulgaria Bulgaria was a strategically important area inhabited by unreliable Christian subjects The sultan decided that they must all convert to Islam or die TIME OF VIOLENCE focuses on the fate of one valley during this crisis The son of the miller was taken off by the Turks years ago while still a boy to become a janissary Janissaries were special troops used by the Ottomans Recruited involuntarily from Christian boys they were separated from their families at an early age indoctrinated in Islam and turned into fiercely reliable troops with no allegiance to anyone but the sultan The miller s son is now a highly trusted janissary with the task of converting his entire home valley to Islam But the people there take their religion very seriously and will not submit The janissary becomes more and more brutal in his attempts to convert the valley for he must slaughter them all if they don t take the turban The film is painted on a large sweeping canvas with many characters and subplots all cleverly woven into a single story This accomplishment is even more remarkable when you consider that the original Bulgarian version was nearly two hours longer yet there is no sign at all that anything has been cut And surprisingly this isn t a vile Turk story Director Ludmil Staikov has much more ambitious goals including an examination of the power of religion and of the destructiveness of violence and fanaticism Not all of the Christians are good nor all of the Muslims bad The Turkish governor of the valley is not loved by his subjects yet does all he can to avert their doom He is given a beautiful tender moment as he leaves the valley forever in disgrace Crossing a bridge that leads out of his valley he notices a stone that has worked out of place He gets down from his horse carefully puts the stone back into its place and then proceeds on to his exile Even the janissary has his complexities as he truly wants to spare his people from unnecessary pain despite having completely transferred his loyalties to the sultan The screenplay by Staikov Georgi Danailov Mihail Kirkov and Radoslav Spassov provides complex shadings of characters and motivations TIME OF VIOLENCE is a professionally made film beautifully photographed well edited and with scrupulous care in costuming and set design The period atmosphere feels perfectly authentic at least to someone with only passing familiarity with the time and place The technical aspects of the film are well up to the standard of moderate budget Hollywood movies There are some unpleasant moments of torture and brutality in TIME OF VIOLENCE but they do not exist to excite or titillate Rather they are necessary to demonstrate the full scope of the tragedy Still some viewers may find themselves looking away during certain scenes But otherwise TIME OF VIOLENCE is a film without flaws There are no particularly weak points in the film and many great virtues The problem with TIME OF VIOLENCE is really just that most Americans will never get the chance to see it and even if they had the chance most Americans wouldn t take it Dubbing the film might give it a slightly wider audience but even then it would be unlikely to draw too many people If MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON a pretty good English language African adventure film can t bring in the audiences how can a film about a small country s historical woes At any rate if you do get a chance to see it I recommend TIME OF VIOLENCE highly
0777,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,1990,GREMLINS 2 is a hard film to pin down and review It is hard to criticize the story because it s not seriously trying to tell its story Maybe it is working only half time to tell its story and the other half is divided up among making film references making comments about business and politics and playing practical jokes on the viewer As rationales for sequels go this one is about par for being crass and high concept The little monsters are back and taking over Trump Tower Of course they cannot call it Trump Tower so it is Clamp Center owned by Daniel Clamp an amalgam of Donald Trump and Ted Turner The world needed a film with the gremlins vandalizing a skyscraper about as much as it needed a toothbrush with disk brakes But while it seemed in GREMLINS that the gags were getting in the way of the story telling in GREMLINS 2 the story does a much better job of staying out of the way of the gags Just as the gremlins take over the building the gags take over the film That is fine I suppose because while I cannot recommend the story I did appreciate many of the gags I rather hope that this film is marketed on videocassette with a complete list of the films parodied and the well known people appearing during the course of GREMLINS 2 Then the movie can be played like a word search puzzle The plot has likable young couple Billy Peltzer played by Zack Gilligan and Kate Beringer played by Phoebe Cates living together in sin in New York and both working for Clamp played by John Glover All three work in the same building with a team of genetic scientists led by Dr Catheter played by Christopher Lee Billy finds out that the genetic scientists are playing around with his favorite Gremlin and we are off Rounding out the cast we have Robert Prosky playing Al Lewis playing Grandpa playing havoc with Clamp s cable broadcast station Having Prosky playing Al Lewis is like having Robert Duvall play Soupy Sales The whole concept of the Gremlins films is that nasty accidents happen But just to show that happy accidents happen also at least for Dante GREMLINS has the Trump character discovering he likes a young woman working for him Her name is Marla Director Joe Dante insists that all filming was complete well before anyone ever heard of Marla Maples but of course the choice of that name fits very nicely with the theme of promising contrivances going wrong Of course much of the film is spent in little plays and blackout sketches that parody society and that star the very recently created Gremlin Repertory Troup They act out scenes from films that logic tells you the creatures could have no way of knowing about This apparently bothers nobody in the audience It is supposed to be funny not make sense Actually somewhat funnier are the jabs at Ted Turner and his attitude toward classic film including a great line about CASABLANCA However because I am still hung up on films having plots and this one is a pretty mediocre plot I can give this film no better than a high zero on the 4 to 4 scale
0778,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,1990,I fell asleep during TURTLES was mildly amused by BTTF III but had a terrific time at GREMLINS 2 today Yes it s true the performances by the special effects are generally better than the performances by the actors and the film has more rubber logic than most but it s FUN Yes you can guess the story Gizmo winds up in a research lab after his owner the old Chinese man dies The research lab in in Clamp Tower a massive New York sky scraper that contains various cable networks including things like The Archery Network and The Safety Channel a mall restaurants and the headquarters for Clamp International Of course Billy and Kate the heros from the first film also happen to work in that building Billy rescues Gizmo from the genetics lab run gleefully by Christopher Lee but your typical series of catastrophes happen to little Gizmo and gremlins rapidly infest the entire building Since there s a genetics lab to trash the gremlins mutate into a variety of bizarre creatures including a winged gargoyle spider monster and a quasi intellectual pipe smoking Yuppie There are more sight gags parodies and wonderful bits throughout this movie There s the Movie Police Microwaving with Marge and some amusing cameos by various Warner Brothers characters There s an on target parody of Kate s Why I Hate Christmas speech though it was a tad too long from the first movie and great satire of corporate personality throughout the film The movie is rated PG 13 though most of the violence happens to gremlins and to the set rather than to any humans Our nine year old was liked the movie but didn t really start laughing at it until after the gremlins popped out all over The puppetry and radio controlled gremlins in this movie were both extremely well done The gremlins have a little more personality in this film than in the first one GREMLINS 2 took a good idea and made it better I hope Dante company quit while they are ahead I m not sure how the movie is doing We saw it in an empty theater today which is a shame because the movie is a blast
0779,Cadillac Man,1990,CADILLAC MAN opens with shots of a cemetery An unlikely place to begin a movie about cars until we focus on the procession stalled by a broken hearse Not only does Robin Williams the consummate salesman pitch the undertaker he also hits on the widow Despite this sell at all costs attitude or perhaps because of it Williams doesn t move the cars as fast as he once did His problems pile on quickly He can t resist the ladies juggling three of them as the film starts To help meet his expenses he owes massive debts to some not so savory sources And then he receives an ultimatum Williams will lose his job unless he can sell twelve cars in two days That sets up a tidy plot Robin Williams does DEATH OF A SALESMAN But just as you think you ve got the movie straightened out it throws you a curve Tim Robbins BULL DURHAM takes the dealership hostage You see his wife is having an affair with someone in the office and he wants to know who Only Williams practiced patter can free them I found this movie the funniest I ve seen all year It doesn t reflect as sharp a vision as other black comedies but it also isn t as cruel Generally the minor characters portrayed broad stereotypes However strong acting took them past the familiar territory Both of Williams girlfriends had strong personalities although his ex wife seemed rather bland Likewise the other salesmen seemed to blend together although the customers all sharply define themselves Tim Robbins basically reprises his role of befuddled innocent from BULL DURHAM All he wants to know was Who did Donna As his plot falls apart his frustration is evident He honestly never expected police to show up When they request his demands he only wants them to go away Despite the situation you soon sympathize with him Robin Williams is quite credible as the sleazy salesman He knows the reputation and lives up to it Williams narrates the bridges and slower scenes the camera an invisible passenger in his car I found this technique distracting at times although his points were often valid Robin Williams has definitely graduated from the pack of Seventies comics While much of the SNL SCTV crowd has stagnated he takes us from laughs to near tears in seconds If future movies continue in the vein of CADILLAC MAN and DEAD POETS SOCIETY I can see Robin Williams winning an Oscar within the next decade The language seemed unnecessarily strong but didn t detract too much from the story Otherwise it was a marvelous film The soundtrack consisted of older tunes In some ways this added to the image of Robin Williams as a dying breed Although I enjoy most movies I m offering unequivocal praise here See this film and do so soon I m afraid that the summer blockbusters will roll CADILLAC MAN right out of the theaters But that s a shame because this definitely deserves a test drive

0781,Total Recall,1990,Summary Sometime in the future Douglas Quaid finds out that he s not who he remembers himself to be From there the plot takes a downturn into aliens violence Mars violence air on Mars violence and memory implants Up until now I ve always liked Schwarzenegger movies They re usually not too intellectual have lots of action lots of violence babes guns chases muscles and all the other good things that make an action film an action film Until now While TOTAL RECALL had lots of violence the special effects got in the way of what could have been a good movie It doesn t bother me to watch people get hung shot karate chopped or what have you but gallons of blood spraying everywhere tend to be distracting rather than entertaining I know I m not squeamish about blood having worked for a fire department and an ambulance company but slow mo of globules of blood flying through the air just doesn t do it for me The plot of TOTAL RECALL is okay right up to where Schwarzenegger gets to Mars The plot s complicated I m not going to attempt to explain it The memory implantation stuff reminded me of the many and various SF books that deal with sensies or feelies Movies things that allow you to sense what the characters on the screen sense Some poor special effects of people in a vacuum outright ridiculousness of the ending and the lack of believability in the story line in general ruined it Enjoyability Bleeech When I go to a movie I like to immerse myself in what s happening on the screen Movies like STAR WARS and friends I can believe because it s way beyond where we re at but is nice to think about TOTAL RECALL on the other hand was hard to believe in Aliens build air producing reactor that creates a perfectly breathable atmosphere in every detail for the human life form on a planet wide scale in a matter of seconds by converting old fashioned ice at the core of planet into life giving oxygen This air producing reactor hasn t been tested and the switch to turn it on is a large ball that you put your hand into Film at 11 Naaaah 1 star out of 4
0782,Back to the Future Part III,1990,Marty and Doc do their level best to make the Universe safe for non time travelers All the old characters including Biff are back in new roles along with the old ones I really liked this movie Almost as much as I liked part one Sure Marty and Doc don t resolve all the paradoxes that occurred might have occurred from the jumping about through the space time continuum but they have a lot of fun doing it and so did I Doc is at his zaniest best from the gigantic ice tea making machine to the telescope strapped to his rifle And of course to make it complicated Doc s gotta meet a girl Mary Steenburgen another fave Mad Dog Biff is truly the epitome of the old west sleazoids However there was one oddity about Mad Dog Doc and Marty are looking through a history book and discover that one of the reasons Mad Dog has his name is because of his tendency to drool Gallons of slobber dripping off of Mad Dog s chin in the first meeting with Marty must ve been left on the cutting room floor so Mad Dog s name really didn t make sense But if that s the only thing I can find to complain about the movie can t be too shabby The ending is certainly corny but fun It certainly looks like this is the end of the series and not much of a chance for any more Of course this was a given anyway Rating The movie s light moderately fast paced and very enjoyable It helps to riffle through BTTF II before seeing III just to refresh the old brain cells as the plot still has its twists and turns The special effects are as good as always and I almost fell out of my seat at the time traveling steam engine I give it 4 stars excellent out of 4 Enjoyability All the above Don t miss it it s great fun 4 stars again
0783,Q & A,1990,Violence and sex ratings Not an excessively violent film No sex The setting for our drama is New York City and our main characters are Al Francis Riley the assistant D A played by Timothy Hutton Quinn the district attorney played by Patrick O Neal Mike Brennan the cop who commits murder played by Nick Nolte Bobby Tex the drug dealer played by Armand Assante In most films Nick Nolte plays a gruff voiced but huggable teddy bear Not so here His character is a law and order cop whose 20 plus years on the force have pushed his hatred of low life dealers and criminals to an obsession He s the local hero of the precinct known as the cop who always delivers no matter what the difficulties When he fatally shoots a two bit criminal no one is much interested in finding out about the details The D A Quinn calls on a young cop turned lawyer Riley to run through the Q A Questions and Answers procedure This procedure is a standard call em in and ask em questions routine The outcome of a Q A is a report with recommendations that is turned over to the grand jury which then decides whether to press charges in the case The D A tells Riley that he wants an assistant D A who shares his values of law and order Riley s father was a well known cop of the same repute as Brennan and the D A seems to be grooming Riley for a part in the intricate world of enforcement The case that the D A puts him on is the shooting that began the movie This is supposedly an open and shut case of self defense and the D A tells Riley to process the case ASAP so that Brennan can get back to work One of the witnesses is Bobby Tex In the course of the investigation Riley begins to doubt Brennan s testimony but each of the witnesses whose story conflicts with Brennan s is a convicted criminal whose word means little when in direct opposition to a respected officer s word Riley is faced with the dilemma of doing his job right in other words not being a rubber stamp but by doing the job right losing the respect and backing of the D A losing the camaraderie of the cops he so hungrily wants to be part of and somehow failing in comparison with his father The people Riley always looked up look different up close and he finds his heroes even his father to be substantially lacking in the moral department Even more unsettling some of the bad guys are better than the good guys Bobby Tex is a proud Puerto Rican whose sense of honor prevents him from falsely testifying Yes he s a coke dealer but he s not the sweet Mel type of dealer that we encountered in Tequila Sunrise Bobby has a depth of character and toughness that are nearly palpable The contrast between Bobby and Riley is notable beside Bobby Riley is a wimp and a fairly dumb one at that I won t comment on the rest of the plot because information about the outcome would spoil your enjoyment of this film Instead let s probe those characters a bit Bobby Tex is the most interesting character of the film and Armand Assante turns in a great performance It s hard to believe that this is acting Assante is so perfect for this part that it seems like type casting However this street wise tough guy is played by the same actor who played the French psychiatrist in Private Benjamin Now that s scope The D A is a power hungry politician and I m a bit tired of this stereotype Nothing terribly new here and a mediocre performance by O Neal Riley could have been an excellent role for a good actor but Timothy Hutton doesn t have what it takes to suggest complexity in this character Hutton takes a very one dimensional straightforward approach here projecting naivete and a childlike trusting quality that are out of place in this film He s supposed to have been a street cop before he became a lawyer and his father was a cop too That isn t exactly the sort of background that produces naivete and childlike trust What happens to his character in this film is the stuff that great roles are made of but Hutton is simply well too simple to portray a multi dimensional character In direct contrast with Hutton is Nolte The easy Hollywood interpretation of this role would be of a hard ass racist who has complete disrespect for the law he supposedly enforces Nolte though plays a passionate man whose respect for his fellow officers and workers is completely colorblind The easy banter between the officers demonstrates an ethnic rich humor that has nothing to do with racism Interestingly the script was probably somewhat ambivalent about his orientation Nolte picked his way carefully and he crafted a tragic character of memorable proportion This is not a great film but it s a good one Its most conspicuous flaw is that some of the characters motivations are poorly sketched or played and their actions unlikely In spite of its flaws though the movie is well worth seeing just for Nolte and Assante One superior performance in a film is a rarity today Two superior performances Enjoy
0784,Dick Tracy,1990,DICK TRACY has had more hype than any other film this summer Unfortunately it doesn t live up to it When out of a stellar cast Madonna has the strongest character you know there s something wrong I d say the plot suffers from comic book simplicity but that insults comic books Big Boy Caprice has organized all the mobsters under his leadership This coalition faces trouble from Dick Tracy on the side of the law and the mysterious Blank from the criminal front That s the whole plot Dick Tracy s toughest decision is choosing between Tess Trueheart and Breathless Mahoney Madonna He waffles through the entire movie and only chooses by default The other main subplot features the now obligatory smart aleck kid Tracy continually muddles into hopeless situations which the Kid that s his name honest gets him out of Short Round in TEMPLE OF DOOM did it far better DICK TRACY easily lends itself to comparison with BATMAN Yes both come from comics but the parallels go much farther Danny Elfman scored both and he used similar music Some scenes directly correspond When he leaps through the skylight jacket flapping you cannot think of anything else One possible reason DICK TRACY felt so much weaker than Batman is the difference in their original medium Comic books can offer much more characterization than daily strips That should give the cast much more room to develop Instead it constrains them Warren Beatty both directed and starred Perhaps he should have left one of the jobs to someone else I could not care about Tracy Watching his woman problems I thought Beatty was playing himself For all the hype of the Madonna Warren Beatty romance it never showed on screen He had no chemistry with either woman Tracy wasn t even a good cop Anyone who needs a child to pull his fat out of the fire more than once obviously has problems He also admitted using unethical tactics in his investigations While Beatty stumbled along Madonna oozed sensuality When she walked on in a transparent top I couldn t believe I was watching Disney She had the best lines as well Her songs were fun although I would have liked to hear them straight through But despite the strong character Madonna also just played herself Tess Trueheart barely competes She whined her way through the entire movie What brains she had she loses midway through the film Although she accepted his desire to work the streets and knew he loved her she walks out on him with no reason Of course with a name like Trueheart you know she ll return What about the other big name stars I see no sense in hiring great actors and then covering them in makeup until they re unrecognizable Al Pacino does the best Mel Brooks imitation I have ever heard In fact with all that makeup I thought Brooks did play the role Dustin Hoffman s Mumbles does just that Some considered it self parody I just found it annoying Mandy Patinkin held a lot of promise His duet with Madonna left me wanting more But 88 Keys is a far cry from Inigo Montoya Yes the cinematography was nice I liked the color scheme and comic bookishness Beatty did a good job of recreating the forties feel especially in the montages during the music But the effects were sloppy and seriously detracted I could actually see the cut between Tess s house and the model And again I found fault with the blue screen A few other notes of interest Stephen Sondheim wrote all Madonna s music When will we get another musical from him The Batman tradition continues Disney will release three albums from the film Madonna s featuring both Sondheim s songs and her own Danny Elfman s score and the incidental music In the continuing Star Trek actor watch keep an eye peeled for Colm Meaney Lt O Brien as a police officer As an added treat the movie opens with a new Roger Rabbit cartoon I hope other studios follow Disney s lead Unfortunately Rollercoaster Rabbit shared the same plot as every other Maroon short Roger watches over Baby Herman this time at an amusement park and gets killed many times over protecting him Although some scenes particularly with the bull are funny I don t find constant injury amusing Surely Disney can do better than this
0785,Dick Tracy,1990,Who s Dick Tracy I don t know About the only thing I know about Dick is he has a radio wristwatch and doesn t he have a secret decoder ring Or is that Captain Crunch Anyway I didn t have a lot of preconceived notions about Dick Tracy when I went to see it I d seen the previews and they looked OK but there wasn t the same level of anticipation as for BATMAN Maybe Dick s a character for another generation He s certainly not a big part of mine I was definitely impressed with the show Warren Beatty plays a great Dick Tracy right down to the yellow overcoat and hat Madonna turned in what has got to be one of the best performances of her film career The woman radiated sex I was certainly surprised to see her in the ending My guess as to the real identity of No Face was way out in left field Justifiable but not on the mark Al Pacino was superb as the gangster Big Boy Caprice His constant little quotes by famous people were a nice touch All of the smaller parts were done well too 88 Keys Mandy Patinkin Flattop Mumbles Dustin Hoffman and the rest of the disfigured criminal elements were right on the mark My impression was that everybody was having a lot of fun with the part and played them to the hilt Tess Trueheart Glenn Headly turned in a good performance as Tracy s girlfriend and the Kid provided a light touch of humor Rating Classy stuff The comic book like use of color the make up the sets were all very well done Given my lack of familiarity with the history of Dick Tracy it was still easy to follow the movie except for trying to remember all the gangster names But if you can picture the face you can probably remember the name Great acting an okay plot good makeup and nice special effects earn this one a 4 stars excellent out of 4
0786,Die Hard 2,1990,Finally a movie which restores my faith in sequels After the disjointed disappointment of ROBOCOP 2 and the utter idiocy of GREMLINS 2 I must say I went into DIE HARDER with a few reservations Happily they were mostly proved unfounded Now make no mistakes the original DIE HARD was the superior movie of the two It was a fabulous thriller and a well planned action movie with plenty of amazing stunt work and expensive scenery chewing a pretty hard act to follow However DIE HARD 2 makes a valiant effort and with considerable success It certainly matches up in action and violence this was almost certainly a more expensive movie and the action stunt work and blowing up of expensive objects were all at least on par with the first I would go so far as to say that as an action movie this was superior to the original Where it falls a bit short is in the suspense end of the line DIE HARD 2 has few edge of your seat thrills little omigosh what s going to happen now indeed there s little room for this between the continuous stream of finding out what s going to happen mostly boom s The main cause for this is that while the first movie was placed in a skyscraper with close proximity between McClane and the Bad Guys tm no escape and the claustrophobic tension brought about by that DIE HARD 2 is set in a big open airport and the Bad Guys weren t even there for the most part instead having their base of operations in a nearby church Because of this there s few times we either are tensely expecting someone to jump out or are surprised by someone jumping out etc Despite this DIE HARD 2 succeeds well in being a non stop action movie It doesn t fall into the common trap of which even DIE HARD 1 was somewhat guilty of taking too long to get going the action is nearly from the word go Also the plotline while necessarily a bit credibility stretching these terrorists were really prepared for anything and over done was not distractingly so it followed its own lead all apparent inconsistencies were well explained and while several turns were pretty obvious there were a couple true surprise twists stuck in to keep things interesting On the other hand character development was a bit lax in this sequel McClane was again surprising and interesting but even he was somewhat flat the wry humor which was so common in the first movie was notably absent Also the other central characters were in the main pretty one dimensional and maybe even a little cliched I must say though I m only now thinking of these problems it s a tribute to the amount of sheer action in this movie that those flaws simply didn t occur to me while I was actually watching the thing I guess that makes them not really flaws doesn t it DIE HARD 2 tries to blow you away with action and it does that exceedingly well Principally because I prefer a good thriller I can t rate this one as well as the first but nonetheless it is far and away the best movie I ve seen yet this summer although I have yet to see DICK TRACY TOTAL RECALL or ANOTHER 48 HOURS If you enjoy a good slug blow up fest this is the movie to see definitely more so than ROBOCOP 2 and if having seen a few too many rotten flops you need something to convince you that a sequel to a good movie can be made and made well here s your choice Do note though that this really is not a movie to take the whole family to While many of the deaths involved seeing how many ways one can blow up airplanes there were a good number of unique and grisly ways to finish off your favorite enemy employed and plenty of bodies filled with lead and these people are every bit as foul mouthed as in the first DIE HARD 2 Rated R violence profanity Please note that the Overall rating is not designed to be an average or any sort of summary of the preceding ratings but rather a true rating of how good the movie was taken as a whole With four categories one can t fully rate all aspects of a movie nor should they all be weighted equally also as is the case with DIE HARD a movie can sometimes be more or in other cases less than the sum of its parts In the case of DIE HARD 2 the movie was exactly the sum of its parts fortunately most of the parts were pretty strong
0787,Die Hard 2,1990,The Los Angeles Times recently asked Where s this summer s blockbuster movie The answer is it s finally here and it s name is DIE HARD 2 I loved the original DIE HARD and I fully expected to be disappointed by the sequel Incredibly this movie is as engrossing and even more spectacular than the original The plot isn t all that important but it provides a good foundation for John McClane Bruce Willis vs the bad guys as in the original It s Christmas time again and McClane is at Dulles International Airport waiting for his wife s flight to arrive Also due to arrive is General Esperanza a deposed Latin American dictator who is being extradited to the U S to face drug charges Esperanza appears unruffled by his extradition and we quickly discover why A group of terrorists mercenaries take control of the airport and threaten mass destruction if Esperanza isn t released to them Of course McClane figures out that something nasty is occurring before anyone else And of course the local police don t listen to him This occurs in the first 15 20 minutes which leaves our hero Lieutenant John McClane now with the Los Angeles Police Department a good 90 minutes to kill bad guys get shot at and make wisecracks The story isn t highly original and it certainly isn t going to win an Academy Award for script writing but you don t go to an action film expecting an in depth character analysis Once the basic set up information is out of the way DIE HARD 2 takes off It rolls from shoot outs to explosions to chase scenes without letting you or McClane catch your breath The fast pace is perfect for this movie and it holds your attention from start to finish The bad guys are very bad The good guy is very good and very lucky The photography is impressive and the stunts and effects are stupendous Industrial Light Magic is at its peak once again ILM s models can easily convince you that you re looking at a real 747 This movie is at its finest in 70mm at a theater with a good sound system It is a perfect put your mind in neutral and kick back summer adventure movie
0788,Die Hard 2,1990,This year there is no James Bond film in fact but there is a reasonable substitute There is no film about British superspy James Bond being sent out to save England but there is a film about L A supercop John McClane sending himself out to pick up his wife from Dulles Airport in Washington D C McClane is played by Bruce Willis who is my idea of no actor but in films such as this can be a reasonable substitute Of course dealing with an airport during Christmas rush is never easy McClane has to deal with airport police who ticket him for parking in a no parking zone and with a bunch of Army bred mercenaries who are trying to free Manuel Noriega thinly disguised under the character name Esperanza DIE HARD 2 is the story of how McClane gets the airport police to tear up the parking ticket and how he picks up his wife on a night when Dulles is not at its dullest I will not say exactly how McClane gets the ticket torn up but it involves killing a bunch of bad guys and saving a lot of good guys to use his sophisticated jargon It also involves him being just about the only guy with intelligence and pluck in an airport full of and run by jerks DIE HARD 2 is a big beefy action film much in the style of a James Bond film It follows the time honored traditions of Bond films like all the luck working for the hero McClane makes no false moves while trained commandos make mistakes such as running out of ammunition without realizing it Eight bad guys can be having a showdown with McClane but they will very obligingly attack one at a time so McClane can pick them off like Horatio at the Bridge Later when there is one piece of equipment that McClane really needs it just sort of falls into his hands no muss no fuss That is not to say there is not a whole lot of mussing and fussing in the film But McClane is the sort of hero who can go through a trash compactor wince and maybe bleed a little to remind the audience that it is painful to be compacted and five minutes later he is back to normal His bones must be made of the stuff they built Patton tanks from or perhaps should build them from There are a number of reasons the plot could not really proceed as it does McClane gets an identification on a character based on fingerprints that he faxes from a car rental stand Even assuming he could coerce the car rental agency to do his faxing it is very unlikely the print at the other end would have anything but black blotches But I guess part of the fun of seeing a film like this is picking holes in the screenplay which in this case was written by Doug Richardson and Steven de Souza The latter wrote 48 HOURS and here is adapting 58 MINUTES the novel by Walter Wager on which DIE HARD 2 is based Visual effects are impressive and provided by Industrial Light and Magic One very nice shot involves McClane sort of flying away from an explosion but toward the camera The musical score is by Michael Kamen Rare is the film review that has a spoiler warning for a comment about the musical score but this one does Jump to the next paragraph if you wish to avoid it Through the film Kamen often uses a theme for the villains that sounds just like the first eight notes of Sibelius s Finlandia Well I had always thought they did sound ominous but was it coincidence or was Kamen really quoting Sibelius s tribute to Finland has after all little to do with the story at hand Then in the final suspense scene the orchestra finally breaks out into a big chunk of Finlandia The end credits then are a full orchestral performance of Finlandia It sounds mighty good in Dolby Surroundsound That s worth fifty cents of the admission price all by itself This is an enjoyable action film nothing requiring great thought but certainly enjoyable I would give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0789,Arachnophobia,1990,Do not see this movie if you actually are affected by arachnophobia fear of spiders in case you didn t know The friend I saw this with is a severe arachnophobe and he practically broke the poor chair he was sitting in by flying out of it so hard If you can guess from this that this is a scary movie well it is While it is marketing itself as a Thrill omedy this movie has much more thrill than omedy which is fine if that s what you re prepared for It also spends a good deal of its time in extreme close ups of spiders in action hence the opening warning Basic plot synopsis a large and ill tempered South American spider a new species no one knew of previously natch hitches a ride to a small backwoods town in the coffin of a photographer whom it had killed in the jungle It escapes into the local woods where it mates with a local spider and creates a whole bunch of deadly toxic mean spirited little spiders which take off to terrorize the town Most of this movie centers around the new local doctor s struggle to get people to believe that the deaths of several people were not cardiac arrests brought about by his own negligence as the old doctor would have it but are in fact attributable to these spiders Once real evidence is found for this a regional spider expert is brought in and the ground is laid for a plan to rid the town of the threat leading of course to a grand confrontation between the grandaddy spider and the doctor who of course has a serious fear of spiders due of course to an incident in his infancy You might have notice that this summary makes no mention of the role of the exterminator played by John Goodman who is in all the commercials This is because unfortunately he has very little screen time and is not at all important to the plot or development This is a real shame and a great waste of both a good character and a good actor The scenes involving Goodman are uniformly quite funny as his role as the down n dirty and rather thick headed exterminator is ideal for him and played to the hilt If this movie had been as I suspected Goodman s first real starring role and centered on his battle against the spiders with his spray gun this could have been a truly hysterical movie while still being a thriller Luckily the movie isn t a total loss without this indeed it s a reasonably enjoyable flick with many good scares plenty of spiders flying around and quite a few laughs along the way It s pretty formulaic beyond its unique plot device but still well done the plot and tension build nicely if a bit slowly and the climax is quite well climactic All the important characters are pretty well fleshed out The plot is sensible and has several sub plots which interact quite nicely And so on All in all this is a solid movie It could have been much better had it been as it is being marketed as a movie starring John Goodman as the back woods exterminator on a mission to save the town that could have been made into a truly funny cornball movie based on a thriller in the same style as the classic GHOSTBUSTERS the first one of course However when you realize that it isn t that movie you can enjoy what it is Check it out it s worth a look
0790,Ghost,1990,Things were going really well for Sam Wheat played by Patrick Swayze He had a great new yuppie apartment reclaimed from a really ugly building He had a live in roommate who would have looked like Demi Moore if she would only have let her hair grow a little She is Molly Jensen played by Demi Moore He had a high paying job as some sort of funds executive at a major bank His only problem was that he had a stupid name like Sam Wheat Then it all sours when he is killed by a hood on the street and has to get used to being dead You know it is not all pranks and chains being a ghost First of all there are very few people who can hear ghosts and who want to admit they can hear ghosts Then you have a really hard time interacting with matter Generally you go right through matter walls tables doors subway trains it makes no difference Floors seem to stop you but hey who wants to invest in a film about a dead bank executive falling to the center of the earth right Anyway there is more to Wheat s killing than meets the eye and his ghost wants to find out what it is His first big break is finding a kooky spiritualist medium who thinks she is a fake until she starts hearing the voice of one real ghost Oda Mae Brown played by Whoopi Goldberg wants nothing to do with Sam and her newly found powers Bruce Joel Rubin s script in the hands of Jerry Zucker who co wrote KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and co directed AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN has some nice shifts in mood These shifts from somber to funny have been criticized by some critics but given the subject matter are not unbelievable until the last five minutes or so The ending is saccharine not unexpectedly but up to that point the film s tone follows Wheat s emotions at being dead and let s face it finding yourself dead is one of life s more difficult moments Zucker did not have many somber moments in his previous films but he handles them well There is also a nice erotic scene with clay sculpture There is another love scene that might have broken new ground for a major release film had Zucker not copped out much to the indignation of the audience There is also a rather unexpected and nice scene involving a grungy subway rider GHOST is not really very good as a ghost story There is maybe one decent chilling scene in the film Next to LADY IN WHITE or THE UNINVITED it pales considerably But it is reasonable as a slick Hollywood production with of course effects by Industrial Light and Magic I rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0791,Ghost,1990,Cast Patrick Swayze Demi Moore Whoopi Goldberg Sam Wheat Patrick Swayze and Molly Jensen Demi Moore have just renovated a loft and moved into it Sam is an investment banker Molly is a ceramicist They re a nice couple they seem to balance each other in a satisfying way Very much in love they re entering a deeper phase of commitment which is rudely interrupted by a mugger who kills Sam in front of Molly Sam watches over his own death and is as horrified as Molly especially since he finds he s incapable of comforting her As we watch him follow Molly and watch over her in his old uhm haunts sorry couldn t resist we feel his frustration and depression Demi Moore can look so vulnerable that the audience joins Sam in wanting to put an arm around her One day when she goes out for a walk Sam remains in the loft and discovers that his mugging wasn t an accident he was murdered Worse he recognizes that Molly is in yes you ve guessed it grave danger and he must find a way to protect her In desperation Sam goes to the storefront business of Oda Mae Whoopi Goldberg a con artist whose latest con is spiritual advising No one is more surprised than Oda Mae when she does actually hear a voice from beyond Therein starts the comic combination that develops into a truly entertaining set of scenes Goldberg plays this role with such relish that we willingly go along for the ride Sam pesters Oda Mae until she reluctantly agrees to talk with Molly but convincing Molly of Sam s ghost turns into a very difficult project not at all aided by the fact that Oda Mae has one hell of a police record for swindling Sam meanwhile needs to find out who was in charge of his murder While pursuing his mugger Sam is terrorized by a ghost on one of the subways This ghost can affect the real world in a way that Sam can t Eventually Sam learns a thing or two from an old ghost The rest of the film shows Sam having an increased effect on the real world and there s no way I ll tell you in advance what happens Now for a look at the style of this film what worked and what didn t The humor works It develops organically from the situation and the characters and it s a necessary component in this film Although a local critic felt that the film bounced too much between being a romance and being lighthearted I can t agree with the criticism If it weren t for the humor the film would slip into pure sap without style As previously mentioned Goldberg plays her part with gusto and Swayze is as believable a ghost as I ve ever uhm seen The music works as you ve probably already surmised by previous comments in the rec arts movies group Unchained Melody always seemed a sentimental piece that I liked for its pure romanticism Now I ll think of it and this movie as a unit The performances work they were nearly perfect for this movie I m not usually a fan of Swayze but as someone else on the net pointed out he s a very physical kind of actor and he did a fine job After you see this movie try to imagine someone else playing Sam Wheat I can t think of anyone who d be better here Demi Moore also is irreplaceable in this film She maintains a very sweet sadness throughout the film entirely believable entirely appropriate It s only when you consider that she spent 6 7ths of the movie with tears rolling down her face that you realize her role didn t have much meat She managed very well And I ve already expressed delight with Whoopi Goldberg No one else could have played her role as well as she The special effects work most of the time However I m not convinced that it was necessary to show us the difference between being sucked up by good ghosts vs bad ghosts it looked downright corny to me Another complaint one of the special effects toward the end was gruesome I m less willing to forgive that I firmly believe that explicit violence and comedy are mutually exclusive The ending was I suppose a natural consequence of the preceding events but it seemed a trite too silly and it tried a bit too hard to tug at the heartstrings For anyone who s interested I ve been thinking of alternative endings and I d be interested in exchanging email about it All in all though this was an entertaining movie that makes me miss movies about people and the connections between them It s not a statement movie so you probably won t go home a better person but you ll probably enjoy at least the love scenes between Sam and Molly and the humorous scenes between Sam and Oda Mae And maybe you too will find the old fashioned idea of eternal love a compelling notion
0792,Quick Change,1990,Capsule review The clever heist story fades into a Murphy s Law sort of getaway Three thieves find out just how unfriendly New York City can be There are several well defined characters created but unfortunately the three main characters are not them Rating 1 There are really two stories to QUICK CHANGE The first story is about twenty minutes long and is the story of The Bank Robbery The second story is the story of The Getaway The idea behind the robbery is clever It is done in a way that has not been done in heist films before it I figured the gimmick out in advance but I am told that puts me in a minority Word of mouth indicates that many viewers are taken by surprise by the gimmick of the robbery The Getaway is also well done but in a very different vein All the clockwork planning falls apart as three partners in crime try to get from a New York bank to JFK airport Here no new ground is broken Several films have been made about what a hostile and frustrating place New York City is Notable examples are THE OUT OF TOWNERS and AFTER HOURS QUICK CHANGE is slightly lower key and more believable than those films but it too is a compendium of the irritating frustrations and rude people in New York City woven together by a connecting story The attempts to get to the airport become more frantic as more and more obstacles fall into the intrepid gang s way Bill Murray co produced co directed and co starred Howard Franklin co directed as well as wrote the screenplay based on a book by Jay Cronley Murray plays the absurdly laid back Grimm Murray sacrifices much of the absurd gamut of frustrations by maintaining an even keel throughout As a counterpoint Randy Quaid plays Loomis who constantly walks the narrow line between panic and hysteria Of the three thieves the only character who has any depth is Geena Davis s Phyllis who is re evaluating her future while they fights their way to the airport pursued by the slightly too intuitive Chief Rotzinger played by Jason Robards Jr QUICK CHANGE does have a few belly laughs but it is not trying constantly to be uproarious as so many current comedies are More often it contents itself with being whimsical and sly This approach would normally require a much better definition of the three main characters than Franklin was able to provide but ironically it is not the main characters he develops Instead he develops the minor characters and then lets them upstage the stars We better understand a bank guard played by Bob Elliot of the Bob and Ray team than we do either if the two male leads The audience has less sympathy and interest invested in them than in a cabbie who speaks and understands no recognizable language An officious bus driver played by Philip Bosco is as well developed as Randy Quaid s character with far less screen time By blurring the foreground characters and focusing on the background New York City becomes the real main character of the film until the script falters near the end and Murray once again reclaims the audience s attention I rate the film a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0793,Arachnophobia,1990,One tends to expect new ideas in films from Steven Spielberg s Amblin Entertainment And with Disney Enterprises starting a new film branch Hollywood Pictures you would expect something fairly original to inaugurate the new label That makes it all the more puzzling that this collaboration between Amblin Entertainment and Hollywood Pictures would be a plot that was already old when Spielberg made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND There have already been so many Invasion of the Killer Vermin films that one more is no novelty In other films we have seen people threatened by infestations of spiders ants birds slugs rats bats feral dogs bears even frogs Don t ask me how you make a threat out of a frog I saw the film and still don t know You have to be pretty desperate for phobias to make a film about killer frogs However well a new film of this type is done and ARACHNOPHOBIA was nicely executed there is not much new you can put into a film about a small town threatened by an infestation of deadly spiders The idea of the film is that there is a prehistoric breed of spider one with a very different social structure from what modern spiders have living isolated in the jungles of Venezuela This breed of spider has a king and a bunch of drones much like bees have with a queen and drones That is something of a stretch since spiders are much more closely related to sea crustaceans than they are to insects A plot device that could have been devised by Rube Goldberg takes the king spider and drops him quite literally into the backyard of a new doctor in a small California town Dr Ross Jennings played by Jeff Daniels has a bugaboo about spiders and the fact that he has a barn full of them is only one of the many problems he is facing as a result of moving to Canaima California from San Francisco There are in fact many elements of the plot that executive producer Steven Spielberg might have found extremely familiar We have one lone man who is not really accepted by his town who has to convince disbelieving officials that they have a problem He has his own phobias to overcome but the love of his family charmingly portrayed convinces him that he has to overcome his fears and see that the problem gets solved Luckily he has a knowledgeable expert he can call on to help him out and to explain to the audience how scary the situation really is Surely all this must have rung a bell somewhere in Spielberg s memory What is nice about the film is that it takes the time to develop characters so that the audience has some understanding and empathy invested in them That too makes the film seem as if it were really a 1970s film The viewer gets to know the people who are threatened by the spiders not as well as you get to know the Brodie family in JAWS but far better than you know anyone in most current horror films Nobody follows the new popular formula of being introduced and making vacuous or stereotyped conversation then being quickly dispatched to nobody s regret The effects work usually is believable though occasionally a spider just does not scramble right A fair number of live spiders were also sued and unfortunately the film bears no endorsement of the filming practices by any humane society ARACHNOPHOBIA is entertaining and has some genuinely creepy moments but lacks anything that really distinguishes it from other films with very similar plots and approaches I give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0794,Monsieur Hire,1989,Cast Michel Blanc Sandrine Bonnaire Andre Wilms Luc Thuillier Monsieur Hire Michel Blanc is an enigmatic tailor who is watched suspiciously by his neighbors His pale face rigidly upright posture and meticulous hygiene are unusual enough but his unsmiling and piercing gaze set him quite apart from the masses Hire is not a sociable man and more than his posture seems rigid when we first meet him We see him watching the rest of the world and we understand that he is apart from that world he is detached an observer What goes on inside his head is a mystery A murder in the neighborhood causes the finger of suspicion to point toward the unusual Monsieur Hire His neighbors fear him but his pets white mice do not When one mouse dies he carefully wraps the little form in a swatch of fabric We begin to glimpse Hire but we must be voyeurs to unravel his story because much of the information we need is visual Of course this voyeurism on the audience s part is more than just a device In order to catch a thief so the saying goes one must be a thief Monsieur Hire is a voyeur so we become voyeurs in order to know him We watch him watching his neighbor Alice Sandrine Bonnaire We watch her watching him watch her We watch Alice s boyfriend Luc Thuillier and Alice We watch the investigator Andre Wilms watching Hire We watch scene after scene in the same way a nosy neighbor hides behind drapes while looking out the window And we begin to sense that someone knows something that he or she wants to know if anyone else knows Confusing Not when you re watching This unusual film explores trust and suspicion passion and detachment hope and hopelessness Peter Travers Rolling Stone magazine noted that this film is shot in extremely wide Panavision making the faces startlingly close and vivid We know those faces intimately as intimately as if we were watching them from inches away Yet we keep examining those faces for more clues because no matter how close we are we need an interpreter a Greek chorus to tell us what we re seeing Leconte has solicited highly charged yet subtle performances from Blanc and Bonnaire Under his direction the film emerges as a coherent thriller which has prompted critics to admire both the style and the content of this movie This film deserves that acclaim
0795,Presumed Innocent,1990,Capsule review A tightly plotted mystery that often threatens to leave loose ends and them very cleverly ties them all together Harrison Ford again plays a cipher the audience is not intended to understand but how many more such roles can he find Recommended for Agatha Christie fans Rating high 2 At the risk of starting this review with a very mild spoiler I will say that not until the final seconds of this film does one recognize what a clever and well constructed plot this film really has In the tradition of the best of Agatha Christie a tight and complex knot comes apart with one deceptively simple tug The story of PRESUMED INNOCENT is not told in an Agatha Christie storybook style at all Instead it is told with a harder and more realistic edge The backdrop is the highly politicized office of the Prosecuting Attorney Harrison Ford plays Rusty Sabich an assistant to the Prosecuting Attorney investigating the rape murder of an attractive and ambitious co worker But his investigation is cut short by a political reversal that not only leaves the investigation in another Prosecutor s hands but also leaves Rusty the prime suspect for the crime The one dramatic problem with the film is that the audience is intentionally placed outside the action Through the whole film much more than is necessary or even realistic Rusty Sabich is an enigma The audience is desperate to hear his side of the accusation but frustratingly it is kept from us We get details about Sabich about as frequently and easily as the rival prosecutor does And matters are not helped by having Harrison Ford in the role Ford plays the role extremely blandly and woodenly Even as a man going through some serious crises it is very hard to believe Ford as a successful attorney and assistant to the Prosecutor Alan Pakula directed PRESUMED INNOCENT from a script that is very tightly written by Frank Pierson and Pakula It builds its view of what actually happened a bit at a time with a very slow painstaking introduction of clues much like Pakula s ALL THE PRESIDENT S MEN Brian Dennehy plays the Chief Prosecutor Raymond Horgan and honkers down in his role with his usual apparent ease Raul Julia plays Sabich s attorney as just a bit dishonest Bonnie Bedelia plays Rusty s wife and Greta Scaachi plays the victim whom we see a lot considering her short screen time PRESUMED INNOCENT is a real attention holder that is solid plot and no filler I rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0796,Mo Better Blues,1990,Impressions from last week s sneak preview of Spike Lee s newest MO BETTER BLUES The following may contain some minor spoilers for those who like absolutely no prior information It stars Denzel Washington Spike Lee Wesley Snipes the Spike Lee Regulars Joie Lee Bill Nunn Giancarlo Esposito John Turturro and newcomer Cynda Williams It s the story of Bleek Gilliam jazz trumpeter and band leader for whom composing and playing and having absolute control of his music is the takes precedence over all other facets of his life including the juggling relationships with two women and creative and business conflicts within the band Bleek refuses to make a commitment to either woman or to allow other members of the band to make contributions At times it occurred to me that it was a cross between PURPLE RAIN and SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT Technically Spike has never been better Sometimes you re too aware of the camerawork but when he s on as he is much more frequently than not it s an unmatchable combination of artistry and entertainment The cinematography is the best I ve seen in a long long time Three outstanding sequences come to mind First a scat rap number by Bleek about the sameness of Top 40 love songs is outstanding especially after you breathe a sigh of relief at knowing that Denzel isn t going to try to actually sing If someone has any kind of sense they ll try to market it as a single Second a hilarious scene when Bleek does the absolute worse thing a man involved with two women can do And last in a summer of escalating cartoon violence Spike Lee reminds us in excruciating detail how devastating real violence is The storyline itself is rather uneven many strong scenes interspersed with some weak ones It seems Spike had specific points he wanted to get to even if he didn t always know how to get there And the last ten minutes of the film is a miscalculation a forced happy ending Even then it s clear that Spike was reaching for a specific point it just doesn t work However his failure comes from aiming a lot higher than probably anyone else would Actually an informal consensus on the ending was that Denzel got away with what he did only because he was Denzel guys don t try this at home Denzel Washington is absolutely magnificent in his first truly three dimensional role The rest of the cast particularly Wesley Snipes as Shadow Bleek s saxophonist and rival and Cynda Williams as Clarke one of Bleek s girlfriends who wants to become a singer Rueben Blades and the late Robin Harris show up in bit parts Oh yeah If you re one of those who consider a movie unrealistic if black people aren t taking drugs you won t like this one either
0797,Freshman The,1990,Capsule review College freshman takes a part time job working for a well known organized crime figure then finds himself sinking in deeper and deeper Well drawn characters salvage a less than original plot Rating low 2 Marlon Brando does not particularly like THE FRESHMAN Or so he said at the close of the shooting for the film And I suppose I can see his point The basic plot for THE FRESHMAN is not all that original and in less skilled hands this could have been a very forgettable film It gets very few points for originality Still even a film made with a very tired motif can be done with some style and can still be a quality film This is yet another film of someone in his late teens just trying to go to school or going to summer camp but getting embroiled in screwball circumstances Deep down this is another teen comedy but like RISKY BUSINESS or THE GRADUATE there is a little more substance here than in most teen comedies and it should appeal to a larger audience Matthew Broderick plays Charles Kellogg who is starting college at New York University s film school Or at least he is trying to but all his bags and money are stolen His attempts to get them back take a strange turn when the hood who took them offers Kellogg a great job in return for the money which the hood has gambled away The great job turns out to be running errands for Carmine Sabatini played by Marlon Brando who doesn t just look like Vito Corleone from THE GODFATHER he apparently IS the Godfather The first job is to pick up SOMETHING at the airport and deliver it to New Jersey His payment is to be 500 for a few hours work Andrew Bergman who both wrote and directed THE FRESHMAN has a good feel for bizarre and comic characters We get to meet some of the most quirky members of the underworld since POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES including a bon vivant ex Nazi hiding behind the obvious alias of Larry London played by Maximillian Schell Much has been made of how good Brando is in his role though I am not convinced that it is as difficult a part as other reviewers seem to think Also Brando now has the stature of someone eating himself to death and should take better care of himself Cinema fans should enjoy all the references to classic films to be found in the film school scenes and pretty much everybody will enjoy some of the comedy scenes such as the pickup at the airport In general this is a well made comedy that transcends its formula I would rate this a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0798,Flatliners,1990,Horror films tend to be very derivative They take many of the same themes and rework them over and over How different is FRIGHT NIGHT from DRACULA really It is very rare for me to come out of a horror film feeling I had seen something really new for the horror film And be warned usually when I feel have seen something new most audiences do not like the films In the last ten years there have been five horror films I have liked in this way They are SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES LIFEFORCE PRINCE OF DARKNESS LADY IN WHITE and now FLATLINERS FLATLINERS is a mesmerizing horror thriller about life and death and redemption From about two minutes into the film I was constantly anxious to find out what happens next And when it did happen I was never disappointed but still never appeased A group of medical students are fascinated by the brink of death experience that some of their patients have had But their curiosity certainly goes beyond just collecting other peoples accounts second hand As long as they have the ability to induce death and to bring people back why wait for it to happen by chance and to other people Why not go off exploring the undiscovered country for themselves As one student says of the quest to know what is beyond death Philosophy failed Religion failed Now it s time for medical science to try So one tries it and is brought back But now things seem different to him and reality is not quite the same At least in theme FLATLINERS is reminiscent of some of the classic old Karloff films like Michael Curtiz s THE WALKING DEAD and where that film was a little pat in its description of life after death Karloff just had time to describe it as peace before dying a second time and more permanently this film is only a little less pat in other ways in its meaning of death However it is not concentrating so much on what the other side looks like as on what it is like to have been there and be back This is a movie to see in a theater it will lose a lot of its visual impact on the small screen Almost the entire film is shot in either twilight half tones or at night The medical school has got to be the most baroque in the world It would have done credit to any 1930s expressionistic horror film Its architecture is almost gothic with immense vaulting rooms dark dismal corridors labs with immense statue heads as if gods were looking on Director Joel Schumacher s previous THE LOST BOYS had little to recommend it but atmosphere This time he has better atmosphere and a far more compelling story to tell Kiefer Sutherland of LOST BOYS plays Nelson who is exploring death partially for curiosity and partially for glory Julia Roberts is Rachel who has her own private demons to face Roberts has the best developed character Keith Bacon is Davis who is just a little too good to be true Alec Baldwin s younger brother William plays Joe whose story is somewhat less interesting than the others and could by itself have been an episode of The Hitchhiker FLATLINERS is intelligently filmed and written It has irony but happily not apparently tongue in cheek In short it deserves to be a classic horror film and may well make it I rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0799,Two Jakes The,1990,Just got back from watching THE TWO JAKES the sequel to Chinatown directed by Jack Nicholson This will not contain any spoilers so those of you paranoid about getting your movie experienced destroyed by them may breathe easy This is meant more as a description of my feelings after seeing this movie Well first of all I am extremely happy to note that Jack Nicholson has resisted the temptation to make a popular movie quick cuts upbeat soundtrack lots of action lots of sex but instead has opted to make a good film It might not appeal to the 18 25 year old crowd but who really cares about them This movie takes off a few years after CHINATOWN and Nicholson reprises his role as Jake Gittes Private Investigator It seems that the years have been good to Jake as his business has expanded but that he is still pre occupied with the past of Chinatown So much for plot summary go see it if you want to know what the story is The movie is exceptionally well made and very pleasant to watch if you are a fan of the original CHINATOWN Nicholson has obviously gone to great trouble to recreate the same atmosphere and ambiance the original gave the audience The movie just felt good down to the quality of the color and the cinematography beautifully executed by Vilmos Zsigismond Visually the movie is stunning but fortunately the storyline and continuity in my opinion were not disregarded either The story kept me at the edge of my seat though slow at times yet it kept serving up surprises and twists especially every time I thought I had it all figured out Just as it was a joy to watch the handiwork of Nicholson The Director it was equally pleasant to watch Nicholson The Actor in action then again name one movie where that was not the case with the possible exception of THE RAVEN and LITTLE SHOP All I can say is that this movie is definitely worth watching if you would like to see a GOOD movie for a change reminiscent of a time when such movies were still made
0801,Taking Care of Business,1991,CAPSULE REVIEW Charles Grodin plays a keyed up yuppie who loses his datebook on the way to an important weekend meeting The book is found by James Belushi who uses it to take on Grodin s identity Belushi has escaped temporarily from jail to go watch the Cubs in the World Series Improbable movie with a lot of cheap jokes but a few funny ones too RATING 1 1 2 Film opens August 17 TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS a film by Hollywood Pictures starring James Belushi and Charles Grodin explores what it thinks is the nightmare of every overworked yuppie losing one s Filofax For anyone else like me who doesn t know what a Filofax is it s one of those little notebooks that organizes your life into schedules phone number lists credit card holders and calendars Grodin plays overachiever ad exec Spencer Barnes who loses his datebook on the way to a weekend meeting in Malibu with a big client The book is found by Jimmy Dworski Belushi a convict who escaped from jail for the weekend to go watch the World Series Jimmy uses the Filofax to pick up where Spencer left off enjoying the rich life in Malibu before the game while Spencer searches frantically to find out who has taken his identity away from him And the movie does nothing but get more improbable from there It s no accident that the screenwriters decided to put the Cubs in the World Series when the Cubs haven t won a series since 1908 The movie goes for every cheap joke it can find and it finds no lack of opportunities To its credit it does hit with some good gags It would be hard to miss every time with Charles Grodin and James Belushi on the screen The movie takes the safe numbingly predictable path and lets the comic talent of its stars compensate for lack of tension photography and script It follows the same plot lines that have been done as recently as in OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS although this film does it better and as long ago as in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS trumpets the pitfalls of becoming obsessed with work and being unable to enjoy life But while the film encourages Spencer as he learns to leave his Filofax behind at the same time the movie is a commercial for Filofax Everyone in this movie owns and admires the Filofax The camera takes long loving looks at how organized the datebook can be and how useful it should be We even get to shop the variety of colors and styles the datebook is available in Filofax does have a great racket going Their trademark is officially associated with the film so they get all the exposure in the movie certainly no one has any datebooks that aren t Filofax plus their name is plastered in every review and promotion the movie gets As I said the movie does hit with some funny lines If you re in the mood to turn off your brain for a couple of hours spending a matinee show in TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS wouldn t be a bad idea But if you can t turn off those nagging doubts and do get turned off by easy jokes your time is better spent elsewhere Rating 1 1 2 out of 4 to 4
0802,Air America,1990,The first comment I have to make about this movie is that the trailers for it and the television advertisements are grossly misleading The most visible example is the fact that many of the trailer s scenes are not even in the movie For instance the trailer shows Gibson and Downey walking together having the following conversation In the movie all that happens is Gibson says Anything anywhere any time That s our motto Another example is that the trailers and ads show Gibson calmly chomping on a sandwich while his plane goes up in a ball of fire This scene is actually a collection of clips from two separate scenes taken completely out of context Granted this is a nit But in general the trailers and ads make this movie out to be a fun loving comedy It is not The movie has some pretty dark tones to it and parts of it will depress the hell out of you Don t go to this movie if you are simply looking for fun you will be largely disappointed I was really offended by the extent to which the ads portrayed this movie as something it isn t Don t get me wrong Parts of this movie are very funny But the movie s subject deals with a rather embarrassing aspect of American history the fact that the CIA was maintaining a covert distribution system of virtually any imaginable commodity including body parts according to Gibson on Arsenio Hall and that this system ran a fair amount of drugs all in the name of national security And it would not have done the subject justice if they had played it as a comedy The movie starts with a young California chopper pilot losing his license essentially due to stunt flying a radio station s traffic chopper He is promptly recruited by the CIA to fly for Air America the CIA s distribution network in Laos Once in Laos he finds himself in the midst of a number of pilots who are bordering on insanity He even remarks on how strange it is for him to find himself as the most normal person in the room The movie goes on to describe various incidents involving different deliveries and what happens on the way Incidental to the plot is a US senator on a fact finding mission and the attempts to placate him while keeping him in the dark The problem that I had with the movie was that it was unwilling to commit to any particular plot twist There are a number of opportunities for the story to take on a potentially challenging approach but it consistently heads in one direction only to veer off right away A potential romance is set up between Downey s character and an idealistic USAID worker but nothing ever comes of it A dramatic confrontation between one of the heavies and Downey s character is in the making but again nothing happens The movie has no climax per se Rather it sets up a number of minor climactic moments with no real surprise endings to any of them Essentially other than to say Hey look what the US government was up to this movie doesn t say or do anything remarkable The only other plot aspect that interested or surprised me was the senator s final stand What is most interesting about the movie is the characterization of the pilots involved Downey is a rather idealistic rebel who is trapped in a situation where he must deal with unpleasantness in order to do what he loves to do Gibson is a man who sees any moralizing about his situation to be a futile exercise He is solely interested in becoming independent enough to do his own thing The pilots in general are aware of the roles that they are playing and they are fatalistic in their view of their roles They spend their time alternately dealing with a bureaucracy which is looking for scapegoats and unfriendlies who are looking to kill Americans and they walk the line between sanity and insanity in an effort to cope with it All that has value to them is each other and they are fiercely protective of each other My gut reaction to this movie is So what It has no message it doesn t know how to take itself which means that the audience doesn t either Gibson gets to put more into a character than he s been able to do in the past Downey is playing a familiar role but one which is still sympathetic If you re going to go see this movie go for the characters not the plot and certainly not for the humor
0803,Flatliners,1990,It s been a long tedious and violence prone summer for the Phantom and he s been getting a little edgy Reviewing s in his blood now and it s been nearly three months since his last reviews for CLASS OF 1999 and BRAIN DEAD Since then he s been subjected to more violence thinly disguised as pop entertainment than even Steven King in his wildest dreams possibly could have imagined The combined body counts of TOTAL RECALL ROBOCOP 2 DIE HARD 2 and PRESUMED INNOCENT well to be fair PRESUMED INNOCENT s body count was on the low side exceeded even the Phantom s threshold for violence sometime in mid July for him the cold dark days of autumn and winter and the dozens of horror films they ll bring will seem like welcome relief indeed Which brings us in a rather roundabout way to the subject of this review For a film that is ostensibly about dying it s curious that no one dies in FLATLINERS at least not for long Although the film is as much of a horror film as was THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST FLATLINERS ties PRESUMED INNOCENT as the summer s film with the lowest body count Before the Phantom even gets started reviewing the film he would like to say that he finds this both remarkable and quite refreshing it wasn t too long ago that filmmakers knew how to make films both horror and legitimate in ways that didn t involve killing more people on screen than they disappointed in the auditorium FLATLINERS starts with the tired old notion of near death experiences takes a detour somewhere around ELM STREET and winds up as a visual homage to one of the most stylish horror films of all time THE HUNGER Along the way the director Joel Schumacher reminds us of just what made 1987 s THE LOST BOYS so enjoyable and why he is one of the best and most stylish directors making B grade movies today The film itself is best described as a rollercoaster ride a lot of fun while you re speeding around turns and checking your seat restraints but not very memorable afterward To its credit the film makes believable the shaky notion that a bunch of photogenic medical students with no homework labwork and just the occasional round to make can repeatedly induce brain death in each other for periods of time greater even than the length of the commercials preceding the film and then unfailingly resuscitate each other bringing each other back to life and suffering no more brain damage than has the script Having established that which is no mean feat Schumacher uses the near death experiences to fashion a film that blends the best of the ELM STREET series with the sensibility of a 90 minute MTV longform video Yet regardless of what you think of the subject matter or even of the film itself there is no denying that Schumacher s cinematography his ability to set a scene and generate suspense and his ability to use sound effects and lighting techniques effectively is virtually unequaled in the world of the horror film Sam Raimi and the Coen brothers have shown the same skill with the EVIL DEAD series BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA and of course Ridley Scott s films define the genre of techno style but Schumacher s talents have improved in the years since THE LOST BOYS and at this point the Phantom has to rank him right up there with Sam Joel and Ethan Schumacher keeps the film moving along and it s good that he does since otherwise the audience would have time to consider just how trite and obvious the plot is The Phantom is not going to drop any spoilers but if there is a single phan out there who can t guess both where the film is going and how it ends by the time Kevin Bacon goes under the Phantom will be most surprised THE LOST BOYS suffered from similar problems of course as modern day vampire stories go it doesn t hold a silver bullet to NEAR DARK But at least THE LOST BOYS had interesting characters generally witty dialogue and a script that doesn t sound as if the closest it ever came to a second draft was when the writer left some of the windows in his apartment open To say that the characters in FLATLINERS are two dimensional would be to insult the Cartesian coordinate system they each have one dimension and they each stick to that dimension throughout the film Kiefer Sutherland is the driven slightly bad guy Kevin Bacon is the brilliant unstable yet reliable guy Julia Roberts keeps us all waiting for the scene where they perform CPR on her and in general never allows the word collagen to leave our thoughts etc etc But we don t go to horror films expecting great originality do we phans Although the occasional diamond in the rough like the EVIL DEAD series or last spring s BRAIN DEAD helps us recall that it is possible to be both creative and stylish all too frequently we are forced to settle for films that are neither That FLATLINERS is so very stylish is a distinct plus and Schumacher handles the film so well that the Phantom was more than willing to overlook the bumpy plot and the less than surprising surprises The film is set in Chicago but only barely As he did with THE LOST BOYS Schumacher has used various unrelated sets and city backdrops in a way that creates a private world for the film FLATLINERS is not set in any recognizable part or suburb of Chicago though alumni of Loyola may recognize some of the more striking buildings in the film But for the most part the characters in FLATLINERS exist in their own world a world of colored lights fog and the night it s almost always night during the film and when it isn t night it s dark or cloudy Phans of THE LOST BOYS will recognize some of Schumacher s signature elements of style but FLATLINERS has many of its own it is obviously related to THE LOST BOYS but it doesn t look like a clone One interesting new affectation is having large sheets of clear plastic draped over almost everything in sight this was done to such excess that the Phantom thought that all of Chicago was undergoing massive asbestos removal procedures And Schumacher s swooping and diving camera is back but his technique has improved in the years since THE LOST BOYS In FLATLINERS he makes use of all the tricks of the music video trade including black white photography purposely grainy or flat photography washed out or oversaturated color etc There are also a good number of monitors of various kinds scattered throughout the film and Schumacher even cribs a bit from SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE For better or worse and the in the Phantom s opinion better FLATLINERS plays more like a longform video than like a film By the film s end the Phantom was reminded of Tony Scott s 1983 film THE HUNGER a vampire film that was exquisitely bad though very very stylish Schumacher is not a talentless hack like Scott FLATLINERS is nothing if not entertaining Whereas THE HUNGER was a feast for the eyes and a famine for the mind FLATLINERS keeps us entertained and happy as long as we don t spend too much time trying to predict the outcome of the next scene or even what the next scene will be for alas all too often we are correct and left to wonder why someone didn t put as much effort into the story as Schumacher had obviously put into filming it And it s at the end when things start winding down and heading toward their all too predictable conclusion that the Phantom found his interest in the film flatlining or at least faultering FLATLINERS is a good 10 minutes too long and the ending is so disappointing that it stands a good chance of ruining what is otherwise a very entertaining if brainless film for those phans who expected to see a horror film that had the courage of its convictions The ending phans is an ending only a studio executive or a parent could love it is a near perfect mass market movie of the week ending The Phantom even felt that it gave THE ABYSS a run for its money as the world s most abysmal ending but in the end his conclusion is that THE ABYSS is still reigning champion Things start going astray once it becomes obvious that the film has a GHOST like heart to it all the malevolence chills and thrills of the first half start to disappear like a vampire exposed to daylight and the audience is left with 20 minutes of pointless exposition that leads inexorably to a conclusion worthy only of our strongest excoriation All right perhaps that was reaching a bit but the Phantom hasn t visited his old friend Roget in quite a while In a word phans the ending is execrable Now that was reaching But don t let the lousy ending keep you from seeing FLATLINERS after all if the Phantom avoided every film that ended badly he d be able to get his library books back on time and he d rarely have to clean the heads on his VCR Like THE LOST BOYS FLATLINERS is wonderful fun while you re in the theater and though you will most likely be groaning along with the rest of the audience by the film s end you won t be bored for the 90 minutes preceding it
0804,Two Jakes The,1990,THE TWO JAKES is a failure on two different fronts three if you believe the weekend box office figures that show it was only the seventh biggest draw in its opening weekend It fails as a sequel to CHINATOWN and it fails as an independent movie People who haven t seen CHINATOWN or don t remember it won t understand much of what s going on while people who have will probably judge THE TWO JAKES harshly in comparison Both groups are liable to find it overlong and slow Jake Gittes the private investigator from CHINATOWN is back with World War II under his belt and success in his profession that approaches respectability But he s still haunted by the ghosts of his past When a seemingly routine divorce case explodes in his face the past rushes in to envelop him He s faced with the challenge of solving his immediate problems while simultaneously reconciling with the past Of course the past and the present prove to be inextricably linked Jack Nicholson returns as Jake Gittes and also directs the film In addition he did some rewriting of Robert Towne s script at the minimum the narration is Nicholson s He proves himself an excellent actor a reasonable writer and a pedestrian director Gittes is a very finely delineated character with great depths and complexities Nicholson builds the character not just with his dialog but with his expressions his gestures his costumes and his surroundings Nicholson s performance is one of the best of the year and one reason to see THE TWO JAKES The script is not such a good reason Towne has not provided as strong a story for THE TWO JAKES as he did for CHINATOWN nor are the supporting characters as interesting Towne did write some good lines and decent scenes but failed in terms of the overall script He relies rather heavily on echoing CHINATOWN two thugs menace Jake there s an elderly mysterious rich man changes of land titles figure heavily in the plot The idea was probably to set up resonances in the minds of both Gittes and the audience but it doesn t work The mystery isn t good enough either We may not guess everything that s going on but we don t care enough about the resolution The narration added by Nicholson works reasonably well showing how completely Nicholson has absorbed the character of Gittes CHINATOWN had as its roots the politics and business of water in Los Angeles in the thirties THE TWO JAKES attempts to build itself around the politics and business of oil in Los Angeles in the late forties But oil does not permeate the atmosphere of the film in the same way water did in CHINATOWN In that film drought brought the importance of water to the forefront The first film also used water visually in a way that THE TWO JAKES fails to use oil Oil wells are scattered all around and everyone talks about how rich and important oil men are but the film does not demonstrate in its plot or its visuals how oil was the lifeblood of Los Angeles in this period THE TWO JAKES also fails to develop the atmosphere of CHINATOWN In CHINATOWN corruption was present everywhere a miasma like precursor to Los Angeles smog The entire city seemed entwined in a web of venality and evil Shadowy lighting moody music eccentric characters and clever camera movement created a unique feel for the film THE TWO JAKES is lacking that feel It isn t the same sort of film at all Vilmos Zgismond the cinematographer creates some very beautiful shots reminiscent of the first film but Nicholson the director does not show the visual imagination that Roman Polanski brought to CHINATOWN Surprisingly he doesn t have the vicious snap that Polanski did There s no moment in THE TWO JAKES that has the same punch as the scene in CHINATOWN where the two hoods slashed Jake Gittes nose That scene showed the immediate nastiness of violence in a way that dozens of stunt men being jerked backwards by simulated gunshots does not and Polanski was able to use it to wake up the audience to the possibility that bad things might really happen to people they cared about Nicholson provides no similar moment in THE TWO JAKES that makes dangers real to the audience One element Nicholson does try to reproduce is the careful pacing of Polanski s film Polanski knows how to take his time and paced CHINATOWN very deliberately Nicholson clearly saw that Polanski did this but doesn t seem able to copy the style successfully Instead of drawing the viewers in with a lazy seductiveness the pacing of THE TWO JAKES bores them Nicholson s best directorial moments in the film come when he is going for an entirely different style one that verges on the surrealistic and slapstick It might be going too far to suggest that THE TWO JAKES demonstrates that Nicholson can t direct but he surely can t imitate Roman Polanski very well THE TWO JAKES does have some strengths As mentioned Nicholson s performance is excellent as is the cinematography The period detail is nicely presented as well giving the film a beautiful look The supporting cast is filled with fine actors doing good work though in some cases they have far too little to work with Eli Wallach Frederic Forrest and Richard Farnsworth simply don t have the screentime or material to make a strong impression Meg Tilly provides her usual strong performance Harvey Keitel is good as the second Jake of the title and Ruben Blades does a nice turn as a gangster David Keith is suitably vicious as a rotten cop and Tom Waits has an unbilled scene as the other half of Keith s Mutt and Jeff routine By and large however the supporting roles seem underwritten or at least underrepresented in the finished film The overall failure of THE TWO JAKES is a pity because for once someone attempted a sequel that would expand and richen the themes of the original film and an original film that had serious intentions at that The only similar examples that spring to mind are THE GODFATHER II a definite success and THE EXORCIST II a stupendous failure THE TWO JAKES is decidedly not a ripoff of CHINATOWN It has genuine artistic intentions it s about something and wants to reach audiences in a way beyond the merely visceral From the title to the basic strings of the plot to the characters and their motivations Nicholson and Towne want us to think and feel Among other things THE TWO JAKES is about love loyalty the inescapable influences of the past and redemption Unfortunately the film just doesn t work While far from a disaster THE TWO JAKES is much too near a disappointment
0805,Exorcist III The,1990,The Phantom went into THE EXORCIST III with a bad taste in his mouth and although it may have had more to do with some strange Italian mineral water he had just drunk he thinks that part of the reason is the general state of horror films today Through no fault of his own a few nights ago he was forced to watch most of last year s indescribably bad THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and as the film plodded through scene after predictable scene of tedious violence and more close ups of Robert Englund s latex encased face than even his mother would appreciate let alone enjoy the Phantom considered the current state of the horror film How things had come from the suspense classics and psychological thrillers of years ago to this monstrosity this badly plotted affront to the name Phantom this latex nightmare is a mystery Either audiences have become stupider for there is no other adequate description of a film like Englund s PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or filmmakers believe that audiences have become stupider or there is simply no one left who can direct an intelligent horror film Consider the Phantom s most recent reviews which span just about a year s worth of horror films In a year s worth of horror films how many were good enough that anyone would want to see them once let alone again on video in years to come HENRY and for those phans of the Twilight Zone BRAIN DEAD The rest range from downright awful to predictable to well I know it sucked but it had great special effects Yet as he compiled this roll call of the mediocre it struck the Phantom that the best of the lot HENRY and BRAIN DEAD are both primarily psychological thrillers first and horror films second Although some graphic violence is depicted in each these two films achieve their effect through good direction good plotting good cinematography and just plain good story telling In years gone by even the Roger Corman Edgar Allen Poe quickies had some measure of intelligence to them whether because of the severe restrictions placed on the display of graphic violence or the infancy of film effects and makeup techniques or because latex hadn t yet been invented horror films had to be designed to scare their audiences through subtle manipulations rather than through overt displays of blood and gore Of course the Phantom realizes that there were exceptions to this rule more than a few low budget gore fests were produced during the seventies but for the most part horror films made before the Jasonized eighties had a different look and feel to them and the successful ones were successful because they gave us credit for having imaginations and intelligence However good one thinks the HELLRAISER and EVIL DEAD series are one would be hard pressed to say that these films were very thoughtful or even more than superficially clever Alas it seems that even in the best of the most recent horror films phans have had to settle for style over substance and clever camera work over original plots and intelligent dialogue But what does any of this have to do with the subject of this review the latest EXORCIST sequel Just that while THE EXORCIST III isn t a classic horror film it is certainly a cut above the vast majority of sad excuses for horror films we ve seen recently Best of all it s a worthy successor to the original EXORCIST and it all but erases from one s mind its mind numbing predecessor though the Phantom must admit that he makes a special stop for it at his local Blockbusters whenever he really needs a good laugh The Phantom thinks that this makes for a nice ironic contrast with William Friedkin s 1973 classic the original EXORCIST Though THE EXORCIST may have been a lot of things subtle it was not But phans must keep in mind the time in which the film was released 1973 was very much different from 1990 as far as what an audience expected to see in a horror film in fact THE EXORCIST is one of the films that so changed our expectations that it spawned an entire sub genre the bogus Catholic theology genre of horror film of which this year s THE FIRST POWER is one very unfortunate example THE EXORCIST worked because it pulled out all the stops but times have changed and the Phantom has seen dozens too many horror films that make THE EXORCIST look like a Disney production Pea soup and gruesome special effects just don t cut it anymore and too many recent horror films that were technically excellent still failed to satisfy because they regularly sacrificed story character and dialogue to the all powerful god latex And so the Phantom was astonished to see that THE EXORCIST III forsakes almost entirely this false god and so succeeds in a way that few other recent horror films have The film is William Peter Blatty s official sequel to the original EXORCIST which was based on his novel of the same name and it too is based on one of Blatty s novels in this case Legion but this time Blatty himself directs from a script that he himself adapted That alone was enough to give the Phantom pause after all the last time a writer had directorial ambitions Clive Barker managed to waste David Cronenberg s startling performance and produce a very mediocre NIGHTBREED Before that Steven King imagined that MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE would satisfy those of his phans who up until that point had not been happy with the film adaptations of his novels The Phantom thanks heaven above that Rob Reiner and not King is directing the forthcoming MISERY since it was while watching MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE the Phantom discovered what the protagonist of MISERY must have felt like when asked if would like to see MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE again the Phantom always responds I d rather be in hell with my back broken But Blatty seems to have decided that in EXORCIST II THE HERETIC he had a safety net no matter how bad EXORCIST III turned out it couldn t even approach the sheer awfulness of its most recent predecessor And so he set out to make a traditional horror film one that recalls THE OMEN or THE HAUNTING more than it does THE EXORCIST and one that at times feels more like a play than a film It is a film in which people act actually act not just stand around and say things like It s probably the storm I m sure it s just the wind let me take a look in the basement and make sure and in which the characters speak in complete sentences The dialogue throughout the film is intelligent witty and interesting one really wants to listen to what the characters are saying and the dialogue itself contains countless clues to the mysteries of the film s plot And the film achieves its effects in precisely the way that made the great horror films of the past great through the use of psychological horror rather than through acres of latex and liters of blood In fact at one point in the film the Devil speaking through his latest instrument of death says that he has always enjoyed Shakespeare s works Given the structure and tone of much of the film it s easy to see why THE EXORCIST III is filled with what in different circumstances might be termed soliloquies Strange for a film made in the past few years and stranger still for a horror film And strangest of all although this is one of the Phantom s most hated forms of exposition since he feels it is entirely inappropriate in a visual medium that affords the artist so much freedom the Phantom found that he enjoyed Blatty s style and his script immensely The story is a simple one and so the Phantom will have to be careful not to give too much of it away The action takes place in the present day 15 years after Linda Blair gave her head turning performance and 15 years after the Devil killed Father Karras Phans will remember that the Devil was exorcised that day and Blatty reveals that he s been itching for revenge ever since the Devil that is though one could argue that Blatty s been itching for another success the people who have purchased his last novel have not been well legion This is the starting point for THE EXORCIST III George C Scott plays a detective who was a good friend of Father Karras and who now has the responsibility of solving a string of bizarre ritualistic murders that at least initially seem to proceed with no real pattern Each murder is more gruesome than the next though phans of bogus Catholic theology films will be glad to know that none tops the acme of these deaths the priest in THE FINAL CONFLICT the third OMEN film who was strung up wrapped in plastic and then set on fire as he swung suspended over a television studio and in time Scott comes to realize that he is dealing with something that is decidedly unnatural He is plagued by dreams first of Father Karras death as he tumbled down those sinister looking stairs then by visions of heaven in which the dead and soon to be dead mingle with angels playing big band music and with assorted NBA all stars no the Phantom is not making this up but it is just a dream you know and finally he discovers the link between what happened 15 years ago a series of murders by someone known as the Gemini killer that had been solved at about that time and the murders that are occurring all around him with astonishing regularity What that link is the Phantom will never divulge but he warns phans not to get their hopes up Blatty may be able to make the Devil believable but John Le Carre he is not If the Phantom has made this film sound like another FIRST POWER or perhaps another PRINCE OF DARKNESS then he s done it a grave injustice perhaps it s because so much of what is enjoyable about THE EXORCIST III has nothing to do with its rather shopworn plot Whereas THE FIRST POWER and PRINCE OF DARKNESS were exceptionally stupid and dim witted films respectively films that did not even come close to doing their subjects justice THE EXORCIST III delivers Although Blatty could have turned this into another special effects extravaganza he directs with a remarkably literate and restrained style The murders all take place off camera and yet because the characters describe them they turn out to be even more effective than the most heavy handed slash and trash scene Instead of seeing decapitations and disembowelments we hear about them something truly unique in these very illiterate yet overly literal days It is psychological horror at its very best we are scared not because of what we see but because of what we hear and imagine And still more remarkably the film has a very low SLC Quotient from the Phantom s Dictionary of Horror Film Reviewing Terms Spring Loaded Cat Quotient so named in honor of the technique Ridley Scott used to scare his audience in ALIEN The film has a spare feeling and most scenes have just two or three people in them in fact the film s most effective scenes are staged in a cell in which Scott listens to the Gemini killer discuss his work Not since HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER has a director attempted to get his audience inside the head of a psychopath and while John McNaughton was far more successful in his excellent HENRY Blatty utilizing some rather eccentric and compelling monologues comes close There are no profound surprises to be found in Blatty s plot and for a film that starts out with a rather interesting premise THE EXORCIST III ends in a very conventional way In fact the Phantom has heard rumors that the original version of the film did not end with an exorcism as the current version does and that the ending was mandated by nervous studio executives who didn t feel comfortable releasing a film called THE EXORCIST III if it didn t contain at least one exorcism These same meddlers might then also be responsible for the film s only scenes of blood and gore scenes which seem remarkably out of place given the tone of preceding 90 minutes The Phantom has not read Legion so he doesn t know whether or not an exorcism was featured in Blatty s original conception of the story But the film s ending is both disappointing and jarring worse than being simply a bad ending it seems entirely inappropriate But that is but a small quibble For the most part Blatty deserves nothing but praise for attempting to raise the genre from the black depths into which Jason Michael and Freddy have cast it Simply put THE EXORCIST III is a very enjoyable very compelling and very successful horror film See it phans it s even worth 7 50
0806,Exorcist III The,1990,THE EXORCIST III is the real sequel to what might have been the single most important horror movie since Boris Karloff portrayed Dracula The original EXORCIST shattered the bounds of what was acceptable gore and unfortunately spawned a generation of slasher films that were nothing but gore Released in 1973 it depicted a level of violence that I do not believe had ever been encountered before The sequel THE EXORCIST II THE HERETIC I think was so bad that it completely submarined the career of Linda Blair who When I saw the preview for E III in the theater several months back I heard several people say Three Was there a Two I don t remember II The lucky few The lucky few Now 17 years later we have a sequel Fifteen years have passed and some very disturbing murders are being committed There is none or very little of the shocking gore of the original or of the multitude of successful horror movies of the last decade The gore is minimalistic and the emphasis is on scaring the bejeezus out of the audience without tricks There is one scene where the camera is set up at the end of a hallway A series of miniscares and an earie soundtrack warns you that something is going to happen Something dreadful You know what will happen You know to who You know to who The demon has told you who is going to die You KNOW And yet when the moment comes I nearly bolted out of my chair A figure in a white flowing gown walks quickly across the hallway perfectly erect The scene is surreal The flowing robes and the fast soundtrack make the action seem like it is moving too fast but it is real time The figure has the murder weapon stretched out in front like an object of rapture There is never the scene of the murder No blood is spilled and yet the audience is truly terrified I highly recommend this movie for several reasons It is a return to the good old fashion psychological thriller a la ALIEN or PSYCHO with a good dose of horror thrown in for good measure It might be a good idea to see THE EXORCIST before you see this to refresh your mind as to some of the details The plot of the first movie is rather important Blatty s depiction of Satan is rather disturbing There is a quality there that is so human The demon has his points if you look just for an instant from his perspective Blatty allows the story to unfold slowly and terrifyingly There are long pauses in dialog and long speeches from major players in the plot The acting is wonderfull sic
0807,Darkman,1990,The first thing I d like to say is that Gene Siskel Roger Ebert and Rex Reed are all wrong This film sucks The premise that a man can change his face merely by changing the skin on top of it with no regard to any difference in the shape of his skull is hopeless If you feel like accepting this it would help if the scientist responsible for inventing this skin came across as intelligent rather than as a retard who grunts through the film without uttering a single piece of intelligible dialogue DISCLAIMER I have nothing against retards I just don t think they make believable scientists Add to this the fact that all of his skin reconstruction work is performed with materials salvaged from a completely annihilated laboratory reconstructed in a disused factory with no explanation as to who is paying the power bill If you feel like accepting all of this you must deal with a head villain capable of wiping out forty odd of a competitor s muscle men using only one gun and lacking any cover You must deal with the idea we cannot call it a fact that the fake skin alone is enough to fool numerous bad guys into believing that our hero is who he pretends to be faulty mannerisms and lack of knowledge notwithstanding I mean let s face it it s easy to fool us as we re willing to suspend our disbelief and every time he has assumed a new personality they merely used the actor who portrayed the role that he is assuming but when you are dealing with a person close up and you haven t suspended your disbelief you re going to note nervousness and fake skin And come on criminals are a suspicious lot anyway If you want to accept all of this I should tell you that the plot is essentially the same as that of ROBOCOP with the big corporate bad guy with his right hand man who destroy the hero only to have him come back to life and hunt them down I m not comparing this film to robocop as it lacks all the satire and intense pacing and genuine suspense of that film If you need to see this story again rent Robocop from a video store If you still want to see this film I can t help you But please go alone This is without a doubt the worst film I ve ever seen and I ve seen a lot of films
0808,Darkman,1990,Sam Raimi is a director who came from out of nowhere to become a major name in the horror film genre His film EVIL DEAD 1983 produced on a shoestring was nonetheless a very impressive debut He had a lot of novel variations on what was basically a zombie film Raimi s second film EVIL DEAD II 1987 proved to be a terrifically inventive horror film with an amazing array of weird twists and visual playing You have little idea watching EVIL DEAD II what is likely to happen next but you can be fairly sure it will further twist the horror film cliches into a knot With DARKMAN Raimi is taking on the comic book superhero film and trying to twist it the way he twisted the zombie film in his previous efforts With DARKMAN however Raimi is telling a more complex story than before and it shows up weaknesses in his story telling abilities In fact by making the short trip from horror fantasy to what is basically science fiction Raimi has managed to turn his greatest virtue into his greatest flaw What was good about the EVIL DEAD films particularly the sequel was the feeling that just about anything could happen That is the same feeling we get with DARKMAN but it is a fault As a fantasy the EVIL DEAD films take place in a world of the supernatural DARKMAN occurs in the world of the rational and it has a much more complex plot With a rational film you have the right to observe that something does not make sense Liam Neeson plays Dr Westlake a scientist working on synthetic flesh a la 1932 s DR X His girlfriend Julie Hastings played by Frances McDormand runs afoul of some particularly sadistic heavies and they horribly disfigure Westlake in an attempt to kill him To treat Westlake his doctors cut his pain sensors a standard procedure operation that leaves Westlake with great strength and also makes him just a little mentally unbalanced As his doctor Jenny Agutter in a cameo explains this is pretty generally what the operation does The first question to ask is why there are not a bunch of very strong people running around Even if as the doctor suggests the vast majority of people who have the operation do not survive wouldn t the few who do have the Darkman s strength Westlake disfigured then escapes and hides in sewers with perhaps more than just a slight tip of the hat to the 1943 PHANTOM OF THE OPERA Eventually he finds a place and stocks it with very advanced scientific equipment How does he find such a nice place that is just abandoned Where does he get the equipment Who knows He uses his synthetic flesh to make computer generated masks that are perfect replicas of people using only the information in a single photograph Bosh he could not possibly get all the information he needs from so few photographs When he puts on the mask he can look so much like the other person as to fool even close associates How does he get the right voice Assume the right stature Apparently after having built this laboratory with his own hands he suddenly discovers that all along his hands have been as badly destroyed as his face How could he do as much as he did without realizing the state of his hands The logic of DARKMAN is not just bad it is shockingly bad The technical credits are somewhat better The score by Danny Elfman is somewhat in his BATMAN style but stands fairly well on its own With his first real budget Raimi has managed a number of nice visual effects though at times he almost borders on being pretentious One such touch has Hastings watching the death of her lover First the background fades to a graveyard then her clothing fades to a black mourning dress A number of visual touches seem to borrow from ALTERED STATES But there are also surprising visual gaffes such as shots shown in mirror image with tell tale backwards lettering At one point we see a truck with a clown smile face on it destroyed and seconds later we see it miraculously undestroyed The tone of the film abruptly shifts to tongue in cheek toward the end damaging the feeling DARKMAN has been getting some very favorable comment from critics And I tried to turn my mind off and just enjoy the film But I have to say DARKMAN did not do very much for me I give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0809,Witches The,1990,We saw the last SNIFF Jim Henson movie over the weekend a marvelous movie called THE WITCHES THE WITCHES starts off in modern day Norway with some fabulous scenes of flight over the glaciers A grandmother tells her impressionable grandson all about witches and how to avoid them His parents are abruptly killed and his grandmother takes him home to England and then to a seaside resort for a little vacation The seaside resort is also the the meeting place for the annual witches convention The grandmother recognizes an old adversary and the grandson stumbles over a meeting of the witches annual meeting In this movie witches look much like regular women except that they wear wigs elaborate rubber masks and gloves When the meeting begins the witches let down their hair so to speak and a room of fairly normal looking women becomes a gaggle of bald crones As the Grand High Witch Angelica Houston is given truly hideous makeup in this scene She s a wonderful presence in the film but she speaks with a really awful Germanic accent That accent was one of the few missteps in the film I think the ending was a slight misstep too but if Dahl wrote the ending that way I m not going to complain too much Aside from the witch makeup another wonderful bit of makeup effects occur when people are turned into mice an occurrence which happens throughout this movie When the grandson and a friend of his are turned into mice the camera looks at the world from their point of view about 1 4 inch off the ground I don t want to give too much away about this marvelous and inventive film Go see it and take the kids unless they are sensitive or easily frightened This was X posted to sf lovers because I think THE WITCHES is currently the strongest contender for the dramatic presentation Hugo next year It completely blows BACK TO THE FUTURE III out of the water
0810,Witches The,1990,Capsule review Jim Henson s last film is a charming modern fairy tale of a boy foiling a plot by the witches of England It captures some of the fun horror of traditional fairy tales Unfortunately it loses some of its inspiration about mid film The story would be ideally suited to animation and doing it in live action is an impressive if not altogether necessary feat Rating low 2 The perfect medium for showing imaginative images visually is animation With animation if you can visualize it you can put it on a screen 1973 s FANTASTIC PLANET while lacking in story values may well be the most visually imaginative science fiction film ever made Unfortunately for animated fantasy STAR WARS came out four years later and showed that imaginative live action was coming of age and animated fantasy became a sideshow Only the Japanese seem to recognize the possibilities of animation as a medium for fantasy and even in Japan fantastic animation is falling short of the real potential of the medium In the United States and Europe audiences want live action even if it is at the expense of imagination Films such as BATMAN and DICK TRACY are trying to impress the world with how well they can overcome problems that would not even arise with animation DICK TRACY was able to make some expensive boxoffice stars really look much like the comic strip characters BATMAN was less successful visually in making Jack Nicholson look like the Joker Both of these films could have had better stories and looked absolutely perfect had they been animated but they would have died at the boxoffice Audiences really want live action and are quite willing to sacrifice story values and imagination for the thrill of seeing things done in live action THE WITCHES is a fine new live action fantasy film that almost matches in imagination and charm what Walt Disney was able to do with animation back in the 1940s Fairy tales are not all sweetness and fun and they are not just for children Most fairy tales are horror stories told on a level that all ages can appreciate them And that is just what THE WITCHES is From the very beginning this film lays down some blood curdling folklore about witches Some of it is really the stuff paranoia is made of Witches can live right next door they smell children from great distances they have no toes Take note those of you who feel children must be protected from the sort of scary stories that children have been raised on from time immemorial The stories are told to young Luke played by Jasen Fisher by his Norwegian grandmother played by Swedish actor director Mai Zettering and it is a good thing she told him He shortly has to fight a convocation of the witches of England in their plot to turn all English children into mice And shortly is how he has to fight them since he is one of the first two children turned into mice Jim Henson used his Muppet technology to portray the mouse Luke when he does something non mouselike When a trained mouse can be used it is The problem there is that the Muppet mouse has a cute face that the real mouse apparently found very difficult to mimic The combining of realistic mouse movements with a humanlike personality for the mouse would be of course much simpler for Disney to do in animation than it was for Henson to do in live action and the result would have been much more successful The makeup for the witches is similarly nicely executed Anjelica Huston s Grand High Witch makeup fails to convince totally that this is really the face of a living being but it is well detailed THE WITCHES is and is likely to remain Nicholas Roeg s only children s film He claims he made it for his own newly born child Allan Scott s script based on the novel by Roald Dahl raises some gooseflesh early on but loses much of its power to chill once Luke is a cute mouse and the story concentrates more on his mission than on the horror of the witches Scott also manages to throw in some double entendres clearly not intended for the younger audience In smaller roles there is Rowan Atkinson television s Black Adder as a hotel manager clearly of the Basil Fawlty style Bill Peterson Dickie Bird in Bill Forsyte s COMFORT AND JOY plays the father of a mouse who once was a gluttonous child It would be unfair to down rate this film because it is not doing anything to advance animated film The film as it stands is charming and works at least generally in live action It is a nice fantasy and deserves some credit for not aiming specifically at a youth or teenage market It is just a decent fantasy film that is there for whatever audience it finds I rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0811,Ghost,1990,No you will not believe in ghosts after seeing GHOST unless you were predisposed to believe in them already But you will see a movie that is a wonderful blend of love story thriller and comedy And yes I think it worked The plot is simple though it has a few interesting twists Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore move into a big old loft apartment Swayze is in finance at a bank and Moore is a sculptor Swayze is murdered and his ghost runs into the movie While it appears to be a random killing at first the ghost learns that one of his co workers was out to get some computer security codes and that he may now be out to get Moore In order to reach Moore he finds Whoopi Goldberg a spiritualist The movie is at its best when it plays with people s beliefs about ghosts and the afterlife Goldberg is a charlatan until Swayze finds her and she isn t sure what to do with him Moore desperately wants to believe that Goldberg has contacted Swayze but the evidence is stacked against her And Swayze wants to reach Moore in order to save her life but he can t contact her directly since he s a ghost This is not an actors movie Whoopi Goldberg is on hand playing her classic smart mouthed street wise broad with an attitude and she s a hoot Both Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are ernest adorable and moving A character actor who played one of the patients in Cuckoo s Nest and one of Salieri s servants in Amadeus gives a great performance of a ghost trapped in the New York subway The biggest flaw in this movie is the editing Many scenes run on too long The director and film editor should have shaven about 10 20 minutes from the movie and would have made a better tighter movie
0812,Air America,1990,Billy Covington a young helicopter pilot who does traffic reports loses his pilot s license because of well stunt flying He s not out of work for long though a recruiter for Air America convinces him that excitement and money are just a half world away in beautiful Laos Not having anything better to do and finding the thought of exotica fairly enticing Billy ships out and arrives at Air America s headquarters for Laos A word now about Air America 1968 style The slogan was Anything anywhere any time Or something similar And that s what Air America could get for you if you were a friendly in the Vietnam war As you probably know but just in case you didn t Air America was a civilian airline run by your friends the CIA And it was the largest airline in the world what with branches in South America and in most trouble spots in the world Gene Ryack Mel Gibson is one of the Air America pilots in Laos he breaks Billy in and shows him the ropes They talk they fly they get shot at they walk through jungles etc Sounds like a typical buddy movie doesn t it It s not In a buddy movie two characters of usually dissimilar backgrounds and lifestyles and mores learn Important Lessons from each other That doesn t happen here because the two don t interact much on that level and don t really go through important changes That hints at the problem with this movie the characters don t move much from their original positions Where s the conflict that causes a wrenching moral dilemma That is the basis for drama and it s just not here in sufficient quantity As a matter of fact this film feels disjointed as if too much cut and paste occurred in a dark room If you re interested in finding out how and why this movie got made read the article in this month s PREMIERE magazine the one with Nicholson on the cover Lots of work lots of discomfort including typhoons and earthquakes and lots of thought went into this movie but something happened during its transition from an idea to a reality Chop chop let s cut out the love interest Chop chop don t show so much of Gene s home life Chop chop there s too much talk and not enough action The producer realized that a summer blockbuster has to appeal to 15 year old boys Isn t there some sort of law against taking an adult film and teenaging it Look at the lovely structure for this film a world weary distrusting pilot works for the CIA and learns to watch out for his family ignoring the compromises he has to make every day A young pilot who stands on principle begins working for the CIA and learns that not everything is clearly right or wrong The young pilot pulls the world weary pilot into a contest where the compromises are unacceptable but the consequences to his family are too threatening That would make a good movie don t you think Now How can we screw it up Hmmm let s see We ll make the world weary pilot a real cool cookie who never worries about safety or thinks about the compromises he makes And let s make the young pilot a hot head who never learns how to cool it Okay now for the antagonist He should be a greedy guy and let s not spend much time on him As a result of this type of thinking we have main characters who only marginally influence each other and not even in a believable way The main crisis is such a forced and even trite situation that not even the main characters seem to take it seriously There s no real danger no real threat and no real growth Gibson is extremely restrained in this role It s as if he were wrapping a cloak around himself in preparation for becoming Hamlet his next role His restraint has the curious effect of making his character seem wooden He s never been worse than in this movie The script at least the script as we hear it doesn t give him much to say but he has always risen way above any role he has played Maybe the problem is with excessive exposition you can hear him reading the words Or maybe he was holding back maintaining a reserve for Zeffirelli his next director Robert Downey Jr does well enough but his character was not very interesting He s managed a couple of nice moments and he interacts well with the other cast members but that s about it Apparently the filming which was done in Thailand was quite a strain on everyone The monsoons couldn t have been very pleasant And they really did have a 6 1 earthquake plus aftershocks The entire cast and crew had to suffer through a myriad of inoculations as well as worry about snakes and various nasty critters including Siamese baby pigs Really They re carrying some bizarre fatal disease Would I kid you Gibson s usual stuntman either wasn t available or left part way through the film I m not sure which A myriad of personality clashes tangled matters even further Altogether a difficult prospect to film Some directors can profit very handsomely by filming in a location that increases stress the conflict between characters is heightened and the location itself becomes part of the conflict However this director didn t focus the discomfort Instead he tried to keep things light and comedic He tempered the conflict He was wrong and we re the ones who pay
0814,Darkman,1990,When I first entered the theater I had somewhat mediocre expectations for the film DARKMAN The trailers looked good but I really didn t know much about the director I have never seen any of the EVIL DEAD movies but when I left the theater I was glad I took a chance on seeing this excellent movie The story involves a scientist Dr Peyton Westlake Liam Neeson who is working on an invention that will create realistic synthetic skin His girlfriend Julie Hastings Frances McDormand who works for the District Attorney s office uncovers a document revealing some illegal transactions between Trask Industries and Robert Durant Larry Drake One night when Westlake is on the brink of perfecting his invention Durant and his hoods break into Peyton s lab in search of the document After roughing up Westlake they find the document Durant s henchmen dunk Westlake s hands and face into a vat of acid afterward they blow up his lab Julie arriving home after work sees this explosion and assumes Peyton is dead Later we find out that Peyton wasn t killed instead he was taken to the Hospital Burn Unit with severe burns over 40 of his body the worst being on his face and hands After Peyton regains consciousness he escapes from the hospital and becomes DARKMAN DARKMAN has the ability by using his invention to assume the identity of anyone he chooses simply by using their photograph He also possesses incredible strength and no longer has the capability of feeling any physical pain due to an operation that was performed in the hospital The visual effects in this film were quite good I also enjoyed the directorial style of Sam Raimi The performances of the actors were also very good especially Liam Neeson The latest trend in films today is making movies about comic heroes We have been treated to BATMAN and DICK TRACY CBS has a television series called THE FLASH due for its fall season and the films CAPTAIN AMERICA SPIDERMAN and the BATMAN sequel are also in the planning stages DARKMAN had the look of a comic book that BATMAN was missing and DICK TRACY never achieved So the next time a stranger bumps into you on the street or your loved one doesn t seem to be themselves You might want to ask yourself is it really them or could it be DARKMAN I give this film a rating of 2
0815,Yume,1990,DREAMS is the first film by Akira Kurosawa since RAN was released in 1986 It is composed of eight pieces each individually titled and each describing an incident seemingly taken from a larger story All of them of are beautifully filmed with striking occasionally surreal imagery and a minimum of conversation Don t wait for this film to hit videotape cropping the pictures will ruin many carefully composed scenes There is no plot to this film The individual scenes do suggest stories although they come sometimes from the beginning middle or end of the stories which contain them The cinematography is consistently astonishing I saw a PBS special on Kurosawa recently which showed him painting watercolor visions for what would become the film KAGEMUSHA In DREAMS he also seems to have carefully constructed his images I can think of a half dozen individual stills which I would like posters of The film is relentlessly visual with long stretches containing no dialogue Like most Kurosawa movies the pacing is somewhat slow by American standards Scenes are built very carefully In Blizzard for instance he waits until we experience the same exhaustion that the characters on screen are going through before advancing the story along The short length of each segment however prevents the film from lagging at least until the final three scenes The final scenes do take the film down some as they contain long speeches about the evils of radiation and industrial civilisation I may be reacting in part to my own negative opinion of the Split wood not atoms message imposed on these scenes but I feel that the long speeches absent from any of the other scenes disrupt the visual storytelling process During the afore mentioned PBS special Kurosawa says that he distrusts films that carry meanings As he put it Meaning is easy but style that is very difficult He seems to have forgotten this sentiment midway through this picture and employs a troubling narrative style to present his views This is a jarring contrast to the other pieces The Tunnel for example delivers a very strong and complex message without any exposition at all Even these scenes are beautifully made however In particular the last scene which contains no surreal photography although the setting is sadly all too unreal is a wonderful celebration of nature and life This film left me deeply moved and in awe at Kurosawa s ability to compose images The movie may be difficult to find In NYC it is playing at only one theatre the 57th St Playhouse and I don t think it has been released very widely It is worth the effort however so don t pass up a probably brief chance to see this film in a theatre
0816,Wild at Heart,1990,I walked into David Lynch s BLUE VELVET without much in the way of forewarning or familiarity with Lynch s earlier films and had my head totally twisted around for the better part of a week as a result So when I went to see his latest WILD AT HEART I was better prepared This time I was only mildly confused and distressed WILD AT HEART concerns the adventures of two dedicated lovers Lula and Sailor who are on the run from Lula s mom a woman who is roughly similar to the Wicked Witch of the West and is portrayed very specifically as such Mom is a truly evil character made no less so by the mind shattering guilt she feels over her crimes but nothing can stand in the way of Lula s and Sailor s love If this sounds vaguely like THE PRINCESS BRIDE you know true love will always find a way well it is if you can imagine THE PRINCESS BRIDE with very graphic and moderately imaginative sex EXTREMELY graphic violence a vision of human beings that does not exclude their bodily functions villains so evil that they literally invoke a sense of fear and revulsion a large supporting cast of psychoes freaks and weirdos some dangerous some not and a general air of sleaze corruption and kitsch If this sounds strange it is but Lynch fans understand if you don t understand watch out Like BLUE VELVET being asked the question Is this a good movie causes confusion Some people will like it some people will hate it but everyone will admit that it is DIFFERENT Next question Did I like it Well there were certainly things to like Lynch has a way with visual imagery and his use of flame as a recurring image in this film is riveting Laura Dern as Lula is a stunning heartbreaker and Nicholas Cage as Sailor is a sympathetic character and the VILLAINS MY GOD Darth Vader is a silly fantasy these people are sick cruel as snakes and vividly REAL not merely remorseless but actually amused by inflicting pain and wreaking destruction In this context William Dafoe gets to play a character about as far removed from JC as possible Dafoe has been somewhat typecast as a saintly type I wonder if Lynch found it amusing to play him against that and Isobella Rosellini gets a small part in which she shows that even the sleaziest style cannot hide what a knockout she is Lynch also has a way of generating passions too a sort of way of getting underneath the characters and the audience s skin that I m not sure if I care for or not it s vivid but seems a little like voyeurism at times I remember a colleague saying how unreal it was when at the end of a TV show all the characters would be sitting around chatting after being through enormous turmoil as if nothing had happened when in reality they d be carrying the weight of the events for years or the rest of their lives In Lynch s universe that s what happens and we see into the character s deepest nightmares as in Lula s heartbreaking memory of a childhood assault There were things to outright dislike though The film tended to drag a little and it could ve stood to have had a few scenes cut that detracted from its dramatic build particularly the little side stories about one psycho or another And sometimes it goes too campy also undermining its build and Lynch s preoccupation with weirdness sometimes goes beyond his unusual sense of aesthetics into something like affectation too self consciously and traditionally avante garde as if he is throwing these things out just to confound the sort of film analysts who like to reduce stories to pointless meanderings about meanings and symbology Granted they re more than fair game but it also seems somewhat dishonest like playing games with the viewer So as far as recommendations go you pays your money and you takes your chances There s only one recommendation I would make Don t take the kids or someone who is squeamish
0817,Life Is Cheap... But Toilet Paper Is Expensive,1990,Synopsis A Japanese Chinese American cowboy actually a stable boy is sent to Hong Kong as a courier to deliver a briefcase to a gangster boss There he falls in love with the gangster s mistress and experiences the sleazy side of Hong Kong A rather unsympathetic look at Chinese culture done with deadpan humor However the humor fails to rescue the weak plot a very forgettable film Released with a self issued A rating Hong Kong Cantonese and English subtitled for US distribution color 1990 89 minutes Before discussing specific details of the film it is worth noting that this film is making history by being the first film released with a self designated A adult rating after receiving an X rating from the MPAA The newspaper ads for the film contain the following note A This film contains adult themes or images that may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age following in small print This film does not carry a rating issued by the MPAA Many leading filmmakers believe the MPAA s current rating system promotes censorship and does not serve the best interests of the viewing public If you can t convince the MPAA to adopt an A rating this case shows that you can easily go around them with a self rating system This is the latest film from Wayne Wang whose previous films include CHAN IS MISSING and EAT A BOWL OF TEA Here Wang returns to his native Hong Kong he is a U S citizen resident to create a low budget film that appears to be a personal statement and a critical sarcastic statement at that about Hong Kong and Chinese culture The story concerns a Japanese Chinese American a stable boy at a racetrack in the San Francisco area who is hired to be a courier and deliver a briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist to a Hong Kong gangster boss When he tries to deliver the briefcase the boss is sick or away can t tell which so he decides to see Hong Kong while he waits Our hero goes sightseeing where he meets some very strange characters Then he is invited to a party at the gangster s house where the gangster announces the planned wedding of his beautiful daughter There is a funny scene where the daughter talks about astrology and the stars bringing them together while her groom explains that he is a Ph D anthropologist studying the history of the Chinese workers who built the railroads in America by digging up the fishbones they dropped along the way The courier who is it seems a man with no name as in the famous Italian westerns of years ago goes sightseeing again Two thieves steal the briefcase from him and the story continues from there Although the film has some deadpan black humor in it there isn t enough to make up for the very weak plot and other faults It is clearly a low budget film there is a long chase scene filmed using a shoulder mounted camera that is so shaky you can t stand to watch it The style of the film is similar to a documentary talking heads speaking directly to the camera with added narration from the hero The result is a disjointed nearly incoherent way of developing the plot The film is likely to offend many viewers There are violent scenes including one where live ducks are hung up and their throats slit The camera lingers on them as they bleed and die clearly this film is not for the squeamish As for the A X rating there is no explicit sex in the movie Rather the film is aimed lower at excretory processes rather than sexual Frankly after seeing the movie I thought it should have a self rating of GR for gross out or D for disgusting The grossness is apparently deliberate as the Director uses it to criticize the concept of saving face Having a taste for unusual offbeat movies I am willing to put up with some poor taste elements in a film if the film is otherwise entertaining However the poor taste overwhelms what little humor there is in this film and I don t recommend it Distribution In its initial US release the film is currently showing at two theaters in the local San Francisco area
0818,Metropolitan,1990,Capsule review An outsider gets involved with the tinder of the vanities a clique of young chic semi intellectuals who talk like the ATLANTIC MONTHLY but whose lives are just as mis managed as anyone else s Walt Stillman s dialogue is the main reason to see METROPOLITAN Rating 1 There is a separate sort of film I think you would have to call the dialogue film It is a concept parallel to that of the special effects film A dialogue film is built around and shows off its dialogue the way a special effects film is built around and shows off its visual effects While films one would classify as dialogue films have been more common in Europe than in the United States obvious American dialogue films include RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN THE BIG CHILL and especially MY DINNER WITH ANDRE METROPOLITAN has marginally more plot than the former three films but it probably still qualifies In METROPOLITAN Tom Townsend played by Edward Clements gets politely kidnapped to a debutante party populated by young wealthy sophisticated intellectuals and pseudo intellectuals They call themselves the SFRP Sally Fowler Rat Pack and representatives of the UHB Urban Haute Bourgeoisie Tom s background is not quite so haute as the others but he can talk the talk and with a little help from the others he can walk the walk in a second hand tuxedo But it is talking the talk that is the main thing and while on an intellectual level Tom has objections to this young tinder of the vanities Tom believes himself to be a Fourier socialist he nonetheless finds himself repeatedly drawn to their company The plot of METROPOLITAN is only very slight as one of the quieter members of the rat pack a literature fan named Audrey Rouget played by Carolyn Farina takes a liking to Tom though Tom is still in love with former girlfriend Serena Slocum Elizabeth Thompson But this film s fine point is not so much the plot as its view of this young aristocracy and the often funny and always engrossing dialogue Writing credit for the dialogue as well as most of the rest of the credit goes to writer director producer Walt Stillman who according to VARIETY sold his Manhattan apartment to help finance the film He probably will not get rich making films like METROPOLITAN but he should be able to get another apartment I rate this a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0819,Postcards from the Edge,1990,Capsule review Petulant semi autobiographical comedy written by Carrie Fisher about her relationship with her mother and the world in general There are a couple of nice dramatic scenes but not enough to salvage this self pitying story Rating high 0 Life can be tough It really is not very easy growing up in Hollywood with no father and a famous movie star mother who wants to run your life Then there are all sorts of Hollywood types of people and probably none of them are looking out for your best interests or treat you as gently as you think they should That is the sad premise of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE with a screenplay by Carrie Fisher based on her semi autobiographical novel of the same name Suzanne Vale played by Meryl Streep is a second rate actress who can get roles in only third rate films She seems invariably to play women of action committed to some cause but she herself is committed to nothing She consoles herself with cocaine which makes her even harder to work with Then she takes the drugs a bit too far and ends up in the custody of her singer actress mother Doris Mann played by Shirley MacLaine a show business legend but just as dependent on alcohol and drugs as her daughter This all would be pretty bleak if not for Vale s quick wit which at times is undeniably funny and POSTCARDS laconic view of the nothing is as it seems world of Hollywood filmmaking The sarcastic wordplay among two and occasionally three generations of women from one family is perhaps the only thing preventing POSTCARDS from being a complete melodrama like MOMMY DEAREST It is a real pity that Fisher and Debbie Reynolds did not play the characters who were essentially themselves It would have added some authenticity to the roles Fisher would have been more believable as an actress cast in the sort of film in which looks are the most important thing and acting talent is optional Streep would not have been cast in such a film regardless of her talent because she does not have the looks that women in these films have On the other hand had Fisher and Reynolds starred POSTCARDS would have been criticized for where it does fictionalize Some courage points should be awarded to both Streep and MacLaine for being willing to appear without make up each in one scene Streep without make up looks just very plain how MacLaine looks without make up is something of a shock and probably is going to be remembered The scene however is essential to the film and gives it the only moments where it really says something of real interest MacLaine s make up is symbolic of all the sham and pretense of the Hollywood system but it cannot be stripped away without stripping away the dignity Much of the value of the film is dependent on MacLaine being willing to play this scene With the exception of one or two small powerful moments POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE is mostly a thin comedy drama I rate it a high 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0820,Hardware,1990,The Phantom has always thought of bad films as diseases In order to survive them one must either immunize oneself beforehand or find an antidote afterwards This week the Phantom plans to do both as the film to which he was just subjected was so indescribably bad so laughably awful so unrelentingly stupid that neither immunization nor antidote alone will suffice Fortunately for his sanity he rented THE GODFATHER earlier this week so he went into HARDWARE knowing that no matter how bad it was he would still be able to walk out of the auditorium with fond memories of an excellent film even if it wasn t the film he had just seen Though he didn t think that such precautions would be necessary with the subject of this review Believing that good previews good commercials and what seemed to be raves from Wes Craven Clive Barker and Fangoria magazine prominently displayed in the full page New York Times ad for the film portended a good new horror film he didn t think twice about recommending it to two of his like minded friends After all while he would never assume that there was anyone else who would enjoy watching say THE FIRST POWER with him here was a film that might even be in the same class as HELLRAISER or perhaps ALIEN Surely even if it wasn t quite up to that level it would at the very least be entertaining or gory or something Well no Instead the Phantom found that even the aura of THE GODFATHER couldn t save him instead he ll have to find an antidote this evening in order to rid his system of the poisonously bad trash he had just seen One obvious antidote to HARDWARE is ALIEN one of the dozen films that HARDWARE either pays homage to or rips off depending on how charitable one wants to be Another possible antidote would be THE ROAD WARRIOR or HELLRAISER or DEMON SEED for there are bits and pieces of all of these films scattered throughout the post apocalyptic cinematic wasteland that is HARDWARE HARDWARE is a recipe film which is a little different than a high concept film To make a recipe film you first line up all your ingredients which in this case would be ALIEN DEMON SEED THE ROAD WARRIOR MAX HEADROOM and HELLRAISER Then you add a half cup of one 20 minutes of another a few tablespoons of this and a pinch just a pinch mind you of imagination Stir thoroughly until the ingredients mix just well enough to avoid litigation you don t want the lawyers to see whole chunks of say ALIEN floating about in your stew The result Something that s saleable and marketable but which leaves its diners wondering what it was that got them to try even a spoonful let alone consume all 90 minutes of it Since the Phantom is having a sale on similes this week let s try one more HARDWARE is a camel of a film Like THE FIRST POWER it becomes obvious after only 10 or 15 minutes that the film was not so much imagined or created but constructed and packaged The Phantom made the mistake in his last review of wondering whether horror films were returning to their roots whether films like THE EXORCIST III marked the return of the intelligent horror film and an end to the mind numbing kill by the numbers sequel fests and poorly plotted and scripted turkeys that have plagued horror phans for years now But HARDWARE is as unlike THE EXORCIST III as it is like THE FIRST POWER It is a film that proves that for every talented British horror writer and filmmaker like Clive Barker there must be at least as many untalented hacks who are capable only of the poorest sort of plagiarism Or worse are capable only of producing something like HARDWARE Now that he s gotten that out of his system the Phantom will attempt to explain HARDWARE s lame brained plot There is no way to spoil a film like HARDWARE as that implies that there might be surprises to be given away or unique plot twists or special effects that might be ruined should audiences find out about them before seeing the film Too the Phantom would like to think that anyone who sees HARDWARE after reading his review must be a bit of a masochist so perhaps such a person would enjoy having the film s few plot twists revealed so that he or she may be as fully miserable as possible while watching it As the film began the Phantom suffered a brief TOTAL RECALL flashback for the film seemed to be set on Verhoeven s Mars sans the fake looking Martian colony and the shoddy optical printing But that bit of prescience should have alerted the Phantom to the horrors yet to unfold he should have heeded his sixth sense and ducked into DARKMAN next door Instead he stayed to find out what this new twist on THE ROAD WARRIOR might be like and found to his dismay that it was no twist at all it was more like a cut rate wholesale transplantation of about 15 minutes of that fine film We see the lone man walking through a desert we see the ruins of a post apocalyptic world around him we see the remains of civilization going about their miserable and dirty business we even see the curious mixing of the old and the very new that was strikingly original when we first saw it in BRAZIL and MAX HEADROOM some years ago but which by now is little more than another science fiction cliche But what we don t see is anything even remotely connected with the rest of the film with the exception of an old junked robot that the lone man finds buried in the desert This robot is the star of the second half of the film but as it is found only minutes into the first half the director spends the remaining 43 minutes in the post apocalyptic city and surrounding areas A travelogue it is not and neither George Miller nor Mel Gibson have anything to fear We meet the protagonist We meet his girlfriend The action shifts to the girlfriend s apartment where she works as an artist who assembles junk mostly scrap metal as sculpture The protagonist brings the robot s head to the girlfriend as a Christmas present and she duly incorporates it into her art But soon it turns out that the robot was a Mark 13 military robot a droid whose prime directive is to kill people and who has an amazingly strong survival instinct Uh oh The Phantom got good and worried at this point and began to keep his eyes peeled for the sudden appearance of Spring Loaded Cats blue fog pods and little crab like things that attach themselves to people s faces Alas all he found was fog some of it blue and some of it clouding whatever limited intelligence and originality the film had so far displayed Shortly after revealing the robot s origins in a scene reminiscent of THE EVIL DEAD the robot begins to assemble itself much like Frank did in the attic in HELLRAISER incorporating lots of scary looking hardware like buzz saws drills and anything else that was handy And as this happens the film just as quickly reassembles itself shifting none too nimbly from ROAD WARRIOR mode to ALIEN mode It was at this point that the Phantom put his hands to his ears so that he wouldn t have to listen to the sounds of breaking glass as logic and sensibility jumped out the window He did however hear their screams as they plummeted to certain deaths Now that the robot has assembled itself well it must be time to kill people Well no Of course one would think that a military robot programmed to kill having rebuilt itself out of cables and aluminum siding and can openers and whatever else happened to be lying around and having been left alone in an apartment with a defenseless girl would do the only logical thing kill her But of course that couldn t happen as both logic and sensibility were by then being rushed to the hospital where doctors would labor fruitlessly over them for another 40 minutes Instead we are treated to an extremely bad homage to the 1977 horror classic DEMON SEED The robot stalks the girl very slowly and looking very much like five poorly skilled and underpaid technicians were operating it and threatens her repeatedly with a drill bit that looks quite a lot like well the Phantom is sure you get the picture It does kill someone of course and eventually other people show up and try to kill it In between the apartment s lights flash on and off circuits short circuit endlessly hidden strobe lights are employed and the audience is entertained with simulations of the robot s vision that were taken from the same kitchen cupboard that holds PREDATOR and WOLFEN Finally the film winds down and in its last 15 minutes stirs in a few tablespoons each of the endings to BLADE RUNNER ALIEN and THE WIZARD OF OZ Really There s also a nice reverse homage to WAIT UNTIL DARK along the way but that one brief scene is the only glimmer of intelligence in a film that is otherwise as intellectually arid as the post apocalyptic wasteland in which it is set It has been a long time since the Phantom was so disappointed with a film so misled by its advertising and so saddened by the terrible waste of not just one or two but dozens of the good ideas clever and suspenseful scenes and special effects that have until now brightened and enlivened the horror genre There is quite literally no reason to see this film even on video In his review of THE EXORCIST III the Phantom remarked that it was even worth 7 50 the extortionate price of a movie ticket in New York City Well phans HARDWARE isn t even worth a 99 cent special at Blockbusters It is redeemed only because it makes nearly every other horror film look good in comparison and because it reminds everyone who sees it of the dozens of excellent horror films from which it labors so hard to steal
0821,Hardware,1990,Regarding the newly released movie HARDWARE my recommendation is don t waste your money The first half of the movie is quite boring as the movie does not go anywhere It has some visual artsy stuff but is sorely lacking in plot The second half is filled with hack and slash As far as a horror type movie the last part is yes violent But the characters were flat and the setting world situation was poorly developed Apparently USNews probably USA TODAY moderator gave it 3 stars on what scale I don t know but probably 4 or 5 and as one person commented sarcasticly on leaving the theater They were a little generous For my critique and trashing see below but be warned I may give away part of the story Basic summary The robot is dug up out in the desert and brought back to I think New York where this sculptor uses its head in a piece of work A scrap dealer is investigating the nature of the robot and finds it is the government s latest killing machine But about this time the completely dismembered robot starts to piece itself together i e it hands and such move around by themselves and repair the robot including animated cables Once this is done it goes on a killing spree in the sculptor s apartment killing anything and everything And coming back from being fire bombed cut in half and tossed out the window All in all most of the characters die Trashing The world is mostly desert and hot due to an apparent nuclear war possible a small one if there is such and the city is flooded and thus motorboats are taxis But despite the world disaster the American society still exists including the President and congress And not only do they have radio but a number of TV channels including heavy metal music videos Most of the people are struggling to survive and the government wants to institute population controls when it seems they would need people unless this is to control the spread of mutant genes but this is never made apparent The robot itself is suppose to be a great killing machine with six primary limbs weapons including chainsaw claws a drill and a strong poison delivered through 6 long needles However it has an Achilles heel of being designed for the desert moisture can affect its computer system Well for the latest in killing ability it has no projectile weapons of any sort and its vision is via infra red But its programming does not allow it to distinguish between the hot oven and a person The absurdity goes every further when the main character escapes the robot by crawling in the refrigerator but doesn t shut the door Her skin temperature could not cool down to the same temp as the inside of the fridge in a matter of seconds Her body heat would really stand out in front of that back ground Those are some of the major things that disturbed me but the movie was filled with many other silly things Like the lady couldn t work her own computer system to override the emergency door lock A security officer being sliced in half by the apartment doors which used pistons to shut them And more Basically there was no plot and I kept wondering where this was going After the beginning scenes which looked somewhat promising I realized that it wasn t going anywhere If you want a violent movie there are better ones as this one did not contain that much
0822,GoodFellas,1990,Back in the 1930s Warner Brothers made a reputation for themselves making gangster films That was the heyday of Cagney Raft Robinson and Bogart But I don t remember them ever making a gangster film as realistic as their current GOODFELLAS First of all GOODFELLAS is based on a true story It is in fact based on the memoir WISE GUY by Nicholas Pileggi who co wrote the screenplay with the film s director Martin Scorsese And the film is structured like a memoir It is long for a film 146 minutes and is mostly episodic with the episodes being somewhat related Dramatically it is not structured like SCARFACE with a beginning a middle and a satisfying ending Instead it is structured like a documentary but for one puzzling exception It starts during an incident in 1970 then in a flashback as if reminiscing at that point tells of Henry Hill s career in crime since 1955 returns to the 1970 incident and continues the story still in recollection style until about 1980 What makes it even more puzzling is that the 1970 incident while moderately important is not a pivotal point in the story This is the story of Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta a gangster of Italian Irish descent Hill is part of a small group of crooks and killers that is sort of a satellite of the Mafia Only those of pure Italian descent may actually be part of the Mafia Hill started at age 13 parking cars and running errands for a local gangster He loves the work and the respect and feat it brings him from the neighborhood From there one thing leads to another as he hijacks trucks and steals shipments at nearby Idlewild Kennedy Airport Eventually he is involved in a six million dollar theft in murder and in cocaine What looks like an enjoyable life early on gets more and more serious and nightmarish We see life in organized crime and in the social world surrounding crime There is loving attention paid to Italian food through most of the film Scorsese has the texture of the criminal very believably presented It is clear that life gets more serious for Hill as time progresses but Liotta s looks change very little in the course of the film His face is not very expressive and we have a hard time knowing how he feels at times Jimmy Conway played by Robert DeNiro is more expressive and does seem to change as time goes by It is unfortunate that DeNiro accepts top billing since he certainly had less than half the screen time that Liotta has DeNiro and Paul Sorvino as Paully Cicero play Hill s two bosses and mentors in crime Rounding out the topliners are Joe Pesci as the volatile gangster Tommy DeVito His performance is likely to be the one best remembered from the film One comes out of GOODFELLAS not feeling greatly entertained but with the feeling that you have seen an authentic view of modern crime I rate it 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0823,Rosalie Goes Shopping,1989,Yesterday I went and saw this film hoping to find something wonderful like BAGDAD CAFE or pleasant and simple like ZUCKERBABY There are many movies that I don t care for but can see why others would enjoy them or find some value in them This movie was just drivel it had no redeeming features There was no plot only there slightest hint of a story It was not an art film it was incoherent to the point of wondering what was going on There were many scenes that added nothing to the film either in terms of the plot or the mood The photograpy was technically good but special effects were used everywere and just irritated the viewer Anyone can rotate a polariser while filming Large uninteruped sections of dialog in german exceeded the ability of most people to extrapolate from the context This should have been a short story 15 minutes at the most I really resent having paid A 10 to see this especially when it is advertised as brilliant like bagdad cafe In short it isn t it is a great dissapointment
0824,Metropolitan,1990,METROPOLITAN is about a group of TwentySomethings self described as Urban Haute Bourgeois However it s not yet another movie about rich people Most movies made today unless they are explicitly about an underclass or a Dark Side are made about fictional characters with enough money to decorate a set The makers of movies for the most part lack the imagination to see that there is any sort of interesting freedom in characters explicitly constrained by the need to earn money This is perhaps because the lives of such people have a highly iterative character get up catch the bus work go home da capo but a Minimalist composer such as Phillip Glass has made something out of sheer iteration and the film My Dinner With Andre has as a secondary character one who quite unusually practically makes an appeal for personal financial salvation in his own movie Although the characters in METROPOLITAN are not immediately worried about paying the rent there is an interesting tension between their elite background shopping at Brooks Brothers and the rather humdrum prospects they enjoy The movie makes the point that even an expensive education is no guarantee of self fulfillment or even of an interesting or rewarding job One of the best scenes in the film takes place at T J Melon s an East Side watering hole where two of the main characters meet up with a semi failure in unfashionably wide lapels and a Princeton tie More poignantly one of the characters of the film is the son of divorced parents Divorce of course introduces steep decline in the lives of the ex wife and the children who usually stay with the ex wife It s hard for the characters in this situation not to at least try to keep up appearances and the note of shabby gentility is a new element in American film For films up to now have been stories of social ascent whether legal or illegal cf THE GODFATHER Somewhat more innovative are stories of recovery as in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE where a character finds that her decline is due to character flaws which she can herself change Any decline undergone by the characters in METROPOLITAN is not due to character flaws The people in this film are noble in a fashion that reminds the viewer of Jane Austen a writer discussed in the movie The men in particular clumsily try to behave as paladins in a way thought outdated even in F Scott Fitzgerald s time which is decried as sexist by the women but which provides the slightly disappointing resolution of the movie Underneath the modulated voices the chivalry I sensed a low key and smoldering anger in METROPOLITAN This is an anger at fathers who absented themselves from families in their own search for self fulfillment Unlike the modal fathers of my generation I m 40 who came home to their families and who exhausted themselves meeting their needs the father of the generation of METROPOLITAN is presented as one overly concerned with his own needs who moves for example to New Mexico without telling his son and who leaves his son s old toys in the street for his son to stumble upon Manhattan is a small place in its way Since it s too hard to confront the Father directly we get instead a large aristocratic figure in a pony tail who is the same age as the characters in METROPOLITAN but who comports himself according to one of them in a despicable way This involves treating women as sex objects Although the male characters in making this charge are themselves charged with sexism by the women in the film they are obviously reacting to the economic sexism of fathers who left their families in the financial lurch in a way described by Barbara Ehrenreich see her books THE HEARTS OF MEN and THE WORST YEARS OF OUR LIVES A hundred years ago the character who confronts Lord PonyTail would have charged him with toying with the affections of women I half expected a challenge to a duel in one drawing room scene Now the charge is that Lord PonyTail is treating women as sex objects Are the two charges actually equivalent But Lord PonyTail whose long hair now marks him as Out Of The Past is not really the hero s father any more than the gun the hero pulls is a real gun Audrey is at once amused and impressed by her parfit gentil knight s assault on The Dark Tower Perhaps this leaves room at the end for forgiveness of the real father Can the real fathers of that generation redeem themselves Question for discussion is the real father that generation which treated child support as a non starter for much the same reasons they treated energy conservation as a non starter That generation which has several divisions of TwentySomethings in the Persian Gulf at risk as I write for this reason
0825,Pacific Heights,1990,Law favors the tenant Nobody likes to see people thrown out on the street where they have no place to go It is generally assumed that the landlord if better off than the tenant so in many states the law favors the tenant This does not seem to be a very likely fact on which to base a film thriller Most of us have heard horror stories about landlord tenant relations with one side or the other doing monstrous things but that sort of horror story is rarely made into a movie It is much easier to make and sell a horror film about say a vampire than it is to make one about rental relations though I somehow suspect there are more bad tenants in the world than there are vampires In the past real estate horror has generally been mixed with comedy in films as in the classic MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE and its recent pale shadow THE MONEY PIT So PACIFIC HEIGHTS gets points for some originality and even some clever plotting Unfortunately both seem to run out about two thirds of the way into the film Then the film starts showing us things we ve seen before and finally falls into cliche And contrived cliche at that Patty Palmer and Drake Goodman played by Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine are two young people starting out life together buying a house and renting out the first floor as apartments Think of them as minnows And as their new tenant they have attractive persuasive Carter Hayes played by Michael Keaton Think of him as a shark Carter does not just know his legal rights as a tenant he understands how to use those rights in intelligent and creative ways to grind up and swallow his unsuspecting landlords And all the while he is doing this grinding the law is on his side and pulling for him Had this been a film about a monster whose powers were all granted him by the law PACIFIC HEIGHTS could have been a terrific thriller that would have been making a powerful statement Unfortunately at some point someone decided that Carter Hayes would be more than a crooked tenant he would also be a psychopath It may be the first horror film about real estate law ever but it is probably the second or third film with a psychotic villain this month When the psychotic side of Hayes becomes more important than his legal savvy PACIFIC HEIGHTS just falls apart The screenplay is Daniel Pyne s first and is inspired by his own experience as a landlord Presumably he had an axe to grind Curiously his screenplay starts faltering only when he stops grinding it I give PACIFIC HEIGHTS a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0826,Postcards from the Edge,1990,I once dreamed that I was a Kung Fu fighter fending off several thugs at once on the edge of a precipice I thought then in the morning how unusual that dream was for a girl to have and I think now what a perfect analogy it is for POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE This movie is not the comedy I took it to be from it promotion although it is consistently light and subtly witty And the promotion also led me to hope for some hot scenes with Dennis Quaid a la THE BIG EASY No such luck But on the positive side it was not the heavy message movie I feared it would be either despite its anti drug theme There are no heavy themes of life vs death or good vs evil What messages there are to be found in this film are indeed like postcards short friendly and to the point And rather disjointed There is no central theme in this movie so it does not build to a grand finale like a Great Work of Art It is simply a woman struggling through a difficult point in her life against several different but related problems like my Kung Fu fighter dealing with several thugs at once And like Robin Hood or Zorro the hero s motto is be light hearted be gallant don t hurt any one and laugh in the face of death In the movie she fights her problems as they come Sometimes she seems to fall back and is pushed to the edge then comes back strong Sometimes she grabs on to weapon that breaks in her hands But she is always a fighter Her habits may be self destructive but she is determined to win The heroine s self image as a woman is I think the real theme of this movie It is as though she did not quite pass puberty but failed it She has remained like a pre pubescent poised to become a woman but blocked from passing over the edge of childhood into womanhood and the block in her Mother To grow up would be to compete with her overwhelming mother at Her own game There is a theory post Freudian I think that a young girl s first love is her mother and to grow up she must instead learn to identify with and to be like her mother There are scenes especially the first singing scene when this dynamic seems clearly to be the heroine s central problem But whether or not you find this theme intriguing you will probably enjoy POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE It is light interesting and amusing It has many unexpected twists and surprise the singing is wonderful
0827,Night of the Living Dead,1990,George A Romero may have more of a one track mind than than do the zombies that star in his most famous films Ever since the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD more than 22 years ago Romero has strayed very little from his very successful formula Over the course of two sequels and now a remake Romero knows what works and he knows what sells But perhaps it s time that he and Tom Savini creature FX and makeup whiz and the director of the remake move on The Phantom isn t quite sure what motivated Romero and Savini to work on a remake of their classic horror film certainly there have been sequels official and unofficial and homages galore since the debut of the original NIGHT They themselves effectively updated the tale with DAWN OF THE DEAD in 1979 and with DAY OF THE DEAD they closed out the series on an intellectual note though to be fair there was at least as much cannibalism as intellectualism in DAY OF THE DEAD In addition to the two official sequels there have been countless variations on the same theme including the Sam Raimi s excellent EVIL DEAD series and the horror comedy RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD And of course there have been endless Italian zombie films most of them bad some of them like Lucio Fulci s ZOMBIE good and all of them dubbed So why another LIVING DEAD film And why a remake of the original instead of at least attempting a new twist on an old theme The Phantom isn t sure though he certainly sympathizes with one possible motivation he too has rent to pay You don t have to be a studio executive to realize that there s a guaranteed audience for anything with Living Dead in the title and that the audience for such a film probably doubles if the name Romero appears on the marquee And although it might be interesting to find a new angle on an age old theme there s nothing inherently wrong with remakes In fact some of the best horror films of recent times have been remakes including THE FLY INASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE THING while some of the worst have been sequels including all of the HALLOWEEN and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and arguably half of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films all of which tried and failed to find a new way to recapture the success of their predecessors Except that the remake of NIGHT isn t so much a remake as a rehash it s just a colorless colorization of the original While films like THE FLY and THE THING effectively updated their respective tales Romero s remake is sort of like the Ted Turner approach to filmmaking take an old classic muck around with it a little put it in a shiny new box and voila New product So in a sense the remake of NIGHT is really nothing more than a re release though with a few new scenes and without a few old ones Other than that the plot is exactly the same the setting is almost exactly the same the characters are almost exactly the same with one notable exception Barbara to whom the Phantom will soon turn his attention and even the zombies are almost exactly the same What isn t the same of course are the expectations of the audience While a film about a small group of people under siege by hundreds of zombies lusting for human flesh was startling disquieting and shocking in the late sixties it is perhaps sadly somewhat old hat now These days if one wants to explore such shopworn themes one must generally go the serious high tech monster gore route Cronenberg did it with THE FLY though it would have been a fine film horror or otherwise even without all the gore Carpenter did it with THE THING It was even done with THE BLOB though with considerably less success though the Phantom will always count the scene where one of the hapless townfolk gets sucked down a kitchen drain as one of his all time favorites Yet Romero and Savini are remarkably restrained throughout NIGHT in fact the Phantom believes that the original may even be a little gorier So without gore what have we left Well there s Tom Savini s adept direction though he is certainly no Cronenberg or Raimi Savini proves that he can sustain suspense and set up enough spooky scenes to make up for the long sequences that more or less fall flat But although the right scenes are suspenseful in the right places Savini seems to have a better feel for the obvious gross out than he does for more subtle scenes of terror not surprising considering how he got his start in film For example the many scenes of zombie hands breaking through boarded up windows are still scary and the scenes inherent visual contradictions the everyday ordinariness of a living room intruded upon by walking corpses are as disquieting as ever But Savini doesn t seem to have Romero s flair for the subtle touches that are all the more effective because they are not show stopping gross outs In an early scene Savini plays the camera on and around an obese zombie killed and left in the living room by Barbara when she first enters the house a change from the original screenplay He even attempts a Raimi esque scene with the zombie s severed hand and that scene works in a bizarre tension relieving way but what s the point if the rest of the film is going to be such a slavish copy of the original Raimi succeeded with just this kind of over the top horror with gratuitous gross outs galore because the images and tension never stopped But NIGHT shifts uncomfortably back and forth between standard gross out horror and the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the hallmark of the original while Savini doesn t seem to be able to decide how he wants to play things Romero s script on the other hand doesn t help matters While the original NIGHT will never be confused with Hamlet the amateurish script fit with the general low budget mood of the film and at least it never made us wince But together with the generally awful acting it s difficult to get through the remake without either laughing or yawning The black protagonist Ben seems more or less a carbon copy of the original Ben and Romero does a reasonable job of giving the voice of reason interesting things to pontificate on But the selfish side of ourselves Harry Cooper is simply out of control Cooper is stuck doing and saying patently ridiculous things and the actor who portrays him appears to be trying out for a part in a David Mamet play The Phantom fully expected Cooper to start frothing at the mouth and munching on the furniture it is a scenery chewing performance from beginning to end Ben responds in kind and many too many scenes play like outtakes from a particularly inept production of Raisun in the Sun Finally there s Barbara who represents the biggest departure from the original film Phans may remember that the character was a traumatized young woman who we first meet as she visits her mother s grave while her brother relentlessly teases her about the zombies who are coming to get you Bar bar a But in the original NIGHT Barbara is barely able to cope once she arrives at the house and she ends up being little more than a sexist hindrance to Ben and Tom as they try to reinforce the house and save everyone from the zombies But horror is in its post ALIENS period now and hysterical female characters just don t cut it anymore So Romero has updated Barbara and turned her into a Ripley clone complete with assault rifle and undershirt It s not clear to the Phantom why the 90 s Ripley character tricked out in lingerie and combat boots is any less sexist than the traditional hysterical female character who has starred in horror films since the 50 s In some ways it seems like a real step backward from the nearly three dimensional female characters who spent all their time saving their boyfriends and killing Jason and his clones in the 80 s In any case this politically correct touch leaves the script unbalanced since now both she and Ben are ready to save everyone else losing in the process one of the few ironic touches of the original film If the voice of reason isn t going to win and then get killed by the gun toting yahoos who mistake him for a zombie what s the point Romero seems concerned about this as well and at one point Barbara is in fact forced to say We re them And they re us But she could only believe this because she loses her glasses near the beginning of the film for the audience the line is just another laugher Instead the message of the film is nearly Rambo esque ALIENS was after all nothing but an updated war film bizarrely this runs directly counter to the pacifist tendencies of the original though the Phantom realizes that any film that features cannibalism walking corpses and matricide can t be pacifistic in the strictest sense of the word The Phantom was also saddened to see that some of the classic horror scenes from the original are either missing or changed for the worse For example Savini implies but never shows us the zombies feasting on the recently dead And one of the most famous scenes in horror film history that of the little girl zombie killing her mother with a garden spade has been turned into a kind of in joke a nudge nudge wink wink for phans of the original Had Romero and Savini intended this NIGHT to be a spoof as Raimi intended EVIL DEAD 2 to be a spoof of his own horror classic some of the changes might have been fun at least for horror phans who were familiar with the original but as it is the changes feel awkward in a film that is otherwise so slavish a copy of the original There are other in jokes throughout the new NIGHT including a brief cameo by Romero himself and in fact the film really does play better for true horror phans than it does for the casual viewer Now lest this review sound too negative the Phantom should hasten to point out that while the new NIGHT is nothing special neither is it outright unbearable or disappointing But that said there seems little reason to see it especially when the original is available even in a hideous colorized version for a buck from your local Blockbusters Hard core horror phans biding their time until GRAVEYARD SHIFT CHILD S PLAY II and MISERY open in a few weeks might want to take a look if only to satisfy their curiousity or so that they could continue to say that they ve seen everything by Romero a true horror film legend But everyone else would probably be better off with the more atmospheric and certainly more original original Perhaps if the box office for NIGHT is lower than expected Romero and Savini will get back into the sequel making business and produce new LIVING DEAD tales though the Phantom should note that he retains the copyrights on the titles Twilight of the Dead Evening of the Dead and Tea Time of the Dead should Messrs Romero and Savini wish to use any of these titles they are advised to contact the Phantom s attorney to work out all the gory details
0828,Henry & June,1990,This is the movie that forced the MPAA to create a new rating Maybe I m just getting old but I can t figure out why There is a fair amount nudity in the movie but the sex scenes are generally not all that erotic HENRY JUNE is supposed to be the true story of Anais Nin Henry Miller both famous writers The June in the title is Miller s wife June a woman whose very picture alters the lives of characters in this movie Perhaps it s the sort of movie that if you re a fan of either writer it works on the level of providing lots of background Since I m not I didn t like the movie as much as I expected to It really doesn t have much of a plot The movie follows Anais her husband Hugo sort of 30s French yuppies as they drift from place to place and discuss that Anais will probably have an affair with an older man Enter Henry Miller The relationships between Anais Hugo and Henry are quite complicated Anais wants Henry both as a fellow writer and as a person who clearly enjoys sexual experimentation Henry wants sex wherever he can get it but he s very cautious around Anais Hugo pretty much ignores the situation though it s clear he knows more about it than Anais thinks he does The performances are okay but not much to write home about The actress portraying Anais Nin is particularly good a new young Spanish actress playing Anais with a wonderful French accent The French accents clash with the strong Brooklynese of both Fred Ward playing Henry Miller and Uma Thurman playing June With the exception of Anais the characters were in desperate need of charisma transplants to pull this film off Kaufman has cast his movies very successfully in the past and I m not sure why he didn t succeed this time though Alec Baldwin was originally supposed to have played Miller The photography in this movie is lovely The point of view in this movie wanders many scenes are shot in mirrors so it s a little disconcerting at times The distinctions between dreams and reality are not very well defined which made reality a little difficult to follow The dialogue is fine but the plot is very slow going and would have benefited by a little tightening There are some good scenes and whenever June confronts someone you know she often speaks the truth There are also a few lovely observations during the course of the movie about sex and desire and these observations are often quite subtle On the whole I can only give this movie a 6 on the Chuck scale The movie promises a lot but fails to deliver If you want to see a truly erotic movie go back and rent THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING Kaufman did it right that time While I don t think there are particular spoilers in this movie I suppose I ought to warn you just in case Perhaps the main reasons for the new rating relate more to the treatment of morality in the movie There is quite a bit of nudity in the movie both in a long parade of under costumed art students and in several scenes in a brothel When Hugo tells Anais he ll do anything sexual for her she takes him to a brothel and they watch female prostitutes perform sexually for each other When the prostitutes ask them to join in they decline While the lesbian aspect of the film has been discussed quite a bit the most explicit material is in the afore mentioned scene in the brothel And it really wasn t all that erotic the scene in LIGHTNESS when one woman photographs the other was much more charged While Anais spends most of the movie lusting after June it s clear nothing ever would have worked out between them Anais is a cultured European and June is a Brooklyn taxi dancer Anais is generally very controlled and June is just explosive June is portrayed as an unbelievably manipulative bitch in this movie Henry is a somewhat softer version of June but he has the ability to be an artist something that June even though she supports him just doesn t understand
0829,Henry & June,1990,This is the first NC17 movie a fact which will no doubt put you in good stead in some future trivia game The movie is considered too much for kids but too good not to be rated and given entree to the world s multiplexes The most unconventional thing about HENRY JUNE is the lavish scenes of sex between women As a gay man I have to say that I grew a trifle restive at so much of it even if the photography was uniformly excellent and the actors attractive and interesting people All I m saying is that the sex the eroticism is not for me the reason to see HENRY JUNE Acting script character development these are the reasons to see HENRY JUNE The three principals Fred Ward as Henry Miller Uma Thurman DANGEROUS LIAISONS as his wife June and Maria de Madeiros as Anais Nin give magnificently complex performances Of the three Madeiros is the most attractive but Thurman is the most interesting June is in many ways the focus of the film since both Miller and Nin not only sleep with her as well as each other but write books about her Nin is the narrative focus of the film which is about inter alia her relationships with the title characters she is in every scene she is the narrator it is through her eyes and her diaries that we see the world And Madeiros is wonderfully right She looks like Nin small strong huge eyed unblinking all seeing very private very open Fred Ward s Miller is less successful only by comparison Miller is portrayed very much as a traditional man blind to who the women in his life were except insofar as they were extensions of himself As a man he is limited in what he can see feel or think These things I think are how Nin sees him regardless of how he was But always I come back to Thurman s June whore muse patrona con woman strong intensely afraid of death Obsessed with finding a great writer who could portray her as she felt she was always disappointed angry loving ungrateful impossible manipulating independent clinging It is as complete a a portrait of a human being as I have ever seen on film and a stunning achievement for the actor
0830,Henry & June,1990,OVERVIEW A look at the relationship erotic and literary between Anais Nin Henry Miller and their respective spouses Hugo and June REVIEW I m sure by now we re all familiar with the hype surrounding the recent release of HENRY AND JUNE the first film to receive the MPAA s newly minted NC 17 rating which Tom Shales of NPR tells us stands for Not in Cincinnati or a 17 mile radius thereof It s been banned in some cities and been called an erotic masterpiece in others So what s the film like Well first and foremost to my eye it s a Philip Kaufman film director of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING Every scene positively drips atmosphere Everyone smokes some gracefully Kaufman has populated Nin s Paris with a remarkable collection of hookers thiefs and bizarrely wandering street magicians who stiffen and relax ropes make stolen wallets become doves and other strange things that really have no bearing on anything as far as I can tell There are romantic fogs poetic rainstorms and dramatic thunder and lightning scenes Kaufman s feel runs through the entire film his thumbprint is on every scene Second of course it s about Nin and Miller two writers of erotic literature and players in the erotic lifestyle In the first instance as an atmosphere film it succeeds The film lays it on a bit thick for my tastes and the elements of drama lurch a little too much into the arena of melodrama I think But the atmosphere is maintained and the film is beautiful to look at And as a display of acting talents it s excellent Fred Ward certainly makes the most of his role as does Maria de Madeiros Uma Thurman made me actively dislike her and feel uncomfortable when she was on screen quite a contrast to my reactions to her previous roles in BARON MUNCHAUSEN and DANGEROUS LIAISONS The only character who seems weak is Hugo and it is difficult to say whether this is the fault of a very weak character or poor acting although I am inclined to think it is the former Certainly as his is played Hugo is a boring obtuse nerd of a man not what I would call a plum role Finally we come to the story As a story this film is somewhat uneven This is not what you would call a classic conflict resolution drama it is more the story of Anais Nin s coming of age and Henry Miller and his wife June was the catalyst for that coming of age While I found her story interesting it was certainly less than fascinating for me and I left the theatre feeling somewhat unfulfilled How did this relationship change her life How did it change Henry Miller s life What happened to the two marriages The film remains mute on these subjects and left me somewhat frustrated As for the erotic elements they have been overadvertised as far as I can see There are certainly a lot of breasts and buttocks shown on the screen and a number of fairly graphic but certainly far from hardcore lovemaking scenes but none of them really struck me as erotic Most of the sex in this film struck me as more animalistic and desperate than erotic Unless you find raw rut erotic you probably won t find this film very erotic There are those that might argue that what we saw wasn t raw rut but it certainly looked that way to me Overall an interesting film that was worth seeing I think you absolutely have to suspend your disbelief and if you can you will enjoy this movie If you can t the atmosphere and melodrama might get in your way Certainly not an erotic masterpiece but also far from being a dog I give it a 6

0832,Millers Crossing,1990,I thoroughly enjoyed MILLER S CROSSING a powerful original and sometimes very funny gangster picture written directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen the same team that created BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA The story is about rival gangs Irish Italian and Jewish and their struggles to control the rackets cops and politicians in a nameless American city that might be Boston in the 1920s or early 1930s One of the impressive achievements of this film I think is how the Coen brothers create a generic city of darkness and lawlessness that refers as much to the history of gangster films as any real time and place These guys make movies with great style lots of surprises lots of rolling cameras following characters around moving in slowly on people or chasing after them constantly changing the audience s point of view No doubt Alfred Hitchcock is one of the big influences on their style When they do a violent scene it always contains a surprise of some kind an unpredictable and uncontrollable element sometimes a laugh the message I think is that violence is the height of human stupidity The Coen brothers also have something to say about greed and corruption in this movie We get a vision of life without love and trust and the ethical codes that come from respect for other human beings Characters are corrupted to different degrees We hear them rationalize about the compromises they make and some even take pride in the ethics that they bring to their business of using hurting robbing and killing people The movie asks the audience to reflect on its own compromises its own fearful obedience to the system our own inabilities to love and trust At the center of the film are great performances the always wonderful Albert Finney as the Irish boss whose soft heart is his tragic flaw Gabriel Byrne remember this guy from SIESTA as a dark hearted black Irishman who is brilliant at the art of survival but too damaged to love or trust anyone and John Turturro ferret faced actor who was Sal s racist son in DO THE RIGHT THING as an especially slippery and desperate Jewish punk There is also a great performance by a bald headed fat actor as the Italian crime boss anybody catch his name Also the characters in the film often refer to Turturro s character as a Shmata or The Shmata Does anybody know what this means is it Jewish Irish Italian Schmata is Yiddish for rag Moderator Altogether a memorable bunch of grotesque characters lost in the darkness
0833,Jacobs Ladder,1990,Within the space of a few short months Bruce Joel Rubin has had two films he has written released Each deals with death GHOST had a few heavy horror moments but they were counter acted by a lot of lighter and more pleasant moments Pleasant however is not a term applicable to any single sequence in JACOB S LADDER While it probably has the more intelligent and demanding story JACOB S LADDER is a Gordian knot of unpleasant concepts It is a story of disturbing horror requiring some effort and detective work to come to any consistent interpretation and then open to multiple interpretations This is one weird movie It is October 6 1971 and a company of American soldiers in Vietnam is getting ready to move into battle Suddenly something is going very wrong Some of the men are convulsing others are running around fighting as if an enemy whom we do not see is right there on top of them One of the soldiers Jacob played by Tim Robbins is bayonetted in the stomach and left for dead Flash forward several years and Jacob is a postman living in a surrealistically squalid New York City Sights that the audience finds ugly or even terrifying seem commonplace in Jacob s everyday existence But things are happening that are not commonplace for Jacob Something is stalking Jacob or perhaps someone who can call up faceless demons And as if that were not enough the world seems to be deteriorating and people are mutating in some mysterious ways that only Jacob sees Jacob is even a little unstuck in time as images from the past flood on him as if they are the present This is an unpleasant and uncomfortable horror film to sit through be warned It improves a great deal on thinking about it afterward Just as is true with many of the individual scenes of this film so too when the entire film is over we are tantalizingly unsure of exactly what we have seen and how it is to be interpreted Adrian Lyne who directed FLASHDANCE FATAL ATTRACTION and 9 1 2 WEEKS photographed this film in murky muted colors much as FLATLINERS was photographer but his visual style picks out the squalid and the disturbing Murky colors are an intelligent ploy to get around audience insistence on color photography but still have mood effects that one usually can get only with monochrome I rated this film a low 1 leaving the theater but it improves greatly on reflection and at this point I would rate it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale As early as when Jacob is dropped off at the locked subway station I started thinking this was a re working of Ambrose Bierce s Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge I left the theater assuming that was correct However that would imply that the entire future is fictional But Jacob s entire knowledge of The Ladder is from the future Yet Jacob has already seen the convulsions that are explained only by The Ladder If the convulsions are real we must interpret The Ladder as real If The Ladder is real then some of the future is really happening also Suddenly the story is less like the Bierce and much more like CARNVAL OF SOULS where the soul survives and assumes it is still alive and the living take it for a living soul The faceless demons could even be a direct borrowing of the carnival dead in CARNIVAL OF SOULS Well if you re going to borrow borrow from the best
0834,Ladri di saponette,1989,Over the weekend I saw the Italian film THE ICICLE THIEF I m surprised that I haven t seen any mention of it on the net unless it was all during my vacation a couple of weeks ago I m cross posting to rec arts tv because TV is part of the subject matter of the movie THE ICICLE THIEF is a wonderful satire and spoof It s a satire of the butchering that is done to films in order to show them on TV using the film within a film technique and turning it inside out The inner film is a drama about a family after WWII in turmoil because the father can t find work The outer film is about activities at the TV studio broadcasting the film preceded by a review and interview with the director the outer director playing himself part of the outer film also takes place in the living room of a family watching the movie a must see for Lego lovers could someone tell me what the kid built Since the movie is being shown on a commercial TV station it is periodically interrupted by commercials Things get strange though when one of the children in the inner movie starts humming one of the jingles and an actress from one of the commercials shows up in the movie After this things get very weird but I won t say any more since I promised only minor spoilers This is definitely one of the funniest movies I ve seen in a long time The subtitling was done very well I hardly ever had trouble reading the dialogue
0835,Reversal of Fortune,1990,Capsule review Famous lawyer Alan Dershowitz defends Claus von Bulow in this adaptation of Dershowitz s book While none of the characters is anyone you would really want to know or even deal with some of the re assessment of what appears initially to be an open and shut case is reminiscent of TWELVE ANGRY MEN Rating high 1 4 to 4 There is an old exchange where one person says The rich are different from us And the other person responds Yes they have more money REVERSAL OF FORTUNE gives us glimpses into quite a few things but one is the lifestyles of the very rich What we see is less than totally inviting In REVERSAL OF FORTUNE our first impressions of Claus von Bulow play off all our prejudices against the European aristocracy He is cultured cold emotionless and calculating He seems a marble statue that has been granted the power of speech In a sense he is the damsel in distress of this piece As the film begins he has already been found guilty of the attempted murder of his wife Sunny To avoid going to prison he gets trial lawyer and professor of law Alan Dershowitz to defend him Of course as a matter of record Dershowitz did successfully appeal the conviction and in a retrial had von Bulow acquitted of the charges REVERSAL OF FORTUNE based on Dershowitz s own book is the story of how Alan Dershowitz defended the impassive Claus von Bulow The film also gives us a view into Dershowitz s unorthodox defense procedures He turns his house into a workshop with teams in each room researching the legal ramifications of a different piece of evidence against von Bulow The teams even have sweatshirts labeled with the piece of evidence they are working on Dershowitz may be bragging about the completeness of his approach but in fact one may wonder at the fairness of expending this magnitude of resource in a legal action Dershowitz moralizes why he should take the case even if von Bulow is so likely guilty but the audience never works up the respect for him and his methods that it has for the dramatized Clarence Darrow in INHERIT THE WIND or the dramatized Louis Nizer in A CASE OF LIBEL His causes are not so noble and his fees are higher As unflattering as this film was to Claus whose only moments of humanity seem to be when he is having fun with his own ghoulish image in the press REVERSAL OF FORTUNE is far less flattering to Sunny This daughter of the idle rich is shown to have been mostly dead already by his own actions She is totally idle and self indulgent Her hours out of bed which number only six a day are a constant struggle to pass through he system every drug she can lay her shaking hands on Regardless of anything Claus did we are led to believe that death or near death was the expected and logical result of an incredibly self destructive lifestyle If she was really as portrayed one wonders how she survived as long as she did In addition to Dershowitz s moralizing there is one more piece of moralizing that is irritating in the film The film pokes fun at von Bulow s patronizing if well intentioned attitude toward Dershowitz being Jewish Yet several times the camera takes opportunities to remind us that Dershowitz is not just a lawyer he is a JEWISH lawyer Camera angles are chosen to show a painting on a Jewish theme in Dershowitz s office or to show a menorah in his home The camera is just as hung up on religion as is von Bulow Of the three stars Glenn Close as Sunny von Bulow has top billing and got the least screen time She does however narrate the story in spite of the fact that it makes little sense to have a narrator who is speaking from a coma and who was less than a clear thinker even before her coma Some attention has been paid to Jeremy Irons s performance as Claus though I have always thought it is easier to be convincingly weird than to be convincingly normal On the whole REVERSAL OF FORTUNE panders a bit too much to the fans of crime docudramas But it is told with wit and subtlety I would give it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0836,Quigley Down Under,1990,QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER has Tom Selleck doing a Western except in this case it s Western Australia supposedly Actually it appears from the credits that most of the movie was shot in Northern Territory But none of that is obvious to most Americans for whom this movie was made Now I have to say I like Tom Selleck he s handsome and easy on the eye He can speak his lines in a reasonable sort of a way unlike say Arnold Schwarzenegger I ve seen all of Tom s movies pardon the familiarity of a fan and he has certainly made some worse ones than this It s action adventure revenge justice for the Aborigines a crazy woman a wonderfully despicable heavy It s astonishing scenery As Douglas Adams might have said Australia is big mind bogglingly big etc What I like about the film include the villain the scenery the Aborigines Tom and after we know why she s crazy the woman What I don t like is the second hand big screen Western movie music which overplays every scene There is even this banjo piece which made me think we had slipped through a wormhole and landed in New Orleans The movie could have been a lot more Australian and a lot less of a transplanted American western
0837,Memphis Belle,1990,Capsule review Disappointing and undoubtedly fictionalized account of the twenty fifth mission of the first B 17 crew to reach that number and be sent home Eight real B 17s were used and they deserve billing above the likes of Matthew Modine Eric Stoltz and John Lithgow Rating low 1 4 to 4 Undeniably there is some truth to this story The Memphis Belle really was the first B 17 Flying Fortress to complete twenty five missions and hence win its flight crew an opportunity to go home and sit out the rest of the war in celebrity and with relatively cushy assignments Hence there really was a twenty fifth mission of the Memphis Belle Whether the first twenty four missions were as routine as suggested in the film and the twenty fifth was as dangerous that I am somewhat skeptical about I take most of the film with more than one grain of salt The drama is pat the characters are stereotypes In fact the script candidly tells you that the characters are going to be stereotypes There s always one guy who s very religious always one guy from Cleveland we are told in the first scene So of course we have these cliched characters here This is not TWELVE O CLOCK HIGH and it is not one of the great adventure films about World War II It is however a very nice film to look at The music and the decoration have a nice feel of 1943 even if one can argue that the party is a bit lavish for a humble air base But the real visual splendor is in seeing genuine B 17s taking off and flying together I think most people get some sort of a charge out of seeing airplanes flying and there is a lot of flying in this film Basically Memphis Belle details for the viewer several of the more common hazards of bombing runs over Germany You see air battles you see near misses light collisions and heavy collisions You see flying through a shower of flak You see people getting shot up and mid air surgery Mostly you see a lot of scenes you have seen in other films Yet somehow the film falls short of actually generating real excitement or tension We know the Belle is going to get back and the characters are not real enough and certainly not endearing enough for us really to worry about their individual safety The film has a few too many contrived touches even to have a feel of authenticity It has fliers mistaking tomato soup for blood It has a dog who recognizes the sound of his master s plane engines Touches like these get in the way of the audience taking the story very seriously This is a pretty film to watch but both too shallow in its drama and too unexceptional in its action really to engage an audience I give it a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0838,Frankenstein Unbound,1990,I saw this film tonight and liked what I saw The return of Roger Corman to directing and a thinking horror film Roger Corman s directing doesn t have any cinematic moments and isn t filled with stylish touches like Ridley Scott s but shows the work of a man who knows his craft returning to work It is very able directing and adding that he hasn t worked on a film other than as a producer for 15 years shouldn t draw too many complaints I will add that it is atmospheric One of my friends compares the atmosphere to that of Corman s Poe films he s only seen the second half of this film though The film casts John Hurt as Buchanan a weapons scientist who finds himself sent back in time to Geneva in 1817 Buchanan s first encounter in this strange land is with another scientist Victor Frankenstein played by Raul Julia Buchanan also encounters Bridget Fonda as Mary Shelley who was beginning her novel FRANKENSTEIN at this time Needless to say the acting is top notch including the actor who plays the monster The film deals with Buchanan reflecting on his role in science drawing parallels to Frankenstein and his semi thinking creation The film was shot on location in Italy and the costuming is good The soundtrack works well with the film There is little blood and gore despite the R rating and is well served when used This is a thinking horror film with not a lot of action or scares We haven t had a horror film like this since the 1970s I m not saying that this film is very thought provoking after the film but it does sustain interest during the film I heartily recommend this film and am sort of glad that it wasn t hyped up as a Halloween horror film I d list it as one of the best if not the best horror films of the year and among the better films of any type this year This film may be getting a limited release if any nationwide even though it is being distributed by 20th Century Fox I saw only one small ad this weekend out of several newspapers and no tv ads or theatrical trailers for this film There weren t even any reviews in the papers for this film I find it odd that this film isn t getting noticed in its release since director Roger Corman was everywhere this summer on tv and in print discussing his old films and actors actresses directors he discovered trained his new book on his old films etc and discussing his new film FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND sans film clips though In Boston it has an exclusive engagement on what I believe to be the largest screen not theater capacity in a Boston movie theater the Charles At the 9 40 PM Friday showing there were a total of 17 people there I don t think it s going to stay there long with that kind of attendance I wonder how the movie would have done with more promotion I give a Joe Bob Briggs type 3B count this film has blood 2 beasts and possibly 1 breast may be prosthetic Look for Frankenstein s improvements of people including 2 thumbs
0839,Avalon,1990,Capsule review A loving portrait of a Jewish family in post World War II Baltimore makes AVALON one of Barry Levinson s best films to date Levinson has a real talent for dialogue and for creating memorable characters This is a film to be enjoyed more than once Rating 3 Barry Levinson has made such diverse films as THE NATURAL GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and RAIN MAN But he chronically returns to his native Baltimore to tell the stories of the people he knew when he was growing up His first film was the excellent DINER TIN MEN was set in part in the same Baltimore diner though the story was a cut below his first film AVALON is a very different Baltimore story and rivals THE NATURAL as Levinson s best work AVALON follows the fortunes of an immigrant Jewish family in the years following World War II Central to the story is a grandfather grandson relationship very probably based on Levinson s relationship with his own grandfather The portrait of the family is at once realistic and endearing This is not so much a story with a single conflict that is resolved in the end but more a chronicle told in episodes As the film opens we are in the mind and memory of Sam Krichinsky as he is remembering and relating to his grandchildren how he came to the United States in 1914 and settled in the beautiful city of Baltimore He arrived on July 4th and he is telling the story before dinner on Thanksgiving As the family history progresses it returns again and again to what the family was doing on those two holidays The story is seen very much through the eyes of young Michael Kaye Sam s grandson Levinson s Baltimore films all have excellent dialogue which is at the same time believable and surprisingly entertaining Just simple family chit chat in Levinson s hands becomes both revealing and endearing Michael s father Jules is a salesman who is mugged in front of Michael To keep Jules entertained as he is recovering his cousin buys the family s first television set This leads to a whole new career of selling first televisions then appliances at discount The success brings tragedy at least as far as Michael is concerned the family moves to the suburbs Soon conflicts arise that seem serious to the family but which clearly seem petty and minor to the viewer Armin Mueller Stahl who played a suspected Nazi in THE MUSIC BOX plays the patriarchal Sam Krichinsky His son Jules is played by Aidan Quinn And Jules s son Michael is played by Elijah Wood Elizabeth Perkins and Joan Plowright help to round out the cast in this loving scrapbook of the life of a family This is certainly one of the most moving and best films this year I give it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0840,Avalon,1990,AVALON is the third in Barry Levinson s Baltimore trilogy which began with DINER and continued with TIN MEN What links the three movies is setting Baltimore time late 40 s to early 60 s and feeling love compassion sadness nostalgia c They are very personal films and in some ways AVALON is the most personal of them all The title is the name of a street in the row house neighborhoods of working class Baltimore And a ball room And maybe all that Arthurian stuff lurking in the background Now I once lived on Santa Catalina Island and Avalon brings up memories of a slightly different for me but that s my movie ain t it AVALON is one those multigenerational movies that jumps a lot of decades jumbles up a lot of characters and is often a disorganized mess Fortunately in this case Levinson uses several devices to hold the movie together even though it is still too long and unfocused One device is the narrative focus which is primarily the character of Sam Kripinsky who came to America in 1914 It was the most beautiful place he had ever seen to quote Sam s oft repeated story Sam goes from a young man in the prime of his youth all the way through a semi senile oldster waiting to die Sam is played by Armin Stahl Mueller and brilliantly his wife is wonderful and hilarious Joan Plowright who was the major delight in another movie this year as the mother in law of the philanderer whom everyone is out to kill can t dredge it up sorry Another device for unity is the return through the decades to those most American of holidays the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving The changing face of America is clearest is the changing faces of these holidays And it s pretty sad I must say The third device is TV Once the first TV set is turned on there is a set in every room it seems these play out their lives in This is a sweet powerful movie about who we Americans are and how we got this fucked up
0841,White Palace,1990,Max James Spader lives alone in a big expensive house He combs the fringe of his Oriental rug with his fingers Twice in case we didn t catch it the first time Label him Repressed Mr Repressed goes to a bachelor s party bringing with him 50 White Castles uhm White Palaces What is a White Castle Palace I m glad you asked It s a square hamburger with a hole in the middle It s cooked in lots of tasty grease which also flavors the square buns The grease is tasty because they cook onions in it It s more a religion than a meal Anyway trademarks being what they are White Castle is transformed into White Palace So Mr Repressed returns to the party and discovers that he only received 44 White Palaces 6 of the boxes are empty Standing on principle he insists on leaving the party and returning to White Palace to get the other burgers Once there he argues with Nora the Waitress Susan Sarandon and finally gets his 3 00 or so back Yeah I know he was gonna get burgers Hey I didn t write it He returns to the party and has an awful time because for some reason everyone is watching slides and of course the slide projector gets stuck when showing a picture of his dead wife At least the slide didn t burn which is what I was expecting After having such an awful time Mr Repressed goes to a seedy bar Why Well this is just a guess but let s assume that all yuppies are shallow and don t know how to have fun Apparently Mr Repressed recognizes this truth and realizing that low class barflies have more fun drives to the nearest dump Now for the Coincidence Guess who s at the generic seedy bar Guess who does everything she can to pick up Mr Repressed Guess where they wind up The director wanted Sarandon to look and sound cheap She does Time for the Explicit Sex Scene where she uhm either rapes or seduces Mr Repressed take your pick During this scene Nora bestows oral favors thereby reawakening Max s zest for life But wait there s less This is for the most part a cheap shot at a film The more I think about it the less I like it The script depends on our willingness to buy into well worn caricatures Jews are loud opinionated busybodies except of course for the quiet Mr Repressed Waitresses at hamburger joints live in filthy ugly shacks and do nothing but smoke eat litter and screw Young urban professionals are superficial and repressed Etcetera Even the sets are caricatures For example Max s living room contains a baby grand piano Not because of his involvement with music mind you It s yet another prop showing wealth In deliberate contrast Nora s dump of a shack is so dark you ll want out more than she does Which could ve been effective if shown only for a few scenes but nooooooo Nearly the whole movie is filmed there The theme of opposites attracting is just as much a caricature Mr Repressed and Ms Waitress aren t real characters they re grocery lists of stereotypical traits He likes opera she likes the Oak Ridge Boys The story is some sort of weird variant of Cinderella done worse than most writers could manage If that s not sufficient reason to laugh at this film consider the casting James Spader the ultimate WASP is the Jewish yuppie Right Susan Sarandon sports a truly unusual hick accent that I never heard once while I lived in St Louis and I lived there 17 years It s hard to turn a silk purse into a sow s ear There are two very well played scenes though Especially the last scene which cleverly puts a nice taste in your mouth right as you re ready to leave the theatre It s not a total loss just a big disappointment In summary the film is heavy handed in nearly everything it does and there ain t much relief from it A few funny lines seem incredibly clever because they rise out of such a mire Most of the time though you ll feel more out of place in this film than in a David Lynch movie I don t understand why this movie hasn t been blasted by other reviewers What do people see in this film My advice wait for a 1 88 video rental
0842,Jacobs Ladder,1990,The Phantom went into JACOB S LADDER expecting something along the lines of FLATLINERS a fairly standard mainstream thriller with some horror touches enough to give moviegoers a few thrills possibly even a few gross outs but no more than an occasional slightly crazed look or boiled rabbit After all the director Adrian Lyne is a master of the mainstream commercial film with FLASHDANCE 9 1 2 WEEKS and FATAL ATTRACTION to his credit Mr Lyne is nothing if not knowledgeable about what sells and he of all people would know that while audiences do like the occasional scare the real money is in making films that are at heart conventional and predictable above all else So imagine the Phantom s surprise when he found that JACOB S LADDER is as close to a full tilt serious high tech monster psychological thriller as we are likely to get until MISERY opens this Christmas As Lyne took the audience through his rollercoaster ride of a film the Phantom marveled at the camera work the lighting the eerie music and all of the classic horror touches that abounded throughout the film Despite what the studio wishes you to believe JACOB S LADDER is not another GHOST and it s not another FATAL ATTRACTION JACOB S LADDER is a classic traditional horror film the likes of which we haven t seen in a good long while That said the Phantom should also point out that JACOB S LADDER is not a hard core horror film like BRAIN DEAD an excellent low budget film that it resembles in more than a few ways When all is said and done horror gives way to explanation and resolution and truth be told the film s ending is embarrassingly bad But the festival of exposition doesn t begin until the last ten minutes of the film to kick it off one character literally stands facing the camera and explains the entire film to an audience which Mr Lyne and the studio apparently believe has been standing in line for popcorn for the preceding two hours And by that time the Phantom was not only able to forgive Mr Lyne for giving in to convention the quaint American cinematic tradition of supplying a sensible and rational ending to everything but also for directing two of the most awful films of the eighties the Phantom wasn t a particular phan of FATAL ATTRACTION but at least it didn t provide another nail for the coffin of cinematic intelligence as did his two prior efforts JACOB S LADDER begins in Vietnam where we first meet Jake as he and his platoon get involved in serious combat But shortly Jake awakens on the subway bound for the Bergen Street station and home Was the Vietnam episode a dream Is the dirty ill lit subway car a dream and is Jake still in fact in Vietnam Though this last possibility can be dismissed by any New Yorker who would know only too well that Jake s G train was a real life nightmare from which few Brooklyn ites can awaken much of JACOB S LADDER proceeds in just this fashion Much of the time we never really know whether Jake is awake or asleep or if the demons and strange goings on he sees are really happening And just when we re sure that Jake is finally back in reality Lyne pulls the rug out from under us once again and we re off on another loop of the coaster ride For phans who have seen the excellent low budget sleeper BRAIN DEAD this will sound very familiar But where BRAIN DEAD achieved many of its nightmarish effects through the use of graphic gore and a generous helping of red dye 2 in JACOB S LADDER Lyne relies on chipping away at tiny bits of normality a very effective and disturbing technique Instead of putting a headless zombie on the subway Lyne strews trash all over the floor and lets the lights flicker just so But the trash doesn t look like trash you would expect to see on the subway and the lights have a tendency to go out at just the worst times The train itself is deserted but for a woman and a homeless person sleeping on a bench but the woman doesn t respond to Jake when he asks whether or not they ve passed Bergen Street and to be honest she doesn t look quite right In fact she looks like she might have stumbled out of the theater auditorium next door where she could plausibly have played an extra in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD And though Jake is prepared to ignore the homeless person entirely as he leaves the train something on the bench moves We just get a glimpse of it and we don t know what it is but what it isn t is right There s a lot that s not right in Jake s life and throughout the film we find Jake clinging desperately to what he believes is reality Yet it is a reality that is built on a very shaky foundation Jake s mental health The well written script by Bruce Joel Rubin who wrote the immensely popular GHOST hints at possibilities Jake might be suffering from a mental breakdown He might be suffering from the effects of his tour of duty in Vietnam He might be hallucinating possibly because of drugs he took or drugs that were given to him without his knowledge while in the Army And finally he might be dead It is to both Rubin and Lyne s credit that they make the last possibility the most plausible for throughout much of the film it appears that Jake may be slowly descending into hell and the demons he sees appear at least as real as does Jake himself Of course the Phantom would never give away just what exactly is happening there is a definite something alas for as the Phantom mentioned unlike BRAIN DEAD JACOB S LADDER is at heart a mainstream film guessing is half the fun But suffice it to say that things are almost never what they appear to be and that while Lyne has us on the rollercoaster he rarely misses an opportunity to unnerve us to confound us and every once in a while to just plain scare the popcorn out from under our seats There is more than a little ERASERHEAD in this film and Lyne sends shivers down our spines in just the way Lynch did by creating a world in which stockings draped over a shower curtain rod can look sinister in which people s heads shake back and forth much too quickly in which a chiropractor might be an angel and a surgeon a devil and in which almost nothing seems quite right Well not true Although in Jake s world everything seems just a little off in our world there are more than a few things that are exactly right For one the music by Maurice Jarre is wonderful eerie and atmospheric when it needs to be and a delight the rest of the time Lyne uses sound and lighting effects to great advantage but he never over indulges so that the audience becomes aware of his camera tricks And his rips in reality the touches of horror that he sprinkles throughout the film brought tears of joy to the Phantom s jaded eyes Phans who saw THE EXORCIST III remember that many of its special effects were perfectly ordinary objects used in a disturbing context When George C Scott hears that his friend was murdered by having all the blood drained out of his body we are horrified both because the script is so rich and the description is so good and because we see over a dozen small beakers all neatly aligned on a tray that are filled with blood Lyne s effects are like that and JACOB S LADDER succeeds as a horror film where films like LEATHERFACE fail while gore is easy it is rarely scary JACOB S LADDER may not be a hard core horror film like HELLRAISER but in many ways Lyne shows us a more convincing vision of hell than Barker with his team of special effects technicians was able to The performances especially Tim Robbin s as Jake are convincing the script is generally intelligent well written and without too many pointless diversions though there are some and the film like all of Lyne s films looks great It is not a horror film from first frame to last and phans who sneak out of GRAVEYARD SHIFT and into JACOB S LADDER expecting more of the same though the Phantom would have difficulty understanding why anyone would want more of the same will be disappointed JACOB S LADDER needs a little time and space to develop in its own way and at its own pace but the Phantom thinks that phans who see it and are willing to accept its sometimes illogical twists and turns will be pleasantly surprised And phans who enjoyed BRAIN DEAD will almost assuredly enjoy JACOB S LADDER for there but for the grace of a major studio and 20 million dollars is something very similar to Charles Beaumont s glorious Twilight Zone like script Good psychological horror films are so few and far between that the Phantom urges phans to see JACOB S LADDER while they wait for the giant rats to leave and MISERY to arrive When Chucky returns this Friday for a rehash of the very clever and original CHILD S PLAY the Phantom will be in attendance laughing and throwing popcorn with the rest of the audience But he probably won t be scared or disturbed or even very intrigued JACOB S LADDER was able to do all of these things with remarkable skill and so the Phantom recommends it very highly indeed
0843,Henry & June,1990,Take these comments with a grain of salt Films about people s sex and love lives somehow just do not appeal to me even from excellent filmmakers such as Woody Allen or Philip Kaufman I rate them much lower than other people seem to Not that sex itself cannot be interesting but even a Woody Allen agonizing over why he cannot bed Diane Keaton is for me the formula for a total yawner Philip Kaufman s last film THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING while much in this genre did have enough substance besides the sexual maneuvering that it held my interest His current HENRY AND JUNE is a long film but not nearly as long as it seems In spite of the title the film is mostly about Anais Nin and her early 1930s affair with Henry Miller The film is based on the account in her memoir of the same title She makes herself out to be small and in some ways strong but in most ways she is fragile She is not entirely satisfied by her banker husband Hugo and is attracted to virile American writer Henry Miller Awakened by his presence she proceeds in her frail sensitive way to have sex with everyone in reach but the housemaid and perhaps the dog though the dog wasn t talking She also has a stimulating intellectual relationship with Miller who is straight laced enough to limit his sexual partners to only the members of the opposite sex within reach When one of them is not making love he or she is agonizing writing books or riding bicycles Most of the story is told in Nin s voice which is an acquired taste like candied violets The camera adopts a soft focus to mirror her writing style One set apparently near the house where much of the action happens is a long walkway next to a wall in night and fog It looks very much like an impressionist painting I was hoping we would see it in the daytime or at least without fog but we never do I remember no other fog in the film and it is there apparently mostly for effect Kaufman underscores that most of what we are seeing is from Nin s point of view by having one sequence be a flashback narrated by Miller The soft focus is banished and the prose changes to a hard boiled Raymond Chandler style Even in Nin s style Fred War may be trying to affect Miller s character but it comes out like Humphrey Bogart Maria de Medeiros Nin is a dictionary illustration for demure and often also for naked Kaufman has created a tremendous number of nude positions for couples in which the parts that would be most busy are out of sight perhaps trying for an R rating or perhaps affecting Anais Nin s point of view Of course the film got first an X rating and then inaugurated the NC 17 rating June refers incidentally to Miller s wife played by Uma Thurman who usually is not around The film is constantly melodramatic with deep people feeling deep emotions which we are told about cheaply and superficially You know you re in trouble when characters start voicing lines like Does she think she can love anything in you I haven t loved Even if these are real people these people aren t real My rating 1 on the 4 to 4 scale It might have been lower but for the peculiar background created of Paris in the 1930s
0844,Childs Play 2,1990,This year horror phans missed three expected installments in three lengthy sequel fests that had been passing themselves off as original horror entertainment for the better part of the eighties FRIDAY THE 13TH A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and HALLOWEEN The Phantom had hoped that this meant that the trend toward the profitable though generally unsatisfying creation of sequel after horror sequel was waning Though nearly a third of the horror films released this year have been sequels of one sort or another most were more or less successful extensions of ideas that had been explored years ago For example though THE EXORCIST III is most certainly a sequel it doesn t simply rehash the original s story in a brazen attempt to bilk more money out of loyal horror phans The same is true for the other half dozen or so horror sequels that were released this past year In BASKET CASE 2 Frank Henenlotter used the same characters from his shoe string budgeted cult classic but the film is otherwise quite original it doesn t simply rehash the original story differing only in the intensity of the special effects and the size of the budget In that sense these sequels were more welcome than the cheaply made near serials starring Michael and Jason and even Freddy in his later years While the Phantom almost always enjoys an original film more than he does a sequel there is no doubt that some of the best horror films have been either remakes or sequels Unfortunately CHILD S PLAY 2 isn t one of them even though it is very entertaining in its own right But this really shouldn t come as much surprise The original CHILD S PLAY was somewhat of a phenomenon between Don Mancini s clever script and Tom Holland s skillful direction audiences barely blinked an eye at the thought of a small battery operated freckle faced serial killer in cute little overalls And though the film itself wasn t completely original it had obvious origins in the TV film TRILOGY OF TERROR in which a tiny voodoo doll terrorized Karen Black a number of Twilight Zone episodes and Stuart Gordon s excellent DOLLS it was different enough from the countless more or less standardized horror films of the time to gain a huge audience Since then other copy cat films like PUPPETMASTER have tried to capitalize on what turned out to be the most successful mass market concept in horror since Freddy debuted in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET over six years ago but none have been as good as original or as successful Of course one of the biggest things that CHILD S PLAY had going for it was that it was simply so audacious Horror phans had seen unstoppable men in hockey masks they d seen vengeful adolescents celebrating everything but Groundhog s Day with a killing spree they d even seen the wisecracking Freddy dispatch dozens of photogenic teens in dozens of interesting ways But what they hadn t seen was a killer birthday present a child s worst nightmare come true And because Tom Holland did such a wonderful job with the idea people weren t really concerned that a three foot tall red haired doll really shouldn t be able to pose that much of a threat to Andy the child who owned him let alone all the adults he dispatched with curious ease Holland and Mancini did such a good job in fact that audiences let out barely a giggle at the sight of Chucky launching himself like a gymnast at some unsuspecting adult wrapping his arms as far around that adult s neck as they would go and then kicking his little plastic legs so wildly that the adult would be all but unable to keep from falling out a window tripping over a strategically placed piece of furniture and cracking his head open or falling on some sharp kitchen implement that just so happened to be out of the knife rack Mancini s script for CHILD S PLAY also had a great deal of wit and this too helped the film immeasurably The subtext to CHILD S PLAY that of a small child who knows something is true yet can t get an adult to believe him is a common one in children s stories and it s a theme with which even those in the audience over the age of seven can identify It s very different from the standard teenager runs to the Crystal Lake police babbling about an unstoppable maniac in a hockey mask the very fact that Chucky is Andy s friend to the end and that that friend would then turn on him and threaten to kill him gave the film the quality of a fairy tale that had turned into a nightmare That intelligence can be seen in other aspects of the film as well Chucky generally killed people in believable ways though as in all horror films logic must occasionally take a back seat to action and suspense and the focus of much of the film was Andy rather than Chucky making the resemblance to a fairy tale even more pronounced Holland and Mancini purposefully made the first half of the film more like an episode of the Twilight Zone than a horror film it s not until well into CHILD S PLAY that Chucky finally speaks and starts acting like the self possessed doll that he is Before that point Chucky is no more than another Good Guy doll albeit one that goes back into the living room and watches the Nine O Clock News after he was put to bed Seen in this context it is easier to understand why the film was a sleeper hit and why even adults who would not ordinarily go out of their way to see a horror film went to see CHILD S PLAY just as they had gone to THE EXORCIST THE OMEN and FATAL ATTRACTION before it But this is the fundamental problem with CHILD S PLAY 2 although there are a good number of wonderful and witty touches scattered throughout the film and although the sequel s director John Lafia who co wrote the original is more than competent enough to do the story justice the film feels more like an early eighties slash and trash flick than anything else And that is why CHILD S PLAY 2 though enjoyable is a bit of a disappointment The Phantom should explain since the feeling he got was a subtle one and he wouldn t want to be misunderstood certainly CHILD S PLAY 2 bares little resemblance to FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI or MY BLOODY VALENTINE But the film s orientation is very different than was that of the original The focus of the film is no longer Andy and the cruel joke of a killer birthday present has already been played out In short the wonderful duality of the original a child s knowledge vs adult disbelief and a good guy turned bad guy is gone In its place are two signature features of the slash and trash flick endless scenes of stupid people doing stupid things in the dark never thinking of calling the police or simply running for their lives and the classic denouement featuring the last living teenage girl being stalked by a homicidal maniac while she bumps into the carefully hidden bodies of her dead friends Chucky killed a few couple of people in the original but that was never the focus of the film Unfortunately in CHILD S PLAY 2 it is A related problem is that CHILD S PLAY 2 has a relatively high TOTAL B quotient Related to the SLC Spring Loaded Cat quotient a standard measure of horror and adventure film quality the Turn On The Light Bitch quotient is usually highest in horror films that are written and directed by people whose real talents apparently lie elsewhere Like the SLC quotient the TOTAL B quotient was made an art form by Ridley Scott in his superb ALIEN a film in which nearly every single scare and thrill came because someone stumbled into the monster while searching for a troublesome cat in the dark Scott is of course an acknowledged master of the form but in lesser hands a high level of both quotients indicates a film on which little thought has been expended and on upon which little time has been spent To its credit however CHILD S PLAY 2 is really a cut above the usual slash and trash trash even though it is a cut well below its predecessor One reason is that Brad Dourif has a field day with Chucky he played the Lakeshore Strangler in the original as well as the voice of the evil Chucky since in the sequel Chucky is evil from the opening scene Dourif doesn t quite top his performance in THE EXORCIST III but given the constraints of his role in CHILD S PLAY 2 he gives Chucky a memorable and marketable personality It s also obvious that Mancini and Lafia did nearly as well with the film as they could given the constraints of the premise Now that it is no longer possible to generate suspense about whether or not Chucky is alive and no possibility of repeating the wonderful scene in the original in which Andy s mother discovers that Chucky s batteries are still in his box the filmmakers have to rely on humor and more traditional horror themes an uncomfortable compromise at best It s the film s humor that really saves it for all of its slash and trash trappings there is really quite a lot of humor in CHILD S PLAY 2 much more than there was in the original and it helps make up for the film s unfortunate lack of originality Phans of the original and of horror films in general will be especially happy to discover that there is another scene that plays like a homage to Stanley Kubrick s horror classic THE SHINING phans who want details should write to the Phantom since he does not want to spoil these wonderful touches in either film And just when it seems that the film is going to bog down in the worst cliches of the genre that of a homicidal killer stalking a pretty teenage girl the film moves to a very well done denouement inside the Good Guys factory Some reviewers have commented on the unlikely layout of the factory but to the Phantom it seemed perfectly natural and to be frank if the thought of a three foot tall killer doll doesn t seem unlikely it s not clear why the Good Guys factory should disturb reviewers so the very fact that it s located in Chicago rather than Taiwan should signal the audience that there s something supernatural about it Sadly it is only then as the film ends that the filmmakers are able to recapture some of the original s irony and it is only then that CHILD S PLAY 2 shows signs that but for a unique gimmick it is not an entirely standard horror film And the story itself this is a first for the Phantom 1800 words and not a mention of what the film is about It s not bad again given the constraints of the premise Chucky s head is recovered from Andy s apartment by Good Guys technicians and for reasons not entirely clear restored to a new body The president of the company wants to be sure that the doll couldn t have malfunctioned in some way talk about product liability suits and this is all fine and well except that the doll was burnt to a crisp and literally blown apart by the end of the original But OK it s just the same old same old from the illogical world of the horror sequel and nothing to get too concerned about Of course Chucky magically comes back to life and once again the spirit of the Lakeshore Strangler has to find Andy so that he won t be trapped in Chucky s body for all eternity or at least until everyone tires of Chucky sequels Find him he does in the process killing a good number of people in interesting and unlikely ways Andy s new foster parents don t of course believe that Andy s doll is alive and looking for him and neither does his soon to be heroic foster sister but after a while it doesn t really matter any more since the belief non belief question becomes moot everyone who might have been convinced that Chucky was really alive is eventually killed It s really this more than anything else that makes much of CHILD S PLAY 2 feel like a fairly standard horror film though one with a fun gimmick and a sense of style But unlike the original in which Chucky tossed Dinah Manoff out the window in the sequel it s logic that is similarly done away with and while the film s veneer of humor covers most of the problems this causes the sheer number of unlikely things that happen in the film including an awful lot of the killings started bothering the Phantom about half way through But if you don t go expecting the originality and style of CHILD S PLAY and if you don t mind a plot straight out of any of hundred slash and trash horror films of the mid eighties the Phantom thinks you ll find CHILD S PLAY 2 quite enjoyable It s not very original but it is usually fairly clever And it s always enjoyable See it with somewhat reduced expectations and with a rowdy audience and the Phantom thinks that you should have a fine time with the new Jasonized version of Chucky Who knows Maybe in a year or two Chucky will knock Robert Englund off as the reigning king of the horror serial after all we horror phans need our Indy Joneses and Luke Skywalkers just like everyone else

0846,Ladri di saponette,1989,One of the most entertaining and imaginative movies I ve seen in a quite a while This is an Italian comedy which slickly combines a spoof of television with an homage to the 1949 classic Italian movie THE BICYCLE THIEF There are several stories intertwined 1 The story of a film director played by Maurizio Nichetti who also wrote and directed whose dramatic film called The Icicle Thief is being shown on television The film starts out as he arrives at the TV studio to be interviewed by a pompous film critic before the film is to be shown The behind the scenes antics at the studio are almost slapstick 2 As the movie starts to be shown on the TV station we switch to it and watch the beginning of what seems to be a typical Italian post World War II tear jerker about a man also played by Nichetti who can t find a job his starstruck wife their small son who has to work in a gas station to help support the family and a baby who s constantly ignored while he narrowly avoids one disaster after another a running gag throughout the movie At the most melodramatic points in the story the movie is interrupted for some inane but hilarious commercials As the director gets more and more outraged at the way the TV station is destroying his masterwork the commercials seem to come even faster We switch back and forth between the movie the commercials the studio and the living room and before we know it the characters from the commercials start interacting with the characters from the movie It doesn t take long until the characters in the movie are dealing with all new problems introduced by the commercial and vice versa The director watches in horror as a whole new plot unfolds before his eyes and before long he too enters the action of the movie to try to get it back on course This is a movie made with intelligence care and wit There are many clever touches and special effects as the characters interact Pay attention to all the details or you ll miss some of the gags If you re sick of gangster movies check this out Highest recommendation Postscript After this movie played in Italy the government passed a law limiting the number of commercial interruptions in movies broadcast on TV
0847,Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress The,1944,This year s MEMPHIS BELLE directed by Michael Caton Jones is a popular film describing the last mission of the first B 17 to complete its assigned twenty five missions What has not been mentioned anywhere is that MEMPHIS BELLE is a partial remake of a previous film called THE MEMPHIS BELLE The original was directed by one of Hollywood s great directors William Wyler who directed such films as MRS MINIVER THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES THE DESPERATE HOURS THE BIG COUNTRY BEN HUR and FUNNY GIRL After he completed MRS MINIVER Wyler enlisted in the Army Air Corps only to be assigned to make documentaries about the day to day business of the Army Air Corps He made two one was THUNDERBOLT and one was THE MEMPHIS BELLE The latter was bout the B 17 crews stationed in England who bombed Germany and used as a focal point the last mission of the Memphis Belle The Discovery Channel on cable just happens to be running Wyler s MEMPHIS BELLE this month The following paragraph will include some spoilers about the 1990 movie Wyler apparently went on several bombing missions to create the documentary though he has what is at best only a minute or so of footage from the Belle s final flight and that is from the landing and taken from the ground The 1990 films seems to have much exaggerated the danger of the final mission The following are apparently inaccuracies of the later film In the original most of the planes are not named for or illustrated with pictures of sexy women More common are names like Old Bill The nose paintings usually show cartoons of nasty things happening to a frightened looking Hitler The Wyler documentary is worth seeing and makes a worthwhile supplement to the movie After the documentary there are interviews with crew members who flew the B 17s The contention is made that this is one of the best designed planes ever built Every architectural element has a backup so if it were shot away the backup takes over The planes could be horribly shot up and still be in good flying condition as both versions of the film showed A German flier is quoted as saying that attacking a B 17 was like making love to a porcupine on fire
0848,Rocky V,1990,ROCKY V Sylvester Stallone writer Michael S Glick Executive Producer has gotten a lot of press as the last of the ROCKY movies It is certainly one of the best After ROCKY Best Picture Best Director Best Editing 1976 Academy Awards none of the sequels really had the same kind of feel about them After seeing ROCKY V the reason becomes clear ROCKY V is directed by John G Avildsen who has not directed another ROCKY since ROCKY I Mr Avildsen has the ability to direct people so gently and to direct action so forcefully that the effect on the audience is quite stirring Mr Stallone s new found love for comedy is also evident in this film ROCKY V starts where ROCKY IV left off which has been the case in all of the ROCKY films Rocky Sylvester Stallone has just finished knocking out the Russian boxer killer and flys home to meet the press and face his next challenge The first thing one notices hearing Rocky talk is that dumb sounding slurring voice that we have all come to know Only this time it is noticeably dumber sounding as are the things Rocky says What we eventually find out is that Rocky has sustained damage to his brain which will prevent him from ever being licensed to fight again in the United States This is a similar problem to one found in ROCKY II in which doctors tell Rocky that he will never be able to fight again without risking blindness Somehow though director Avildsen really makes us believe that this will be the end of Rocky as a boxer To make matters worse a crooked accountant has lost all of Rocky s money and house and leaves him destitute If not for the pleading and crying of Rocky s wife Adrian Talia Shire he would have immediately gone back in to the ring probably risking his life Rocky must retire and dedicate himself to figuring out a way to support his wife and son Rocky Jr Sage Stallone Rocky Jr is now of grade school age and will have to move back to the projects of Philadelphia Eventually Rocky meets up with a young fighter from Oklahoma named Tommy Gunn Tommy Morrison who wants Rocky to train him to be a heavyweight contender This movie is about the conflicts between all of these characters a Don King type fight promoter named George W Duke Richard Gant and Rocky s strong desire to get back in to the ring so that he can give his family the life they deserve ROCKY V marks the serious acting debut of both Sage Stallone and Tommy Morrison Sage is one of two of Sylvester Stallone s sons by ex wife Sasha Stallone After seeing his performance in this film there is no question that we will be seeing him again His natural talent for acting could be described as better than his father s Perhaps it is due to the fact that he is playing a character who has many similarities to himself Tommy Morrison was chosen to play the part of Tommy Gunn solely based on his ability as a boxer not as an actor After seeing the film I do not think that this was a good risk His acting could not be described as much better than poor and it is tough not to laugh when he speaks For those of you who do not like rap music be prepared to sit through a couple of long raps during action scenes It s a lot different from the Rocky Theme or Frank Stallone Jr or Survivor all music from previous ROCKYs A closing credits song by Elton John is sure to get a lot of airplay from this movie Background music is still done by Bill Conti Burt Young returns to play his role of Paulie He seems right at home returning to the slums and pulls no punches in trying to bring Rocky to reality I found myself really feeling for Rocky for the entire movie His situation is both believable and moving As in all sequels I walked in thinking This had better be the last one But as in all ROCKY sequels except maybe ROCKY IV which I viewed as terrible I walked out thinking Another one wouldn t be that bad
0849,Rocky V,1990,Capsule Review Rocky due to his brother in law s financial mismanagement his wealth and returns to his old neighborhood He is also forced by medical problems resulting from boxing to retire from fighting while promoters clamor for more fights This is a nice change from the monolithic juggernaut of the last three films and a return to the kind of characterization that made the first film great A bit heavy handed at times it still pleases and wonder of wonders surprises from time to time Many of the best stories I have read or seen on film have been variations on the test tube model of plotting take some chemicals or characters throw them together in a test tube and see what happens The more reactive and volatile the chemicals or the characters the better Stories which follow this model usually follow one of two paths a slice of life path which shows realisticly what would happen to such characters in such a situation at a realistic pace or a hyperbolic path in which events which would realistically occur over a span of years take only a few weeks or even a few hours and in which characters motivations are amplified to a level approaching parody This film follows the second of these two paths The problems facing the Balboa Clan as they move back into the original seedy neighborhood they originally left behind are predictable Less physical comforts neighbor fans constantly hanging around Rocky s kid who now has to attend the local public school facing harassment by the neighborhood bad boys These are all present and they are not done especially realistically The kids in this seedy neighborhood of Philly for example are all white and the worst vices they seem to have acquired are cigarette smoking and having pierced ears The image of Philly s bad neighborhood seems to be a gentle one pre desegregation and pre crack There is an extra complication however Tommy Gunn a young boxer from Oklahoma he looks oh so farmboy too who idolizes Rocky and has come to Philly to seek him out and receive the wisdom of this boxing guru Rocky seeing a chance at vicarious re attainment of greatness takes Tommy under his wing to train him while neglecting his son who desperately needs the kind of fatherly support Rocky bestows to Tommy Themes of fatherhood parental neglect and juvenile rebellion are raised here but the situations that come up in a matter of weeks seem to be the kind that in real life occur over years This however does not detract from the power of this side of the movie The questions raised here are dealt with neither delicately nor subtlely but neither are they dismissed with platitudinous responses or excessive exposition On the technical side this movie uses to full effect the kind of imagery the Rocky films have been built on sweeping montages images of faces in the crowd Adrienne saying Rocky s name and of course punches punches punches seen from every angle and with blood on the mat to spare The film however also takes advantage of Rocky s brain damage to use some surreal imagery of Rocky s previous fight with Ivan Drago as well as some reminiscences of Mickey Rocky s old trainer played once again by the wonderful Burgess Meredith This is in fact the most nostalgic of the Rocky movies looking back on them with fond memories As Rocky prepares to move into the old neighborhood he doffs his old hat from the old days when he was muscle for a loan shark Adrienne returns to work at the pet store where she originally met Rocky Rocky returns to work at the gym where it all started In many ways this movie is like going home after a rather tasteless digression into world politics and several boring rehashes of the old question of the immovable object and the unstoppable force It is especially pleasing to note that even within ten minutes of the end I wasn t sure how the film would end this film unlike the others does not have the sunny Reagan Era Stallone who uttered such lines as Go for it Stallone seems to have upon entering the 90s reflected some upon his own mortality the transience of wealth and some of the simpler pleasures of life
0850,Texasville,1990,Below are a number of short reviews comments of movies I have seen in the first week of the London Film Festival I have no idea what the distribution of any of these films is likely to be last year I saw Icicle Thief in the festival and it has just appeared both in the US and UK I have tried to give a rating on the 4 to 4 scale as used elsewhere Anyway here goes in the order I saw them last week The sequel to THE LAST PICTURE SHOW opened the London Film Festival The movie picks up 30 years on and shows the state that the characters have got themselves into I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought that the small town farce that was played out was exquisite 3 This is the first feature by Alfonso Arandia and is the story of a failed exam and a not so anonymous letter stolen mail boxes like the large red ones we have in London but yellow and an underworld sub plot An enjoyable if rather silly movie that reminds me of my youth though I never lugged a letter box up 5 flights of stairs 1 A fascinating and beautifully crafted film that intertwines the lust for money and the serenity of the Vermeers in the Met The movie is remarkably well paced especially considering that Jon Jost told us after the screening that the entire film was improvised though well rehearsed This is Jon s fist film in 35mm and looks excellent it shows what can be done filming entirely on location with no additional lights 2 5 JU DOU SECRET LOVE HIDDEN FACES Dir Zhang Yi Mou and Yeng Feng Liang Chinese Japanese collaboration that is set in China in the 1920s around a dye factory and its owner wife and nephew The young wife falls for the nephew and we are taken through his seduction and the consequences over 10 years Beautifully shot and very colourful 1 5 The poignant tale of a young man returning to his village after two years away to discover that his promised bride is married to his father The ensuing problems with their love and its fulfillment make enjoyable watching even if the culture that we are seeing is completely alien to the western view of things 1 5 This Russian tale of two youngsters growing up in a remote mining town near Vladivostock in 1947 was an unexpected delight As such the tale doesn t sound promising but the resulting movie is a touching and beautiful tale of young innocence in a harsh world 3 This true Hungarian tale about a young boy who shoots his father while his mother is in hospital and continues life as before The story of this true incident is well told and cinematically very interestingly portrayed with a variety of B W film qualities used to signify different time frames Unfortunately it comes across as someone trying very hard to tell a story in visual terms and not quite succeeding 0 This brilliant movie tells a fictionalised account of a your German girl in Bavaria who tries to write an essay on My home town during the third Reich The story is well told combining pseudo documentary style recreations of the past and stylized scenes from the story The film is based on a true story and is fascinating to realise the level of cover up that took place after the last war and realise that we should never forget what happened Usually movies portray people larger than life in this case and the real Nasty Girl who was at the screening came across as even larger than the fictional character portrayed in the movie 3 5 Well this has been reviewed to extinction on the net so my very short comment would be that I enjoyed the film but can understand why it might be thought a pretentious load of drivel it is not main stream cinema in many ways and its tarring with the NC 17 certificate has given Universal a chance to hype the film into something it isn t a sexually charged erotic movie 2 This Hong Kong movie takes a splash of Indiana Jones and mixes with a dash of Chinese history and creates a delightful movie with some very nice touches Without giving too much away the movie tells a delightful love story through the turmoil of the plot and some spectacular sword fights that make the should have been legendary sword fight from Raiders seem tame well I can t imagine Harrison Ford doing the balletic dancing technique that the Chinese go in for 2 Based on the life of Juana Ines de la Cruz a 17th Century Nun in Mexico this film tells of her persecution by the church and her friendship with the Viceroy of Mexico and his wife A marvelously constructed world is created in the movie through a limited selection of sets that a reworked but highly minimal This movie is quite hard work and relatively slow but I now want to know more about Juana Ines de la Cruz now considered one of the great Spanish poets of the 17th century so the evening was not wasted 0 5 This excellent adaptation of Rostand s classic play is completely enchanting Gerard Depardieu was born to play Cyrano and he is brilliant in the part and yet still believable in the more romantic moments Anne Brochet Roxanne is also excellent and the whole production is well worth seeing The French dialogue is said without sounding too silly and the English translation has been done by Antony Burgess All together excellent 3 5 If anyone would like more information on any of the movies listed then I email me and I will see what I can do More films next week
0851,Reversal of Fortune,1990,This movie is based on Alan Dershowitz s book about his defense of Claus von Bulow who had been convicted of attempting to kill his rich socialite wife Sunny with a large injection of insulin that put her into a permanent vegetative state Dershowitz is a prominent law prof at Harvard who writes a syndicated column on constitutional legal and liberal issues for the New York Times The movie is narrated by Glenn Close whose character Sunny is already in the final coma of her life she is alive today This is a permanent stumbling block for the movie I m never very comfortable with a voice over movies ought not to need narrators And a out of body narrator is really pushing the limits Jeremy Irons turns in an astonishing performance as the chimeric von Bulow Ron Silver as Dershowitz says to Irons You re a very weird man And Irons as von Bulow replies You have no idea It is the kind of strange and eerie characterization of an unknowable character that leaves one gasping in admiration and wondering where in the name of all that s cinematic did Irons get the clue the resource the insight the starting point in creating such a very weird man Silvers Dershowitz is never explained to us We get a some defining scenes and speeches about his role as a man wild about law and protecting the poor and the innocent even the defense of von Bulow is seen as a way of keeping the poor from being victimized by the rich for an explanation of this seek elsewhere but these are templates of the standard liberal Jewish lawyer His Jewishness is featured prominently throughout the movie by the way Not quite a stereotype however Through the early parts of the movie I feared that Close who is one of my personal faves was not going to get a chance to act However through the miracle of flashbacks she got a couple of chances to remind once again how very good she is The pleasure and perhaps purpose of REVERSAL OF FORTUNE is the wonderful acting The problem other than the narrative is that the movie is terribly schizophrenic Half of it a legal procedures movie not unlike PRESUMED INNOCENT for example Part of it is a character study Very little is a whodunit Since this is a true story and all the principals are real and living this last aspect had to be treated I imagine with some circumspection Oh yes and it s rather funny in many places but the newspapers ads calling it a comedy are probably a fall back marketing strategy It ain t a comedy
0852,Dances with Wolves,1990,Lieutenant John Dunbar Kevin Costner secures a position as head of a garrison on the remote edge of the frontier smack in the middle of Sioux territory He got this post and his buckskin Cisco through an impulsive act of suicide that was interpreted as heroism The garrison is deserted but rather than turn back Dunbar unloads the provisions begins cleaning the debris drifts into a daily routine and starts keeping a journal For roughly one third of the film the journal serves as the device that justifies Dunbar s narrative We hear his written words we see the pictures he draws Through the narrative we begin to see the man He is quiet he is unperturbed by isolation he is content He is unaware that his movements are watched by the neighboring Sioux he s also unaware that other whites have been murdered by Indians In a break from the narrative pattern we switch point of view and sit in on a Sioux pow wow held to discuss Dunbar s invasion into their territory Soon we switch point of view again this time riding on a children s raid Object Cisco This vignette is a wonderful set of scenes that does much to further character development and entertain us at the same time Looking back it s one of the most satisfying parts of the film It works well because it s on a human scale and it portrays human foibles Gradually and I mean gradually Dunbar meets and interacts with the Sioux In parallel Dunbar befriends a lone wolf Those of us who yearn for multiple levels in a film gladly recognize this wolf as symbolic of Dunbar s developing relationship with the tribe And the tribe sees Dunbar s antics with the wolf as proving that Dunbar is more than a white man since wolves are revered in Sioux culture My limited understanding is that wolves are spiritual and honoring a man with a name that includes wolf is a great honor indeed Dunbar becomes Dances with Wolves A key event in the film is the buffalo hunt What a scene I d read earlier that the cast actually rode in a stampeding herd of 3 500 buffalo but that didn t clue me in on the primal nature of the hunt that shows so clearly in this scene The theatre I saw this in had a THX sound system which provides an immediacy that can t be described easily Dunbar plays a pivotal role in the hunt and the tribe adopts him unreservedly Incidentally Costner had a spectacular fall during this scene yet refused to let a stuntman ride for him and even took the stuntman s horse in order to get back in the scene Up to this point the film develops in a leisurely fashion mirroring the slow way that Dunbar becomes integrated into the tribe Although some critics felt the movie was slooooow the pace seemed appropriate and even comfortable to me What s lacking is much deeper than a pacing problem The idea of a white man adopted into a tribe is alluring but insufficient material for real drama Another layer is required conflict Not just a battle scene type of conflict but the gut type conflict take a half white half Indian and pull on both sides Make him want both make him see flaws in both put him in conflict If you don t have conflict you don t have drama That s what s wrong with this film The whites are portrayed as such barbarians and the Sioux as such noble humans that Dunbar never has moments of doubt Why should he Instead of Dunbar being pulled in two directions the medicine man is the one who has to weigh both sides and make the telling decision in the film That is so very very wrong Oh the movie is beautiful and worth seeing but it s a soft film that ultimately falters and fades There are at least three ways that this film violates good filmmaking shifting points of view the central character s lack of conflict and an ending that happens before the characters see the results of their actions To his credit Costner stuck by his guns getting Lakotah and Pawnee dialects into the film with English subtitles It was an important decision that worked well The Sioux communities are delighted with Costner they ve accepted him into their tribe Also to Costner s credit is the length of the movie that he insisted on which befits the nature of the material Another plus is the cinematography which is often breathtaking The acting is acceptable and occasionally is much better than that It s a good Western in summary but it s not a great or important film Go see it in a good theatre with a good sound system so you can enjoy the things it does well Its flaws will be too apparent and the grandeur lost if you wait to see it on a VCR
0853,Dances with Wolves,1990,Capsule review Epic portrait of a Sioux tribal life as seen through the eyes of a Civil War officer American Indians have rarely or never been portrayed so believably and sympathetically Its biggest flaw is that the White Man does not seem as realistically portrayed The films resembles WHITE DAWN and FAREWELL TO THE KING in plot and spirit Rating high 2 4 to 4 I suspect that of all the films of 1989 the one that will be best remembered will be GLORY It may not be the best film of 1989 but it has a sort of timeless quality that will hold up for many years That was 1989 This year I think we have an even better film that has that same timeless quality There have been films in the past that have tried to give sympathetic views of the American Indian It is not hard to be more sympathetic than films like FORT APACHE LITTLE BIG MAN unaccountably popular attempted to be sympathetic but gave the impression that the writers knew nothing about American Indians I do not know if the novel was as bad or not Other films such as CHEYENNE AUTUMN tried to speak of injustices done to the Indians but they too never got into the minds of native Americans Perhaps DANCES WITH WOLVES based on the novel by Michael Blake is no more authentic than is LITTLE BIG MAN but it certainly feels like the most authentic film ever made about American Indian culture Kevin Costner directs and stars as John Dunbar who is to have his leg amputated due to wounds in a Civil War battle Not having the courage to face his future he attempts suicide and in doing so accidentally makes himself a hero This not only wins him medical care sufficient to save his leg he is also given his choice of posting Wishing to see the Western frontier before it is overrun by the white man he requests a posting to an isolated and deserted fort far out on the frontier His thoughts about facing hostile animals and more hostile Sioux are overcome by his curiosity and his willingness to accept and appreciate that which is alien to him The film picks up his enthusiasm to meet understand and befriend the very alien culture of the neighboring Sioux He must first overcome their distrust There the storyteller somewhat unrealistically contrives circumstances in Dunbar s favor This is a long film and each stage of his acceptance by the Sioux is shown and not overly glossed over In particular language problems are quite believably difficult and eventually overcome by another contrivance Eventually Dunbar is accepted into the Sioux society and Costner can show us how Sioux lived and thought If the film has a major weakness it is that it exaggerates the stupidity and strangeness even if not the cruelty of the hordes of invading white men The positive view of the Sioux would be more believable if the view of the White Man had more credibility There is a love story of Dunbar with a white woman who has been Sioux since she was captured as a child This subplot could have been a distraction from showing us the Sioux lifestyle but if so it was only a minor one Mary McDonnell familiar from MATEWAN plays Dunbar s lover interest Stands with a Fist DANCES WITH WOLVES is told with a grace and humor that keeps the viewer constantly entertained through its nearly three hour length Costner is to be congratulated for creating such an unorthodox film about a quarter us in Lakota the Sioux language and subtitled and at the same time so enjoyable a film his first time directing I give it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0854,Jacobs Ladder,1990,The following is probably only for people seriously obsessed with JACOB S LADDER and definitely only for people who have seen the movie If you re afraid of dying and you re holdin on you ll see devils tearin your life away But if you ve made your peace then the devils are really angels freein you from the world It all depends on how you look at it For me these words spoken by Louie Danny Aiello and paraphrasing Meister Eckhart are at the heart of the movie Bruce Joel Rubin writer and associate producer sets up the story in such a way that we need only accept two relatively tame ideas in order to accept the movie as a whole First dreams can seem real enough to be confused with reality and second very long dream time can take place in very short real time Though this may give Rubin and Adrian Lyne director a Teflon shovel by allowing them to simply attribute any inconsistency to the inconsistent nature of dreams I d argue that they don t include anything in the film unworthy of serious consideration and analysis Most reviews I ve read throw out references to An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge as if to say Rubin s idea is unoriginal Many Shakespearean plays involve a confusion of dreams and reality A MIDSUMMER NIGHT S DREAM for example and since Shakespeare stole almost all his plots maybe originality shouldn t be the issue Good artists borrow great artists steal Rubin like Shakespeare may simply be taking an idea that oft was thought But n er so well expressed While flashbacks have long been standard fare in literature and film the one aspect of Owl Creek that might be considered original is its use of flash forward William Golding Nobel Prize in Literature 1983 uses a similar technique in his novel FREE FALL The main character in Golding s novel is only alive for a few minutes during an unsuccessful parachute jump From the moment he realizes his chute won t open the book becomes a flash forward in the mind of the protagonist similar to Owl Creek Suffice it to say that these ideas have been around and the question remains what do Rubin and Lyne do with them In the book of Genesis Jacob the younger son of Isaac has a vision of a ladder between heaven and earth on which angels ascend and descend With a single biblical phrase Rubin sets up the major premise of the movie We re stuck on earth we won t be here forever where do we go next and how do we get there Again Rubin s not the first to use this metaphor but since Calvin s references to Jacob s Ladder seldom involve LSD this could be a new angle on an old symbol The Ladder may just be our ticket from here to eternity but to eternal what The hippie chemist s ladder takes us straight down to the primal fear the base anger while Gabe s staircase at the end of the movie seems to have a brighter destination With this dichotomy in place the trick seems to be to be able to tell the difference between up and down or heaven and hell since as Louie tells us the devils might really be angels or vice versa depending on how you look at it Since Meister Eckhart and Woody Allen haven t solved this problem we re likely to be sympathetic with Jacob s Tim Robbins predicament Jacob s son Gabe with a name reminiscent of Gabriel the messenger angel seems to wear a white hat after all he s the only son with light hair and the only one without a spherical bloated demonic face He asks Jacob to tuck him in tells him not to go back to bed with Sarah and has Jacob leave the door open a little more Jezebel Elizabeth Pena pretty much wears only black as we might picture her biblical namesake She s a heathen who doesn t go much for church names and tells us that Jacob is with her because he sold his soul for a good lay Faust sells his soul for knowledge while Jacob seems to sell his to be spared knowledge with its pain and responsibility Jezzie is often kind and comforting to Jacob but also seems to have a dark side Following the Who are you scene she tells Jacob he can rot and she s present in the hospital in hell scene even preparing the syringe for his forehead In her last scene with Jacob she pleads with him not to go to talk with the hippie chemist the act which finally allows Jacob to make his peace freeing him from the earth Louie wears white has a bright circular light over his shoulder and looks like an overgrown cherub In fact he looks like an angel as Jacob tells him every time he sees him Louie is the only source of stability and sanity in Jacob s jump cut life He goes to Louie when things are out of alignment and Louie straightens them out Louie s a life saver and he knows it He even rescues Jacob from the hospital in hell So why is he named for the very first angel to descend the Ladder from heaven to hell Just coincidence I guess You could never convince me that a single name in this script was not considered and reconsidered ad nauseum so that while possible coincidences are rather unlikely as are other chronological and logistical inconsistencies We re willing to believe that Jacob on his deathbed and with the possible assistance of the chemically isolated dark side of LSD BZ if you prefer could invent a believable post Vietnam life for himself In dream time it could last six years or the time between leaving Vietnam and getting a call from Paul Grunigan his similarly spooked battalion buddy What helps me buy post Vietnam life with Jezzie and working at the Post Office is that he might have started working there and met Jezzie before going to Vietnam We know that he spent six years studying for his Ph D and then went to work for the Post Office thereby angering his wife Sarah enough to throw him out What can I tell ya Louie After Nam I just didn t want to think Jacob might have invented Jezzie and the Post Office out of thin air or possibly they were based only on the knowledge that he was having marital trouble with his wife and that when he got back from Vietnam he wanted to find a job where he didn t have to think But if he knew something about working at a Post Office and had at least met Jezzie before Vietnam then his elaboration on these two items into the post Vietnam life he envisions seems more plausible Could he have worked in a Post Office part time to earn a little extra money as a graduate student met Jezzie and then while in Vietnam reflected on the blissful mindlessness of the Post Office The scene in bed with Sarah would then take on the quality of a memory rather than a dream while living with Sarah and working at the Post Office before Vietnam he had had a dream about living with Jezzie or cheated on Sarah in his mind as she puts it a nightmare burning with ice and guilty thoughts Later on during his dying moments in Vietnam he elaborates on his memory of this dream and comes up with the whole post Vietnam dream I admit that this Post Office before Vietnam theory is not wholly satisfying for one thing it takes some of the punch out of that line about not wanting to think after Nam if he d worked at the Post Office before Vietnam presumably for different reasons What I like about this theory though is that it sets up a consistent formula where things from the real world facts events people are used as springboards for Jacob s elaborated dream world For instance sometime before the battle Jacob has considered getting a mindless job after he returns leaving his wife going to see a chiropractor about his back pain and as a philosopher thought about heaven hell and the afterlife These real world thoughts are the fuel for his dream world Even after the battle and Jacob s stabbing elements from the real world enter his dream world Lying on his back staring up at faces from the dance floor of a Brooklyn apartment is like lying on the jungle floor looking up at the faces of his rescuers The disco light shining in his eyes from the apartment ceiling is like the sun in his eyes as he s waiting for and ultimately hoisted up to the helicopter Having a 106 degree fever and going into shock in the bathtub is like the shock and fever he d be likely to experience with an abdominal bayonet wound Being jostled around and beaten up in the car with the D O D goons is like the helicopter ride to the mobile army surgical hospital And finally the circular lamp over the couch in Louie s office is like the surgical lamp over the operating table in the final death scene also like the lamp over the operating table in the hospital in hell scene We re less willing to believe that facts events and people in Jacob s elaborated dream world in 1971 match up with real world facts after 1971 For instance that a real song from circa 1975 Voulez vous coucher avec moi or a real baseball card from circa 1973 Rich Gossage could be part of Jacob s deathbed dream in 1971 Other chronology problems include Gabe writing a letter to Jacob in Vietnam the one Jacob takes out of the cigar box when Jezzie reveals to us that Gabe died before Jacob went to Vietnam The last problem could be explained by something like Jacob shipping off to boot camp receiving the letter from Gabe Gabe dying and Jacob shipping off to Vietnam depending on how far you re willing to stretch things Logistical problems include why was he drafted at all at roughly twenty eight twenty two after college plus six years of graduate school with a wife and two or three kids Why was he only a Private First Class with all his education although the degree in the cigar box was only for a Masters not a Ph D maybe he never finished his Ph D How come the D O D goons who were hassling Jacob and his battalion buddies hadn t hassled or even killed the hippie chemist who knew the whole story and obviously had the most damaging evidence against the army Since the last problem occurs only in the dream world you could argue that it doesn t need to make real world sense The entire scene with the hippie chemist is a little hard to take all at once It s reminiscent of the scene in ANGEL HEART around the boiling cauldron of gumbo where Mickey Rourke is forced to confront similarly painful facts about his past In the ANGEL HEART scene lines like elaborate incantations in Latin and Greek just don t ring true and similarly in JACOB S LADDER lines like it was starting to get ugly in the States Hell you remember and a bad trip and believe me I ve had my share could not compare to the fury of the ladder don t live up to the consistently good dialogue throughout the rest of the movie and tend to sound written rather than spoken The hippie chemist scene was a tough one We had to empathize with the chemist and Jacob and process a lot of information and chronology all in about three minutes Rubin set himself up a monumental task and the degree to which he succeeded is arguable The scenes that follow this one however are even more challenging and here Rubin seems in his element The cab ride Where s your home Sam the doorman Dr Singer It s been a long time the empty apartment teeming with life protractor compass apple pie and television snow the thunder storm the Sonny Boy melody drifting in from the music box in the hallway and THE SOUND OF SOLAR WINDS all lead up to Jacob s discovery of Gabe at the foot of the stairs Rubin Lyne and Maurice Jarre music all collaborate to create a moment at this reunion of father and son that either crystallizes or shatters everything that came before it As the spiral of Gabe s staircase becomes the spiral of the fluorescent surgical lamp we are either prepared for the final revelation or we re not It worked for me but I can see where some might be lost on the ascent The lights are bright the solar winds loud and the height is dizzying
0855,It,1990,I ll start this review by saying that I am not a horror fan I won t pick up horror books unless I have a recommendation from someone saying that the book is a good book not just a good horror book I am however very fond of Stephen King King transcends the genre writing good novels full of good well drawn characters The novel IT is probably the epic horror novel I chose the word epic deliberately The book has the feel of an epic The actions of the characters feel as if they are a part of something much bigger something very important King uses a number of narrative techniques and extensive foreshadowing to achieve this Before any major action happens you have glimpses of it helping to make the action seem much bigger when it does occur For example there is mention of the apocalyptic rock fight several hundred pages before it actually happens By the time it does the reader knows and feels that it is a pivotal point in what is to happen IT like of all of King s major novels contains well drawn characters By book s end we know the main characters well understand why they do what they do have lived with them through several major choices and so forth Last night ABC presented the first part of a two part novel for television based on IT Actually instead of calling a novel for television they should have called it a Cliff s notes for television since it is as close to the King novel as Cliff s notes are to a novel That is it seemed to portray some of the surface of the book not all by any means A number of important events are left out It does not capture the feel of the book It instead is a pale outline of the book First of all all of the epic proportions of the novel are gone Key scenes the rock fight the first confrontation with it in the sewers are over quickly and seem rather trite They certainly happen too easily There is no real build up to these scenes they just happen Secondly the characters mostly seem shallow there motives unclear This happens a bit with the lucky seven the 7 kids who challenge it and happens even more so with the villains Henry Bowers the main nemesis of the kids starts with murderous instincts unlike in the novel where his descent into evil happens in stages as he crosses barrier after barrier in his criminal behavior His companions aren t really portrayed at all For those who have read the book I was particularly sorry that they left out Patrick Hofstadter sp one of the creepiest characters I ve seen The novel portrays it as an ancient evil something that had come to earth millions of years in the past and fed on and corrupted what would become the town of Derry Maine This comes through almost not at all in the movie The kids see old pictures of Pennywise the clown the chief guise of it and one tells the story of a particularly nasty accident at the town s ironworks This is not enough to really create the feel of ancient menace that the book conveys Moreover the book has some moments of real menace The kids seem in real danger a number of times both when confronting Henry Bowers and his gang and in confronting it in its many forms The teenage werewolf a frightening figure in the book is trivial in the movie for example The movie downplays its shape shifting in any case In summary I m glad I read the book before seeing the movie since the movie would have soured me on the book Will I watch part 2 Yeah probably Although at this point it is more a morbid desire to see how else they are going to butcher things On final note how would it rate if I were taking it on its own merits without reference to the book That s hard to say since I have read the book Probably I d consider it on par with your typical grade C Hammer film like a Christopher Lee Dracula film an OK way to spend two hours at the movie theater but not anything great On Monday I reviewed the first part of the TV movie based on Stephen King s IT At that point I blasted it calling it a Cliff s Notes for Television rather than a Novel for Television The characters were rather shallow and the film just didn t have the scope and epic feel of the novel Part 2 was aired last night It was a bit better The characters were fleshed out a bit though still shallow and the ending didn t seem quite as rushed However many of the problems of the first part still remained First of all it failed to give you the feel of the scope power and age of it It was simply a somewhat nasty monster faced by our characters not the timeless evil it was in the novel The ending while not as rushed as that of part one still seemed a tad too easy Moreover the characters face down it on strictly a physical plain It is a much more intense moment in the book fought primarily on what can best be described here as another plain first by Bill then by Richie whose role is trivial in the film Another problem is that the film tries to bring in devices from the book but without the buildup these things had in the book Thus they are just confusing or trite For example Bill s He thrusts his hands against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts chant builds up to something of mystic significance in the book in part because of King s narrative technique in which Bill remembers this bit by bit In the movie many readers must have been shaking their heads wondering why he was saying such things to the monster at the end Similarly Silver is just Bill s old bike In the novel it is built up in such a way that it seems much much more so that when Bill used it to beat the devil it fits Finally the characters just don t seem to jell the way they do in the book In the book each character is an integral part of the whole Richie for example is NOT just the class clown His joking and his voices are important in the resolution and are part of the synergy of the lucky seven I realize that much of this probably comes from the time constraints If they had 6 or 8 hours rather than 4 they could have done a much better job I certainly would have expected more of William Goldman who is a fine screenwriter However what we wound up with was OK and enjoyable but a pale shadow of what it could have been
0856,Home Alone,1990,I wasn t expecting much going to this film How funny can it be to watch some wild child and his antics around the house while his parents are gone The answer is Not very Oh sure there are some funny moments and some of the situations are amusing but this is definitely a movie that appeals to younger people than me The biggest problems with the film are all the contrived things that appear throughout the show There are also some odd asides that have to be chalked up to let s get a laugh rather than some real need The plot is all too predictable and while there is occasionally some inspiring camera work young Macauly Culkin doesn t really have what it takes to carry a whole movie yet Yes he s funny and he has some great bits but as a whole he just didn t pack it I should mention that as a grown up I didn t really get a kick out of it but if the gales of hysterical laughter coming from about every child in the theater are any clue this movie has gobs and gobs of appeal to the much younger crowd Perhaps they can relate better to some of Kevin s family problems which appeared out of nowhere Rating Take your kids to it but if you don t have any or can t get ahold of some then skip this one It s not trash it s just not great 2 stars on the old 1 to 4 star scale

0859,Rescuers Down Under The,1990,I went to see THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER this weekend and was totally impressed by how wonderful the animation was In characterization and plot tension it wasn t up to the standards of THE LITTLE MERMAID but it was very funny and quite exciting This movie was a showcase of almost every type of animation possible Extensive use of multi plane cameras roto scoping Cody s mother and the rangers and best of all some amazing computer animation By creating computer models of vehicles buildings and backgrounds the animators were allowed a greater degree of freedom With the exception of the opening scenes of Ayer s Rock the message sent around the world and the New York flying scenes all of the computer animation was rotoscoped by the animators so there was no discontinuity between the hand drawn cels and the computer aided cells All you see is amazingly complex full perspective motion McLeach s vehicle has to be seen to be believed Some computer animation was also present in the short feature The Prince and the Pauper notably the snow quite nice and several shots of the King s wagon I m sorry if this has been a strictly technical review so far This is a very good children s movie but I think anyone should enjoy it However if you are cynical or find too many faults in the plot you can always fall back on looking at the pretty pictures THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER is a sequel to THE RESCUERS Duh It is about a young Australian boy named Cody who is kidnapped by the evil poacher McLeach who wants him to reveal where the nest of the giant eagle is located Through the R A S Rescuers Aid Society network Cody s plight is relayed to New York and Bianca Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bernard Bob Newhart are chosen to fly to Australia to rescue him Air travel is courtesy of Wilbur John Candy an albatross brother to Orville of the first film Once in Australia there are aided by Jack John drat voice by Tristan Rogers a cross between Crocodile Dundee and Indiana Jones Along the way they encounter many different Australian animals some animal like and some characterized
0860,Misery,1990,On the negative side William Goldman s script is rather dull and uninspired Stephen King should have written the screenplay The editing is only adequate Some rather cheapo scenes were used The movie definitely wasn t dark and evil enough Sometimes the humour is not in the right place The movie has an overall rushed appearance This does not appear as a Rob Reiner film If you didn t know you certainly wouldn t equate it with his previous works It AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH isn t true to the book There is a lot of rewriting of the interactions between Paul and Annie no good There is a lot of rewriting in of new characters quite well done Annie just doesn t get to do as much of what she did i e gross things in the book They changed the ending The one thing that I was really looking forward to was a good movie Which it is I heartily recommend this to fans I was also looking for an unadulterated transference of the book Which it is not Why can t they leave good enough alone Personally I saw no reason to change what they did although I liked all of the new characters but they didn t allow Annie to let go enough I have to admit I was going with really high expectations Well I figured it s SK s best book and Rob Reiner directing What could be better It came up to all standards for a good movie which it was But it didn t make it to a great movie There are some great scenes especially the hobbling WOW and some good shots esp Annie driving but overall there wasn t enuff to bump it over to the really good or classic level I wouldn t mind seeing someone else try to work this Here goes Kathy Bates Annie she is by far the best thing about the movie I wouldn t be surprised by an Oscar nomination yes she s really that good Malcom McDowell Paul Sheldon Director The Coen Brothers Don t take this too seriously So overall good worth seeing but not the best you re gonna see If you re wondering how I saw this early I got special passes to a preview showing
0861,Misery,1990,Stephen King evidently dislikes writers a great deal In THE SHINING a playwright gets possessed by a maniacal mansion and tries to kill his family In STAND BY ME a young writer wanna be finds a leech sucking blood from his testicles And now in MISERY the latest movie to be adapted from a book of his a popular romance novelist gets in a car wreck and is brutalized by his Number One Fan until he agrees to write the book that she wants him to write The opening scene has Paul Sheldon played by James Caan America s most popular author of dimestore romance books finishing a new book which he has yet to title We see him sitting at his typewriter in a cabin in the woods typing the final sentence of this new book He obviously is proud of himself for writing this novel We can see a lone cigarette a single kitchen match and a bottle of champagne sitting not 20 feet away from him and he gladly partakes of this after penciling THE END on the last page of his manuscript He takes this manuscript puts it in an old leather case and drives off Unfortunately it is snowing quite heavily and his car goes off the road Fortunately or so it seems at the time a rescuer comes and pries him out of the wreckage What follows is not a horror movie Not really What we have is closer to a comedic treatment of a horror movie rather like WHEN HARRY MET SALLY meets THE SHINING Sheldon s Number One Fan played by Kathy Bates turns out to be a nurse who loves his books specifically the only series that he has written for the last 20 years a series with a character named Misery Chastain Sheldon sick of writing romance fiction had decided to kill of the character in the next book which was about to be released But she is also somewhat of an obsessive when she finishes the book containing Misery s death she calls Sheldon a murderer and leaves obviously extremely angry Calming down she tells him that nobody knows that he s with her that everybody thinks that he s dead And with his legs burdened with multiple fractures he cannot walk So she forces him to write a new Misery book one that brings her back to life She forces him to burn the manuscript of the book he had just finished which was evidently his attempt at writing serious fiction In the process of forcing Sheldon to write a new Misery book she mutilates cripples and drugs him all the while telling him I feed you clean you dress you and still no appreciation for me Director Rob Reiner does an excellent job of accenting the humor that was probably very scarce in the original book a feat which he also achieved with STAND BY ME There are few actual scenes of horror throughout the movie merely one or two quite painful scenes that make you shudder with pain along with the characters The acting is also excellent Kathy Bates makes her character of the maniacal nurse from hell quite believable and also makes quite evident the unstated fact in the movie that her character was a graduate of Catholic school James Caan while having a very thankless role is able to go from the usual big tough guys with a soft spot that he usually plays to this quiet superstitious gentle writer who has to get tough in order to survive with this woman Complaints Just how Caan s character gets out of his situation is never made quite clear we are shown one gut wrenching scene and then see him far removed from it a minute later Frances Sternhagen who plays a deputy in the small town where this takes place appears to be nothing but a wasted role But this is really nitpicking the main hate hate relationship between Bates and Caan are what count here and Reiner pulls it off very smoothly
0862,Misery,1990,A Stephen King novel is to literature what a Big Mac a large fries and a Coke are to fine cuisine Both seem like good ideas when you re hungry and both taste great at least to start But after you re done you might feel vaguely dissatisfied and at the very least you ll have an awful lot of paper much of which is strewn with brand names to dispose of And yet and yet Sure you know pretty much what s going to happen from the very first page And sure the characters are comfortable stereotypes the settings are as familiar as the faithful golden arches themselves and the language is post modern campfire ese King even brings back characters and plot devices like Mickey D s brings back McRibs they re never gone long enough for us to really miss them But still Can t get enough of em right Neither can the Phantom who s been a King phan since early on and has yet to read a novel or short story that he didn t like at least a little For the most part though he s liked them quite a lot and he s always eager to flex his eye muscles and his biceps given the physical if not literary heft of King s recent efforts on the latest from America s favorite horror writer An odd way to begin a review of MISERY you might say But the Phantom found as he left the theater that MISERY the film is a lot like one of King s novels Although we never should be surprised by anything that happens we are And although James Caan gives a perfunctory performance as Paul Sheldon we re able to overlook it And finally although we must as the credits roll admit to ourselves that MISERY really isn t much of a horror film we must also admit that it was nonetheless expertly made beautifully photographed and very very enjoyable More than anyone else Rob Reiner seems to have the best idea of what a Stephen King novel feels like When he turned King s short story The Body into STAND BY ME even non King phans stood up and took notice But those who were King phans and who had suffered through countless bad adaptations of his novels rejoiced Here finally was some relief from films like CAT S EYE and MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE especially MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE CHRISTINE GRAVEYARD SHIFT and even to some extent THE SHINING which while it is a fine horror film in its own right bears as much resemblance to a Stephen King novel as Stephen King bears to a competent film director films which bore greater or lesser resemblance to the stories from which they were adapted but which felt nothing at all like them Did the Phantom mention MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE It s that feeling of familiarity that feeling of settling down around a campfire to hear a ripping good yarn and one that you know will keep you awake until the wee hours of the night that is usually missing from the films made out of King s novels and short stories Even THE SHINING while technically excellent and quite scary enough was however coldly impersonal and distant just the opposite of King s novel which got you right inside the haunted Overlook and the mind of its demented caretaker But although horror may be neither Rob Reiner nor William Goldman s forte spinning ripping good yarns most certainly is The team who just three years ago brought us the lightweight but entertaining PRINCESS BRIDE have collaborated once again and produced the equally lightweight at least from a horror standpoint but equally entertaining MISERY And when it comes down to it after you strip away the blood and gore the evil clowns and giant spiders the rabid dogs and 1950 s space aliens a Stephen King novel sets out from the very first page to entertain us And although it becomes apparent after only a half hour that Rob Reiner doesn t really want to scare us very much it s clear from the very first frame that he wants to spin us a yarn he wants to keep us entertained In that MISERY is a resounding success As a horror film and as an adaptation of one of King s best novels it s somewhat of a mixed bag The novel MISERY was entertaining of course and in many ways it was a comfortable and familiar King novel just like the dozens that had preceded it and presumably like the hundreds that would follow But it was also a bit of a departure for King for this novel had no band of outcast kids no ghosts or aliens or evil forces no apocalyptic battle between the forces of good and evil no cast of thousands Instead MISERY had just two main characters locked for almost the entire novel in a battle of wits a battle which only one could survive MISERY is King s most claustrophobic novel and one of the most difficult horror novels to read The sense of impending violence doom and insanity is almost unbearable and King puts us right in the room with his alter ego the horror novelist Paul Sheldon Sheldon you see makes the mistake of getting into a near fatal car accident and then getting rescued by his number one fan Annie Wilkes a woman who isn t quite sane and who doesn t always make a lot of sense In other words a woman who would find herself quite at home in a Hollywood production meeting Annie is also a great phan of Misery Chastain the heroine of Sheldon s trashy romance novel series Although she sets out at first to help Paul recuperate from his accident though all the while preventing him from leaving or getting in touch with anyone in the outside world she soon finishes reading his latest and last entry in the Misery series And she discovers that Paul in order to free himself from the creation that had threatened to prevent him from writing serious literature forever had killed Misery off at the end of the novel thus hoping to put the series to rest once and for all Unfortunately the only thing Sheldon put to rest was any hope he might have had of leaving Annie s secluded house before the spring thaw Upon finding that Paul killed her heroine her perfect perfect heroine Annie flies into a rage and nearly kills Paul before deciding that instead of killing him he should redeem himself by writing a new Misery novel and returning his most perfect of heroines to its adoring public The rest of the novel is a tense claustrophobic battle between Paul and Annie with enough violence sprinkled throughout to keep even the most bloodthirsty of King s phans satisfied But the emphasis of the novel for all its descriptions of mangled legs and kitchen knives is on Paul and his desperate attempt to escape from Annie In the process King gets us inside the minds of both characters and as we begin to empathize with Paul we begin to feel more and more like we too are trapped in the bedroom helplessly awaiting Annie s next violent outburst That s one of the things that makes MISERY so difficult to read and one of the things that makes it a little different from King s other novels Instead of shifting the action and point of view between a dozen or so major characters King keeps the action points of view and story focused in that one bedroom and forces us to go through everything with Paul whether we want to or not And that s really the problem with MISERY the film Although it is quite faithful to the novel and although Kathy Bates seems as born to the role of Annie Wilkes as Anthony Perkins is to the role of Norman Bates Reiner never gets us to feel that same degree of terror and claustrophobia in fact we don t even see things from Paul s point of view with any degree of consistency Reiner opened MISERY up a little but as a result it seems that we spend nearly as much time with the sheriff and his wife as we do with Paul and Annie It s almost as if every time Reiner felt that the audience might be squirming a little too much in their seats he deliberately pulled back and eased up on the tension In both the novel and the film Annie is portrayed as being quite insane but Reiner makes her nearly as funny as she is scary on more than a few occasions we get to laugh at her expense But it s laughter without a payoff since we re laughing to escape from whatever tension might have been building King never let us escape that way but except for two or three specific scenes Reiner does Another problem with MISERY is James Caan s performance It might be a limitation of Goldman s script it might be Reiner s direction or it might be Caan s inability to make us feel what his character is feeling but we as the audience never really begin to empathize with Paul Oh sure we all cringe when Annie threatens to hurt Paul but that s more a visceral reaction than true empathy What s missing from MISERY is exactly what made HENRY so good a performance like the one that Michael Rooker gave one that breaks down the barrier between character and audience In HENRY we felt for a brief while what being a sociopathic killer was like but in MISERY we rarely if at all feel what it must be like to be trapped in bed and held captive by a madwoman And yet and yet Remember that the Phantom said that MISERY really felt like a King novel Well it does although sadly that novel is not MISERY But for all its problems MISERY is like a good King novel completely captivating from beginning to end It forgoes any chance of being a full tilt horror film but if it s seen neither as a strict adaptation of King s novel nor a serious horror film MISERY works just fine It works for the same reason that many of King s novels work because it is out and out entertaining regardless of whatever problems an audience might have with it Of course MISERY isn t necessarily family entertainment even though the Phantom doesn t believe that it has its heart set on horror There are enough violent scenes to keep all but the most hard core horror phan or phan of the novel satisfied And when Reiner decides to let Ms Bates loose it is simply impossible to take your eyes off the screen or your nails out of your mouth We re even willing to forgive the old Oh no The car s almost in the driveway routines and a pretty fair SLC quotient Reiner can be forgiven for this since as the Phantom has said he s new to the horror game and it s really not his type of film On the other hand his direction is always crisp and the editing is first rate It s a tribute to Reiner s skill that he can throw in tilted camera shots shots of a full moon thunder and lightning just before something bad happens and a dozen other tried and true horror film cliches and make them all work or at least keep us from realizing that they re cliches until after the credits roll And there are moments when it s obvious that he s gotten right into the spirit of things at least a half dozen times throughout the film it s as if Reiner has forgotten that he just set out to spin an entertaining yarn rather than direct a full tilt horror film On those occasions he gets the camera right up into Paul and Annie s especially Annie s faces and he really lets Kathy Bates go to town And for just a while we are treated to some truly scary scenes But inevitably the scenes end all too quickly and usually without much of a payoff and we re back to MISERY THE CAMPFIRE STORY rather than MISERY THE HORROR FILM So phans when it comes down to the final analysis MISERY is quite good and it stands as one of the better adaptations of one of King s novels which isn t of course saying much though it s really not too much of a horror film itself But if you don t go into it expecting the atmosphere that King labored so hard to create or the tension and claustrophobia that pervaded his novel the Phantom thinks you ll find it well worth seeing In fact it s worth seeing if for no reason other than to see Kathy Bates truly lunatic performance Lunatic performances are all too rare these days and the Phantom thinks that Bates Annie Wilkes makes Chucky look like Charlie McCarthy in comparison And that should be reason enough for a horror phan to check out MISERY before it leaves the theaters and heads for a very un rightful resting place between copies of LIFEFORCE and MY BLOODY VALENTINE on the horror shelves of Blockbusters nationwide It may not be a great horror film but it deserves much better company than that
0863,3 Men and a Little Lady,1990,This is the sequel to THREE MEN AND A BABY which was based on the French film THREE MEN AND A CRADLE TRES HOMMES ET LA COUCHIN Like the previous American film this was one stars Tom Selleck Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson And like the previous American film both are Touchstone films Touchstone being Disney s adult division it is an amiable innocuous charmer a fantasy in which everyone has all the money he or she needs but no one has to work very hard Unlike the French original neither American film has any of the underlayment of grit human weakness questions of responsibility or of the role of men in the upraising of our children In other words the American film went for the poop and left out the shit Fortunately in the current vehicle the baby is ready for school and long past the occasions for the unending and unendurable sight gags based on infantile incontinence Indeed the given of the film is that three men cannot continue to be a corporate daddy to one child the time has come for conventionalizing the child s family and home situation The big question here is who is going to marry the mommy thus completing the total sell out of the original film TRES HOMMES Given the fact that this sequel is as mindless and backboneless as any major American comedy of the current crop it is attractive pleasant and easy to take Tom Selleck shines forth with all his star power Danson does some amusing turns in various costumes and Guttenberg smiles winningly in the background but has virtually nothing to do One really nice element is the little lady of the title She s pretty nice believable neither health threateningly saccharine or preternaturally bratty she s smart but not alarmingly so I can recommend THREE MEN AND A LITTLE LADY to anyone needing a little R R while Christmas shopping
0864,Misery,1990,Stephen King showed up as advertised at a World Fantasy Convention I attended in Ottawa I have a review copy of CARRIE I found cheap in a used bookstore and I thought this would be a good opportunity to get it autographed I had no idea the investment of time it would require The limit was three books per person and even with that limit King could have easily spent twelve hours straight just autographing books for his fans But the number was not so amazing as the fervor of some of his fans Some fans scouted at the front of the line to find people who were holding fewer than three books and who could be coerced into getting someone else s book autographed Now recognize King is only a reasonably competent writer But he is a celebrity and every celebrity seems to have a cult of admirers in which a fair percentage carry their adulation to the point of being nuisances Martin Scorsese s KING OF COMEDY shows not too unrealistically the fervor of some fans including King s That King knows the extremities of what fans will do and uses it as the basis of a book is hardly surprising What is a little more surprising is that King would knowingly or not combine the idea with a plot that had previously been done on NIGHT GALLERY In the Marmalade Wine episode a man played by Robert Morse takes refuge from a storm in the secluded house of a lonely surgeon played by Rudy Vallee The surgeon seems only too pleased to have a guest he can care for The visitor finds himself drugged and wakes to the surgeon cheerfully informing him I ve taken the liberty of amputating your feet Have some oatmeal There are further plot parallels but revealing them would be a MISERY spoiler Well there you have the basic plot of Rob Reiner s adaptation of the Stephen King novel MISERY James Caan plays Paul Sheldon author of eight melodramatic books about a heroine named Misery He mangles himself in a car accident in a Colorado snowstorm and awakes to find himself in the overly loving care of his self professed Number One Fan Annie Wilks Kathy Bates plays Nurse Wilks who refuses to share her patient with any hospital and instead cares for him attentively in her own home Wilks takes the occasion to read the eighth book about Misery When the Number One Fan finds out Sheldon has killed off Misery the number two really hits the fan Sheldon will be held a prisoner until he writes a novel resurrecting Misery Wilks flashes from adulation to rage to depression Bates s combination of winning child like innocence and monstrous menace perhaps not so far apart is really what makes the film tick Caan s flat performance goes almost unnoticed next to Bates Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen as a husband and wife sheriff and deputy have some chemistry but not enough screen time really to show it It seems as if every popular lead actor in Hollywood will eventually be cast as the good cop in an action film and every director in Hollywood will eventually direct a Stephen King horror film Maybe it only seems that way But MISERY is certainly Rob Reiner s least remarkable film to date It is hard to imagine that MISERY is from the same director who made has a very distinguished set of films including THE SURE THING and THE PRINCESS BRIDE Reiner seems to have been gambling very heavily on Kathy Bates s performance to set this film apart and make it a Reiner film Bates was good but not that good In the end MISERY is a very minor horror film not too different from DEAD OF WINTER or several others My rating would be a high 0 on the 4 to 4 scale

0869,Edward Scissorhands,1990,I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS last night at the Ziegfield theatre is NYC A great movie theatre in terms of picture and sound quality Here are some quick impressions if you are deciding whether or not to see it ES is directed by Tim Burton whose credits include BATMAN BEETLEJUICE and PEE WEE HERMAN S BIG ADVENTURE The film is great visually and Danny Elfman has contributed a good not just Batman reedited score The plot is quite weak Winona Ryder looks about as bad as she possibly can which isn t very in a blonde wig The bad news is that the story is kind of limp But the film looks great This is more than the costumes and sets it is also how the scenes are put together how the characters behave and where the camera is and how it moves A truly fine movie needs several strong elements the script direction and acting must all be good and the producers need to have sufficient resources in money and technical types to create the sort of film they want to make It doesn t have to be a lot of money depending on what they want to do and how clever their people are EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is not a truly fine movie The only thing that works really well here is the visuals The acting is professional but nothing more the story fails to convince even in its own fantasy genre and there is very little originality in what the plot contains or how it unfolds If you only see one film this year don t pick this one But a film does not have to be truly fine in order to be worth seeing If you enjoyed THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN you will almost certainly like this movie Warning for parents though it contains somewhat more violence than MUNCHAUSEN It is easy to compare Tim Burton to Terry Gilliam JABBERWOCKY TIME BANDITS BRAZIL MUNCHAUSEN Their films have similar strengths Burton is somewhat more childlike and carefree in his imagination and Gilliam is significantly better at moving the plot along Maybe he just has a better editor Among Burton s other films I would say that EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is better than BATMAN if you take away Nicholson s performance and not as good as BEETLEJUICE
0870,Edward Scissorhands,1990,Tim Burton has been emblematic of what has been going wrong with popular films since STAR WARS Burton has a very strong visual sense but a weak story telling ability His BATMAN had a beautiful vision of a dark and mordant Gotham City but the story itself was weak and even then there were gaps in the telling His earlier BEETLEJUICE had a less developed visual sense but even worse story telling One moment characters would find themselves floating around the room or compelled to sing calypso and a moment later they would be apparently overlooking the incident like they would a burp In both films as well as PEE WEE S BIG ADVENTURE there are nice scenes but they are just not well sewn together My guess is that something very interesting happened with Burton s EDWARD SCISSORHANDS Burton told his rather Oz ian idea about a boy with scissors for hands to one Caroline Thompson As she says The minute he said to me It was so resonant and so powerful and such a clear expression of feelings that it just set the whole thing off The story is about not being able to touch anything about feeling that everything you touch turns to tatters It s about being awkward Remarkably that was the story she was able to write and the chemistry between her story telling ability and Burton s visual sense make a film orders of magnitude better than anything Burton has done without her Aside from some creative play in the very first frames of the film the first remarkable thing about the story is the setting You have a John Waters suburbia jammed together with a Jean Cocteau fairy tale castle On the hill everything is magic and unworldly while the valley wallows in 20th century pop culture and bad taste One day the Avon Lady played by Diane Wiest crosses the boundary and drives up the hill in the quest for new customers There she finds the sad and lonely Edward Scissorhands a dough cutting machine incompletely transformed into a real boy by a kindly old scientist wizard The wizard is a sort of likable Rotwang played by Burton s childhood idol Vincent Price Our Avon Lady brings this enchanted creature to the less than enchanting suburbia where Edward played incidentally by rock singer Johnny Depp attempts to adapt and apply his talents to modern life Edward faces a public who has a thin veneer of xenophilia over a deeper core of xenophobia Further complicating matters he must face his own sexual repression and stigma when attracted to Kim played by Winona Ryder the pretty daughter of the Avon Lady EDWARD SCISSORHANDS misses being a great fantasy and I think it does miss it only marginally by spending too much time in the John Waters world and complicating the plot with Edward having an unexplained power to unlock doors and hence being used in an illegal plot by Kim s boyfriend Jim Jim is played by Anthony Michael Hall and the years have not been kind to poor Anthony I m afraid They have robbed him of his teenage ungainliness and left him a rather ordinary looking adult with little screen chemistry EDWARD SCISSORHANDS still needs a little of the fine tuning that could have made it a classic film of a tragic hero of the order of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA But it works for many of the same reasons PHANTOM does with its own tragic hero suffering stigma and sexual repression I am told that Burton likes to work over and over with the same actors one reason why Michael Keaton was Batman and I hope he feels the same about screenwriters I want to see more of what Burton and Thompson can do together I really doubted that I would ever give any Burton film a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale But Burton has finally found the magic
0871,Edward Scissorhands,1990,Tim Burton is the director who brought us BEETLEJUICE BATMAN and now EDWARD SCISSORHANDS EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is briefly speaking a kind of fairy tale version of FRANKENSTEIN but unfortunately the fairy tale element is not made clear early on and the enormous holes in the story are pretty darn distracting until you accept the conventions of fairy tales and throw logic and verisimilitude onto the trash heap if you do There are indeed yawning chasms in the story s logic which are only bridged by the sense of wonder and delight which Johnny Depp elicits in your humble poster OK I m going to be perfectly frank with you and say I have not a clue as to who Johnny Depp is what he does or even what he looks if he doesn t look like Edward Scissorhands I have it in my mind that he might be a musician But actor or musician pre Edward he ought to be recognized from now own as a brilliant comedic actor highly reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton I have to say that his performance is nothing less than inspired it absolutely saves the movie from its own inconsistencies and illogic On the other hand or scissors Winona Ryder is completely lost inside her blonde wig in this movie to say nothing of wasted Burton seems to have directed her to shed all hints of personality Quite honestly any presentable young woman off the street could have delivered the same performance Fortunately for me she is shines with intense brilliance in another Christmas movie this season MERMAIDS otherwise I might write her off as completely forgetable Diane Wiess plays Winona s mother an Avon lady who discovers Edward in his castle on the edge of the most outrageously bland subdivision ever put on film Burton out Waters John Waters in his vision of a pastel hell Wiess is her usual reliable wonderful self mothering protecting always slightly out of synch with the world she lives in When she enters the castle which was decorated by a spacey descendant of the person who did up Dracula s and she says It s your Avon lady it s completely right Burton the director shines in the look and feel of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS but his story sense is as out of control as ever And will he realize that Danny Elfman s music is as irritating and distracting as it is ugly and pretentious and stop using him Another surprising deficiency were the models and mattes used to establish the castle and the suburb Completely unconvincing embarrassingly obvious For a movie that puts such an emphasis on its look has spent lots of time and money on special effects make up and cutlery this seems especially odd But to end this on a positive note let me mention the small role of the Scientist as played by Vincent Price who is looking rather old and frail these days but is still an icon to be reckoned with It was the Scientist who created Edward and died before he could give him hands In a flashback we visit his laboratory cum factory He is not so much a Mad Scientist as he is a Whimsical Scientist his machines are humorously anthropomorphic and I for one will forever envy him his cookie cutters I recommend EDWARD SCISSORHANDS if you can leave your logic in the lobby only then will you enjoy it as it should be enjoyed
0872,Mermaids,1990,MERMAIDS is Cher s first movie in two years the last being the wonderful MOONSTRUCK MERMAIDS is directed by Richard Benjamin and co stars Winona Ryder and Bob Hoskins First off let me just say that I love Cher and have since the early Sixties she is outre and outrageous and sane and I admire her intelligence and acumen her strength and courage all of which I think are visible in her life and her acting Next let me say that Cher is not a great actress her range and her gifts are narrow but within her limitations she can be amazing Cher was amazing in MOONSTRUCK In MERMAIDS she s wonderful but not quite amazing One of the reasons is that this movie is not quite the movie the older one was it lacks that romantic moment of magic the transformations of love This is not to say that MERMAIDS doesn t try to achieve a moment like the one in MOONSTRUCK when all the principals are looking at the full huge moon from their several windows The comparable moment in MERMAIDS which involves a room painted and lighted to look like a fantasy of the bottom of the sea fails the audience does not enter into the vision it merely sees Cher momentarily entranced by it This is not Cher s fault but the result of some faulty direction on the part of Richard Benjamin who was once a comic actor himself and had a charming failure of a TV series called HE AND SHE co starring his wife Paula Prentiss Another reason is that Cher seems to be stepping back to allow Winona Ryder plenty of elbow room This is really Ryder s film She is the voice over narrator and provides the audience s point of view The film is about her coming of age much more than it is about Cher s character Rachel doing some growing up of her own The film is also about the relationship between the mother and the daughter and most of the best scenes and best lines concentrate of this In fact Winona Ryder gives the amazing performance in this film Her range and her gifts seems unlimited and promise even greater things as she matures She is the glue that holds this movie together The movie is mostly comedy with one melodramatic episode and it s the kind of movie with wonderful one liners that people are going to be pleased to quote to each other Death is dwelling on the past and staying in one place too long All of Charlotte s ages are difficult The script is by June Roberts who wrote Experience Preferred But not Essential and is based on a novel by Patty Danns In addition to Cher and Ryder the other principals include Hoskins who although he has been adorable has never been cuter than in his role of the shoe store owner and boyfriend In fact his mugging and eye brow waggling are on the verge of being totally out of control by the last scene And then there is the role of the younger daughter played by Christina Ricci who impressed me tremendously A natural eccentric child who seemed oblivious to the camera Finally I need to say something about Benjamin s direction and Roberts script The finest most singular scene in MERMAIDS concerns the morning John Kennedy was assassinated I was in tears during the entire scene it so perfectly brought back exactly what that experience was like for all of us who were alive then and old enough to understand it Men standing in the street with tears streaming down their faces Clots of people watching TV together in doorways An entire nation come to a standstill The evocation of 63 64 is almost flawless I saw a couple of impossible details in set decors but that s pretty good certainly the spirit of the times beautifully invoked The soundtrack will undoubtedly find a good sales being choked full of all sorts of classics of the period These are praiseworthy qualities the director and writer have brought to the movie On the other hand I was upset by some of the directional decisions Benjamin made some awkwards cuts for one thing especially one where Cher slaps Ryder in the kitchen and suddenly we cut to the living room it was absolutely disorienting completely without continuity Inexcusably awkward Overall I can recommend MERMAIDS It s funny and entertaining and it leaves you feeling good at the end I note that the audience that I was part of was overwhelming composed of women From this I take it that MERMAIDS is women s film I think that lots of people will go to MERMAIDS and they will go back a second and third time
0873,Cyrano de Bergerac,1990,I saw CYRANO DE BERGERAC yesterday It is by Jean Paul Rappeneau and stars Gerard Depardieu in the title role It is of course based on the play by Edmund Rostand I am a long time Cyrano fan I have seen the Jose Ferrer version several times and seen it performed as a play twice I have also read two translations And I m not even counting Steve Martin s ROXANNE I went to this film expecting it to be great and I have to admit I was disappointed I think this was partially my own nearly jaded familiarity with the story and partially a result of the film In particular the sub titles are the bane of this movie The film tries much harder than the Ferrer version to avoid seeming like a play The locations are detailed and look authentic In many ways the translation reminds me of Zefferelli s ROMEO AND JULIET It is beautifully shot and the camera work is top notch Depardieu gives another wonderful performance and the rest of the cast is up to his level Despite being filmed as a movie no liberties were taken with the dialogue from the play as far as I could tell although at least a few scenes were trimmed The film is in French and frankly I think that this is why the film kind of fell flat for me The subtitles were excellent written by Anthony Burgess but they were very distruptive particularly when they became idiomatic Burgess went to great trouble I think to construct rhyming subtitles when appropriate but at times this causes a gap between the sub titles and the actual dialogue There is also a lot of dialogue spoken very rapidly and I found myself often straining to keep up with the lines and still look at the film itself Subtitles are a blunt instrument designed to allow a foreigner to enjoy a film and follow the plot This film foils them I am not suggesting that the film such have been dubbed That would have been far worse But this film depends heavily on language and subtitling is just not adequate There were several French speakers in the audience and they were rapt During the final scene many all men were crying This is how I recall reacting when I saw the play and read the book This time though I felt more emotion seeing the reactions of those around me than in seeing the film To sum up this film is breath taking and wonderful if you speak French If not you might actually prefer the English Ferrer version even though it is really a far inferior film Better yet see it as a play
0874,Vie et rien dautre La,1989,Director Bertrand Tavernier Cast Philippe Noiret Sabine Azema Pascal Vignal Screenplay Jean Cosmos and Bertrand Tavernier Major Dellaplane Philippe Noiret is the director of the War Casualties Information Bureau One of his official responsibilities is to match corpses amnesiacs and worldly effects with the 350 000 reports of soldiers missing in action MIA The other official but secret responsibility is to find a very dead very unrecognizable but very French unknown soldier to go under the Arc de Triumphe in Paris You might say he doesn t see his job in the same light as his superiors Methodically Dellaplane leads the effort of counting corpses photographing faces interviewing family members and collecting identifying information about each missing soldier He ignores the request for an unknown soldier for as long as possible The idea of giving up on identifying any corpse is morally repugnant to Dellaplane He does what any unwilling bureaucrat would he stalls for time and impedes progress Impatiently his superior tells him to find a body already and stop sending the horrid body count statistics His superior wants unidentified corpses exhumed in hopes of finding a suitable candidate Dellaplane provides Oriental gravediggers who will not touch the dead for religious reasons Most of France it seems is impatient to bury the 1 500 000 dead along with all the remnants of war Except of course for the families of the 350 000 missing and for the new profiteers of war the war memorial sculptors artisans the lumber suppliers the cooks who feed the remaining army and the private investigators who for a fee locate and bundle up the dead If this were an American movie we d see grim people in a grim landscape The camera would show us for example a close up of a face edged in tragedy then would shift focus and show us an artistically arranged stack of decomposing bodies But this isn t an American movie We see no corpses Instead of iconic characters whose names might as well be Heartbroken or Disillusioned we meet villagers and soldiers who simply and anonymously do their jobs of clearing debris and rebuilding the village They are pragmatic and unsentimental We meet two women Irene Sabine Azema the Parisienne daughter in law of a senator and Alice Pascal Vignal a local schoolteacher Irene is looking for her MIA husband and Alice is looking for her MIA fiancee Irene seems to be the imperious upperclass type when we first meet her while Alice seems the impressionable tenderhearted young thing Irene attempts to use her father in law s clout and her pointedly superior social position to increase the amount of effort expended in finding her husband Major Dellaplane is not impressed He tells Irene that her husband will receive precisely 1 350 000th of his attention Also she should harbor no romantic notions that her husband will reappear and be all right Dellaplane tells her curtly Even if he is alive the very fact that he hasn t returned makes it a good thing that he hasn t he is either dead or might as well be dead Alice gets a similar lecture from the Major Neither lecture has the desired effect though both women are determined to find what they re looking for We begin to see that Irene and Alice share more than a common goal They share qualities called fortitude and loyalty and perseverance Much like Dellaplane himself We learn about Dellaplane gradually the way we would in person He is an intriguing complex man An example to the men underneath him he is courageous in the face of danger unquestionably willing to work ceaselessly through a crisis and completely committed to his cause He is a gentleman He is also temperamental abrupt and boorish He has researched Irene s husband but he doesn t share this information with her until he can produce a definitive answer During the rest of the film we watch their relationship change from mutual hostility to mutual respect Dellaplane resists the effort to symbolize or glorify the colossal loss of life To him such symbolism hides the loss More important to Dellaplane is to chronicle the deaths as completely as possible so that the business of life can ensue Every day civilians gather outside a mined tunnel hoping to find clues that reveal whether their sons died in there They cannot go home without knowing Neither can France heal without this issue put to rest Yet the officials over Dellaplane glorify the dead instead of laying them to rest Villagers attempt to redraw their village boundaries so they can show they had losses The sculptors delight in the 35 000 villages that each want a monument honoring their dead Soldiers stand to sing a patriotic song in a surge of national fervor The director offers a counterpoint We see an aunt and uncle enter the mined tunnel in order to identify and claim their nephew A young soldier accompanies them When the makeshift casket is opened the aunt looks in and tilts her head He is so thin she says The soldier faints the uncle carries him out Perhaps nowhere else in the film is the personal reality of war so sharply drawn This is an understated piece done by the same director as A SUNDAY IN THE COUNTRY Tavernier shows us both the consequences of chauvinism and the resilience that allowed France to emerge with such dignity The warning and the hope one could say
0875,Rookie The,1990,This film contains the obvious Clint Eastwood as the veteran police officer that never does anything by the rule book and Martin Sheen as the clean cut rookie that has an excellent record and has just been transferred to the grand theft auto division of the police department despite his father s wish for him to be a businessman Sheen has college degrees Eastwood s partner has just been killed where have we seen this before and Sheen is the new one A famous car smuggler just happened to fall into Eastwood s lap and he is going to crack the case no matter what even though his boss has told him not to interfere with the case anymore The dynamic duo go through incredible measures to catch the criminal on unbelievable terms Nothing seems a shock in this movie the plot is not a good one anyone could tell you what was to happen next The special effects are mediocre the best bit is the two superheroes escape from the second story of a building that has been rigged and is about to explode Yet when the smuggler and his girl are caught and are both shot in the forehead no blood appears How unreal Action scenes are filmed with a new technique the subjects can barely be seen because of the blur of the constant moving of the camera The cheesey ending told me that I should not have relied on the good names of the stars Eastwood and Sheen are great actors they were dealt horrible roles No actor ress could have pulled off this movie with success cjw rating system Great movie I would pay 6 00 to see it again It was O K I would only pay the 2 50 to rent the video to see it again It was not too good but would watch it again if someone else paid It sucked and do not want to see it again under any conditions
0876,Havana,1990,It s December 1958 and a gambler Robert Redford is on his way to Havana to earn some money playing high stakes poker as he regularly does On the boat he does a favor for a beautiful woman Lena Olin THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING ENEMIES A LOVE STORY Their paths cross again in Havana and Redford spends the rest of the film pursuing both Olin and the big score But the Batista government is on its last legs the rebels are about to win and the revolution ultimately upsets Redford s plans for both Olin and the score HAVANA starts off encouragingly with a beautifully edited montage of scenes designed to make Havana seem sensual exciting and dangerous This atmosphere is sustained for about an hour into the film and then the love story takes over and things fall flat Apart Redford and Olin are fine Redford looking much older than I ve ever seen him is a convincing man of the world and Olin s performance has considerable depth giving the feeling that her character s political convictions are genuine But when they get together the chemistry isn t there This is unfortunate because it becomes obvious fairly early on that HAVANA is a remake of CASABLANCA with Redford and Olin in the Bogart and Bergman roles In the scenes without Olin Redford pulls this off fairly well but when he has to be tender with Olin it just seems lame and out of character It s no spoiler to say that the film develops in much the same way CASABLANCA does although the price that Redford is forced to pay at the end is much less than Bogart ultimately had to pay which I felt trivialized the ending The conclusion contains some rather incoherent events relating to the CIA s involvement in Batista s government which I felt blunted the impact of the film the incoherence that is not the presence of the CIA itself HAVANA does a very good job of presenting what the atmosphere and feel of the city must have been like at that time at least to a visiting American There s not much discussion of how the city must have seemed to poor Cubans and rebels although that wasn t the point of the film and could be excused The film does a good job of contrasting the decadence of the city with the war in the countryside and the brutality of the secret police that underlies everyday life The film was shot in Santo Domingo and the filmmakers were impressively successful in reproducing the feeling of familiarity and strangeness that Havana must have presented to Americans of the late 1950s Americans don t think much about Havana anymore we re reminded here that the city was a long ferry ride away and that Americans once considered the place not entirely foreign soil The supporting cast is good Alan Arkin does an excellent job as Redford s friend a casino manager with no illusions about what s coming This is the Claude Rains part The husband of the Olin character played by Raul Julia in an uncredited role due to a dispute over the billing to which Julia was entitled is good in the Paul Henried part and the actor who plays the chief of police whose name I didn t catch is also good In short the film is not bad but it s no CASABLANCA although there s no shame in that It needed a more convincing love story and the ending should have both hurt more and been more exhilarating in the manner of CASABLANCA
0877,Havana,1990,Gambler Jack Weil played by Robert Redford has a piece of advice for revolutionary Bobby Duran played by Lena Olin about how to play roulette You should not put all your money on one number You go for a more modest bet like betting on black You still lose you money but you lose it more slowly Or another example Hollywood should bet on a bankable combination like Sidney Pollack directing Robert Redford in films like THE WAY WE WERE THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR ELECTRIC HORSEMAN and OUT OF AFRICA Eventually you will come up double zero on a 45 million spectacle but it will take longer Double zero is essentially what Universal has with HAVANA One of the zeroes is a political thriller that pits the pre revolutionary scummy government of Batista against the idealistic supporters of Fidel Castro most of whom we know are destined to have a rude awakening in the years to come The other zero is a love story in which the lovers have all the chemistry of champagne and Miracle Whip Redford plays Jack Weil a wise cracking gambler who sticks to business but might have more going on below the surface much like Rick Blaine in CASABLANCA He becomes the third side of a triangle in which the other two sides are a married couple of revolutionaries Lena Olin and Raul Julia living a dangerous life much like Ilsa Lund and Victor Laszlo in CASABLANCA Weil must decide if he will do nothing and let events take their course try to steal the woman or become committed to the cause much as Rick does in CASABLANCA Now it seems to me that some film other than HAVANA has used this plot before It s on the tip of my mind but oh well Seriously one reason that this film does not engage the audience like CASABLANCA did is that Bogart was an actor who could show pain Redford can wince a little Of the love story the political thriller and the setting the setting wins by default Much of that humungous budget went into creating the look and feel of Havana of 1958 Others have vouched for its accuracy I can vouch only for its believability Not that pre revolutionary Havana was that interesting a city but filming in the Dominican Republic Pollack has captured at least a believable look And at nearly two and a half hours in length the film lets you get a long look And you might as well look at the background you are not missing much in the foreground I give this film a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0878,Mr. & Mrs. Bridge,1990,MR MRS BRIDGE is adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala from two novels by Evan S Connell MRS BRIDGE 1959 and MR BRIDGE 1969 the film is produced and directed by the team of Merchant Ivory that earlier brought us ROOM WITH A VIEW MAURICE and others The artistic goal and challenge is to find what is interesting dramatic and human in the smug comfortable country club lives in this case Kansas City Mission Hills 1930 s and early 1940 s The movie consists of a series episodes almost vignettes not quite but nearly free standing We move from the rigid glacial walls the characters present us to see them as real people with their own pains and tragedies There is much comedy here and some sadness If we watch them and only say what s the problem they have everything they need we are being very much like some of the characters themselves Part of their tragedy is often an inability to sympathize to see beyond their own narrow lives In slowly opening up the characters to us the movie is entirely successful Much of the success is probably Ruth Prawer Jhabvala s script which moves by easy degrees like a new friendship The opening introductions the growing knowledge of the other person s personality and quirks and faults the acceptance the caring the concern and involvement Much of the success has to go to Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward who have been making movies together off and on for 35 years more or less Honestly I have never seen them act better It will be the subject of some discussion over who does the better job Woodward s performance is a little easier to appreciate her character is more lovable and emotional she does wonderful things communicating strength and fragility confusion and wisdom Newman s character is inarticulate superficially unloving under control unemotional and underneath as seething and emotional as any of us making that characterization live is a major achievement for an actor and Newman delivers Of course the title characters are not the only ones The supporting performances were uniformly excellent I especially liked the juicy job of the very advanced psychiatrist who lives in a moderniste house with African sculpture wears loud waistcoats and a beard and seems always to be enjoying enormously a cigar and a private joke He is played by the same actor who played the country vicar in ROOM WITH A VIEW and who romped so enthusiastically in the nude bathing scene Simon Callow I can also mention with pleasure the performance of Blythe Danner Mrs Bridge s best and unhappy friend Like all of Merchant Ivory s period pieces the look of this movie is wonderful rich convincing and detailed I wholeheartedly recommend MR MRS BRIDGE to all adults
0879,Godfather: Part III The,1990,It s Christmas night and I m eating frozen lasagna for dinner That probably expresses my emotions about THE GODFATHER III more than any formal review I could write But that s a cheat Maybe some people out there prefer frozen lasagna the real thing and may think I m praising the movie so I d better be explicit I m a real fan of both THE GODFATHER I II and looked forward to GIII for a long time While Coppola s had a long run of bad luck APOCALYPSE NOW the Godfather movies and PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED are some of my favorite movies I thought he could pull a third Godfather movie off The third Godfather movie is a triumph of style over substance The set decorations are wonderful But the direction acting and scripting of this movie are pitiful The direction is particularly poor Combine this with the ragged editing and you have a real mess People who didn t see the first movie might be lost On the other hand it might help to not be familiar with those earlier fine films The basic problem with this movie is that it is stupidly written The plot is pretty unbelievable to begin with and it includes elements that are ludicrous One of the strengths of the first two movies was that it was believable GIII is as close to reality as PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED was My complaints with this movie are many and varied but they center around the scripting for and acting of the character of Michael Corleone In the first two movies Puzo Coppola and Pacino created a tragic figure In the third movie he s just an old man in decline In the first two movies you could both sympathize with and be afraid of Michael In the third it s hard to do either Pacino has the same dour frozen expression for about two thirds of this movie When he finally smiles you expect his face to break I d hoped initial rumors about the acting ability of Sofia Coppola might have been off base They weren t In the words of another reviewer about another actress She runs the gamut of emotion from A to B I like that she didn t look like an actress but other than that an exhausted Winona Ryder still would have acted circles around this young woman Maybe Coppola will grow into being a fine actress women like Sally Field Jessica Lange and Farrah Fawcett didn t act in their first few movies either and they ve improved dramatically Other than the sets what can I praise about this movie Not much Andy Garcia and Talia Shire turn in the best performances of the movie Diane Keaton was better than she was in GII GI moved from being about Don Vito to being about Michael It was subtle at times about the way power corrupts people and sometimes it hit you over the head with it Part of the power in GI and GII was watching the payoff at the end of each movie In GI Michael becomes the Godfather literary and figuratively In GII Michael has become hollow and corrupt In GIII Michael strives for redemption and it s clear he doesn t get it even though he long outlives his enemies The opera scene and the shoot out on the steps afterwards were both way too long It would have been a stronger movie to find out what happened to Vinnie after the shoot out During the last third of the film it s hinted that Vinnie is double crossing Michael We don t know if this is the case or not This was too important a point to drop I d guess about a third of the audience and the theater was pretty full was moved by the ending but most of us got out of our seats and left in a hurry No one applauded Arrgghhh I haven t been this disappointed by a movie in a very long time Coppola should have stopped while he was ahead yes I know he made the movie in return for a picture deal from Paramount
0880,Russia House The,1990,THE RUSSIA HOUSE I may slip and call this the Russian House somewhere in the course of this notice I once lived in a Russian language only institute call Russian House and the habit is ingrained I fear stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer with Klaus Maria Brandauer and Roy Scheider inter alia it is based on a novel by John LeCarre of the same name This is touted as LeCarre s first post Cold War suspense novel cum movie and so it may be but alas Cold War pre post or amid thriller have never been my preferred reading genre and I have not had the pleasure of any of LeCarre s efforts However I have seen movies based on his works THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD staying especially in the memory And my memory is that as stories they were pretty well muddled affairs and my impression has been that they did not translate the novels into film well I think it is possible LeCarre and his readers have been better served in THE RUSSIA HOUSE The screenplay was written by Tom Stoppard a very respectable writer in his own right Certainly I was left with none of the well somebody did something to somebody that much is clear at any rate as Alice said after hearing the Jabberwocky feeling I ve felt in the past in the face of this cloak and dagger tomfoolery Here instead I have a pretty straightforward kind of story with a beginning a middle and an end This is not to say it doesn t have its surprises twists turns and suspense It s just that here the theme is crystal clear throughout loyalty People s loyalties are tested defined and put the test The final loyalty the one the film endorses ultimately is typical of our post CW sensibility and I for one am glad to see it As to the performances Connery Pfeiffer and company do good solid yeomanlike work I don t think anybody really sails here but no one does a pratfall either In some ways Connery s performance could be the most suspect insofar as he turns one of his standard curmudgeons with a heart of gold interpretations but the man has such presence such command of the screen that it is hard not to just bathe in it gratefully even though I did not find him nearly as disreputable in the beginning as he should have been nor his transformation nearly so graduated as it could have been Pfeiffer in so ways takes more chances with her role as Katya the go between the Russian woman who loves both Brandauer the great scientist and Connery the sodden British publisher For one thing she does a pretty creditable Russian accent and speaks a little Russian here and there in a not embarrassing way as near as this former student of Russian can detect Among the supporting players Brandauer and Scheider are the most familiar to me For those of us who have seen COLONEL REDL all other Brandauer performances seem footnotes but I can t think of film that hasn t been better for his presence especially the worse ones like OUT OF AFRICA I was just wondering to myself the other day what Roy Scheider was doing these days Here he plays the CIA bigshot and does a good job of being alternately or simultaneously a jerk and a gentleman James Fox plays his British counterpart at Russia House and does a fine turn His real purpose appears to be slimy in just such a civil way as puts the upstart Yanks in their place One of the real draws of THE RUSSIA HOUSE is the wonderful location photography especially that in Moscow and Leningrad This must be the first Western thriller that was shot in the Soviet Union instead of using Helsinki as a stand in see GORKY PARK for example Fascinating revealing and gorgeous used to great effect throughout Fred Schepisi the director and the production people especially the director of photography Ian Baker ought to be in line for some appropriate recognition in this area I have no problem in recommending THE RUSSIAN HOUSE to anyone who doesn t mind quite a lot of rough language There s no nudity no open sex no graphic violence but oh the language
0881,Russia House The,1990,Capsule review Colorless spy story keeps promising to pay off with something happening but plot twists are a long time coming Photography in Russia tries to make it look exotic and interesting but the rather drab cities are not the best photographic subjects Rating 0 4 to 4 At the beginning of THE RUSSIA HOUSE three notebooks purportedly containing Soviet military secrets have been passed to a British publisher and the British want to know if the notebooks are genuine An hour and forty minutes into THE RUSSIA HOUSE we have seen a lot of Russian scenery we know some of the characters involved a little better a fourth notebook has been passed and now the Americans as well as the British want to know if the notebooks are genuine That may well be how the spy business really is but it really is not a very good piece of story telling It would be one thing if the evidence built up in an interesting way the way it did in a previous LeCarre adaptation TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY But here we are dealing with far less than compelling characters The two main characters are Sean Connery as British publisher Barley Blair and Michelle Pfeiffer as Soviet publisher Katya Katya passes the notebooks written by a former lover Klaus Maria Brandauer as the enigmatic Dante Barley and Blair seem to fall in love for reasons never very clear This has to be a what s the attraction love pairing to rival the one in HAVANA Fred Schepisi has taken a script that would move moderately well at thirty minutes and stretched it to a hundred and twenty three One way that he has stretched it is to show you the scenery of Russia mostly Moscow and Leningrad This plays off the new post glasnost interest in the Soviet Union however it seems unlikely this film will greatly contribute to Soviet tourism While many of the buildings are of majestic design the film only underscored the drabness of Russia That drabness is further emphasized by filming Russia with perpetually overcast skies The film also unsells tourism by underscoring how much the economy has degraded under glasnost As Katya complains Glasnost gives everyone the right to complain and accuse but it doesn t make shoes Curiously Katya manages to be able to get plenty of eye make up as Michelle Pfeiffer s characters always do What is curious about the uninteresting background is that the screenplay is by Tom Stoppard who made Shanghai mystical and fascinating in his screenplay for EMPIRE OF THE SUN Here however he tries to show us not a physical landscape but the figurative landscape of the world of espionage and counter espionage LeCarre can make that landscape interesting but it does not come through in Stoppard s screenplay I like Stoppard and LeCarre but I hope they realize they are no good for each other I rate their result a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0882,Mermaids,1990,Rachel Flax played by Cher has not handle responsibility well On the surface she seems a likable kook with some odd ways of getting through life with minimal commitment When life gets too hectic for her she packs up and moves on together with her two daughters What she refuses to face is that she is hurting everyone around her and making both daughters incredibly neurotic At first the viewer chuckles at the odd quirks of the family but with time the chuckling becomes more uneasy and we get a feel for the painful contortions the Flax family is being put through by their mother s willful avoidance of any commitment The movie is seen from 15 year old daughter Charlotte s point of view as she desperately tries to understand her coming of age with no guidance whatsoever from her mother Charlotte is played by the ubiquitous Winona Ryder who is currently in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and WELCOME HOME ROXY CARMICHAEL and is rumored to have had a nervous breakdown that prevented her from also being cast as Michael Corleone s daughter in THE GODFATHER III Predictably she gets everything confused One minute she wants to become a nun though she is Jewish she is fixated on Catholicism and the next she is praying to be raped by the 26 year old hunk who is the caretaker at a nearby convent Mrs Flax is having her current affair with a Lou Landsky who owns the local shoe store Foot Friendly There are a couple of problems here actually Foot Friendly at least sounds like a take off on the phrase user friendly but MERMAIDS is set in 1963 before terminology like X friendly was familiar or perhaps even invented The second is that the script apparently calls for Lou to be Jewish and from the Midwest and the role is something of a stretch for actor Bob Hoskins His character Lou realizes that behind all the weirdness there is a lot of pain in the Flax family He wants to help but must tread a narrow line of helping the children and not scaring Rachel into moving on Richard Benjamin directed though a recent PBS discussion said that Cher was able to maintain much of the artistic control The script s worst faults are its lulling the audience into believing the material would be light weight and a gratuitous piece of suspense toward the end that cheapens the effect of the film and makes it seem more manipulative where earlier it had been more sensitive Still MERMAIDS has more to it than first meets the eye I rate it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0883,Vincent & Theo,1990,With the world celebrating the 100th anniversary of Vincent Van Gogh s death the time was ripe for a biographic film about the artist Kirk Douglas had played Van Gogh in the 1956 film LUST FOR LIFE but that was a sort of polished Hollywood version This time we have an international production directed by Robert Altman It seems from Altman s film about the great artist who was so misunderstood in his own time that in fact there was good reason to misunderstand Vincent Van Gogh Tim Roth who plays Van Gogh with an English accent makes his subject not just someone you would not want to meet he makes him someone who could drive you out of a room just be entering it Vincent chooses to live in squalor not through poverty at least initially but through apathy His teeth are rotted and discolored through lack of care and his clothing is tattered His fascination with color is by no means limited to his painting He seems to have a passion for smearing himself with paint and for eating his paints we see him licking paint at several points in the film VINCENT AND THEO concentrates not surprisingly on the love hate relationship between Vincent and his brother Theo A little ungraciously the film shows Theo s wife as having little but disgust and disregard for Vincent while historically it was her perseverance that eventually brought the art of Vincent Van Gogh to the attention of critics While that is not wholly inconsistent with what we see in the film it does seem unlikely considering her constantly unfriendly attitude toward her brother in law not surprisingly toward a man who seems to like to take a big mouthful of wine and then drool it out of his mouth Kirk Douglas played Van Gogh as a man of deep passions Roth plays him as just plain weird and cold with occasional explosions of emotions It is hard to judge which is the more accurate representation though the earlier interpretation is by far the more watchable and dramatically interesting There is an odd disjointed quality to the script Syphilis victim Theo in one scene tries fails and tells his wife I can t pee any more In the next scene he is back at work as if it were just an activity of no importance that has been dropped from his schedule Though my wife did not remember it I really thought I heard one character tell another to look him up in the phone book We both heard a reference to South American velvet painting which seems a likely anachronism
0884,Godfather: Part III The,1990,In these days of making popular films into series by far the most respected series is the now three part Godfather saga Both THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II won the Best Picture Academy Award and it is very likely we will be seeing a campaign to get THE GODFATHER PART III the same award No sequel other than THE GODFATHER PART II has ever won Best Picture The series has even outlived the accuracy of the title since Michael Corleone was certainly not the Godfather in PART I and seems only rarely to use the title of Godfather In many ways this is also the most deserving of being a series since the stories really do build on each other and lose a great deal if viewed out of order There is now authenticity from the fact that when a character remembers an event from years earlier the audience also remembers it from a point in time that is genuinely years earlier for them If Michael remembers the death of his first wife many years ago I also remember it from eighteen years ago It is not that there is really such original writing In many ways we are repeatedly seeing the same story For fear of spoilers I can list only some superficial parallels here and will say more in the afterward Each film starts with a long sequence that is a celebration of an important family event a wedding a confirmation an award from the Pope Each also concludes with a family event One thinks of the films as being about the family business but in fact the subject is very rarely even mentioned There is very little about how the Corleones acquire their money Instead these films are almost exclusively about meta business issues such as the politics of dealing with the competition the issue arises in each film Perhaps the reason for the chosen concentration is that the Corleones would be much less sympathetic if the films were about their day to day business Even visual touches are repeated There is always a scene in the Corleone kitchen with a big pot on the stove As the film opens Michael Corleone do I really have to say he is played by Al Pacino is still trying to whitewash the family name and to live up to the nobility of the name Corleone Lionheart He has contributed vast sums of money to charitable works At one point we see a hospital named for Vito Corleone and probably not because Vito provided them with patients At the opening Michael is contributing 100 000 000 for poverty relief for Sicily and receiving the order of San Sebastian from the Pope Of note is that there is far less of the ethnic Italian feel to this event than there was at Connie s wedding The Corleones are apparently assimilating American styles Michael feels that he is finally achieving legitimacy and respectability But there is a problem with Vincent Mancini played by Andy Garcia who despite the surname is the son of Sonny Corleone played by James Caan in Parts I and II Vincent is the most likely heir to the family business but he is also something of a loose cannon He is as temperamental and power hungry as his father was Vincent has a feud with his current boss a hood named Joey Zasa played by Joe Mantegna Vincent is attracted to Michael s daughter Mary In fact the choice of the plain looking Sofia Coppola the director s daughter for Mary instead of the originally cast attractive Winona Ryder may actually work for the film Coppola is not a great actress but putting a less attractive woman in the role creates interesting speculation as to Vincent s motives There is no great mystery as to why Vincent would be interested in a woman as attractive as Winona Ryder But Vincent has an eye for good looking women and the power hungry nephew s interest in Mary could well be power rather than physical attraction In any case Michael is dead set against a relationship between these two grandchildren of Vito Corleone It is Vincent s feud and Michael s relation with the Vatican that are the springboard for this third story Michael s other child is Anthony who like the young Michael wants no part of the family business and wants instead to sing grand opera In fact his debut performance at La Scala in the lead no less becomes an important event in the film The choice of opera Pietro Mascagni s Cavalleria Rusticana is of course highly appropriate The title literally translates to Rustic Chivalry and refers to the code of honor of the poor Sicilians of the story The concept of this Sicilian code of honor pervades the Godfather films as well as the opera The emphasis on this favor for that favor how one treats the Don and symbolic gestures such as the Kiss of Death are equally important in the series and in this opera of the hatred of Turridu and Alfio In the time honored Sicilian custom Alfio challenges Turridu by embracing him and Turridu signifies he accepts the challenge by biting Alfio s ear Naturally the opera ends in bloodshed The sweetly melancholic Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana may already be familiar to filmgoers from its use in RAGING BULL Coppola uses it in THE GODFATHER PART III to underscore the final scenes of the film So does this new film live up to its predecessors It is flawed of course but then PART II diluted its effect by jumping around in time to pick up pieces of storyline both before and after the first film That was the flaw that television thought it could correct when it re edited the first two parts into one chronological story Comments on that effort will appear in my afterword The third film is no more flawed and probably in a league with the first two I would rate it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale In case you re curious I would rate THE GODFATHER a 3 and THE GODFATHER PART II a high 2 Spoiler follows Spoiler afterword Earlier in this review I talked about a repeating structure in the Godfather films Let me be more detailed The films always start with a major family event and they always end with a bloodbath that coincides with another major family event baptism marriage separation son s operatic debut at La Scala In each case Michael is trying to make himself or his whole family legitimate but he is stymied There is some unspeakable act committed by an apparent enemy the Tataglias the Rosatos Joey Zasa Michael decides his honor and the general safety of the family demand revenge However the perpetrator is only the apparent enemy The real enemy pulling the strings does not show his face except as an apparent peacemaker Barzini Roth Altobello In the end the ersatz peacemaker and all his co conspirators are dispatched in the bloodbath that spans only hours or minutes This strikes me as being too strong a parallel in structure to be just coincidence It in fact goes beyond formula Each film is a repetition of the same melodrama Michael is trying to be good Someone interprets this as weakness and moves against him The urge for revenge with Sicilian anger takes over Vito s mother too promised Don Cicci that she and Vito would not take action against him and asked for peace He murdered her in cold blood Vito s Sicilian revenge must wait for the proper time but honor demands it Vito s son Michael replays this melodrama in each film I did not see the television re editing in which the first two parts were edited so they told one story in chronological order I have been told it is an improvement I find it hard to believe however since each story is a re telling of an instance of Michael repeating his father s tragedy Re editing would violate the internal structure The improved version sounds too much like taking Shakespeare s HENRY IV Parts I and II and HENRY V editing them together to make one long play then showing it over five nights with commercials
0885,Godfather: Part III The,1990,It is here Yes after sixteen years Francis Ford Coppola has decided to complete the epic story of the Corleone family For those who can remember back to THE GODFATHER PART II we last left Michael Corleone sitting alone contemplating the fact that he had ordered the execution of his own brother Fredo The third installment of the Godfather trilogy takes place twenty years after THE GODFATHER PART II Aging Michael Corleone is trying to turn his dream into a reality His dream has been to make the Corleone family completely legitimate Michael has been attempting to do this ever since he took over control of the family at the end of the first film THE GODFATHER The film opens with Michael Corleone receiving a humanitarian award from the Archbishop Michael is later approached by the Archbishop who has been placed in financial charge of the Vatican In an effort to help the Vatican overcome their financial trouble Michael offers to donate 600 million dollars in exchange for the Vatican s controlling interest in a company called Imobilare It is Michael s belief that if he can gain control of the financially strong company he would finally be able to make the Corleone family legitimate Michael encounters problems when several members of The Vatican council refuse to give controlling interest of Imobilare to Michael because his family is involved in organized crime Al Pacino returns to his familiar role as Michael Corleone along with Diane Keaton who reprises her role as Michael s estranged wife Kay Also returning as Connie Corleone is Talia Shire The film also stars newcomers Andy Garcia as Sonny Corleone s illegitimate son and Sophia Coppola as Michael s daughter The fine cast is also joined by veteran actors Eli Wallach George Hamilton and Joe Mantegna There is also a small role played by Don Novello who is best remembered as Father Guido Sarducci on Saturday Night Live This film is beautifully filmed with splendid cinematography of New York and Sicily but it also contains the violence that has become a trademark of the Godfather films The performance of Pacino was adequate he portrayed an aging and sick Michael who couldn t overcome the guilt of having his brother killed but it is the performances of Andy Garcia and Talia Shire that really stand out in this movie This film is unarguably not as good as its two predecessors but I believe this film is good enough to stand on its own as a continuation of the Corleone saga See this film before someone makes you an offer you can t refuse
0886,Kindergarten Cop,1990,If you re looking for a fun movie you can t do much better than KINDERGARTEN COP No it isn t brain surgery but it s a funny well paced movie that pits Arnold Schwarzenegger against murderers and kindergarteners The movie opens in a mall in LA where John Kimball Arnie is trailing a hoodlum Said hoodlum shoots a man which Kimball misses but a friend of the man sees it The friend doesn t want to cooperate but Kimball convinces her to and he learns that the hoodlum is looking for his son who is hiding in Oregon Kimball is able to put the hoodlum in jail but the hoodlum has a mother who effectively prevents the friend from testifying against her baby boy But this is the throwaway part of the movie The movie really starts humming when Kimball and O Hara wonderfully played by Pamela Reed go up to Astoria Oregon to infiltrate the kindergarten and find out which kid has such a dangerous father and would his mysterious mother turn state s evidence against a man she s been running away from for four years Illness prevents O Hara an ex teacher herself from going to school so Kimball has to teach the kids There are lots of funny scenes here more than the trailer would show you The kids are cast very well They aren t too cute and they aren t overly destructive A few say some truly outrageous but always true things like My Dad is a gynecologist He spends all day looking up vaginas I particularly enjoyed the wonderful rapport that O Hara and Kimball had When Kimball starts falling for one of the other teachers and a prime suspect for the runaway mother O Hara magically becomes Ursula Kimball s sister from Austria Penelope Miller gives a nice performance as said teacher and the Cousins twins give a sweet performance as her overly helpful son Dominick Arnie has a knack for choosing good scripts I don t think he s been in a bad movie since the Conan flicks though his first film was one of the worst movies of all time HERCULES IN NEW YORK He s not a great actor and he can t be subtle but he s very enjoyable It s PG 13 should kids see it It depends A few of the kids use correct anatomical words and that may bother some parents There s a scene with brief male nudity no not Arnie The last fifteen minutes or so when the hoodlum father and his slimey mother arrive in Astoria may bother some sensitive children My ten year old daughter really enjoyed it Oh and all you Pamela Reed fans out there there s is a superb moment for you just before the end of the movie I won t say what happens but I know I enjoyed it I hate movies that advertive themselves as the feel good movie of the year but I think KINDERGARTEN COP was just that for me
0887,Kindergarten Cop,1990,I enjoyed this more than I was expecting to In fact one of my motivations for going at all was that I d seen almost everything else that I intend to see except for some imports in Seattle s University District which would have inconvenient to get to tonight New Year s Eve as well as foolhardy Another reason to see it for me was the fact that it had been shot in Astoria Oregon and near Cannon Beach Ecola State Park in fact These are areas where I spend a lot of my time and I wanted to see some familiar landmarks on the big screen I was expecting a cross between a brat movie and Clint Eastwood What I got was a screen full of really adorable little kids three pretty nice performances by women a pretty good villain and Arnold Schwarzenegger mugging and straining and being fairly funny and appealing himself One of the treasures of KINDERGARTEN COP is the presence of Linda Hunt She s like tonight s blue moon she drives me crazy with admiration and her presence is way too rare Of course she won an Oscar for her male drag performance in THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY since then I ve seen her in SILVERADO which I loved and apparently no one bought tickets for and THE BOSTONIANS a sort of Masterpiece Theater piece for the silver screen and maybe something else but it ain t much In KINDERGARTEN COP she s almost pretty I ve always thought of her as beautiful but never pretty as the principal of Astoria Elementary I need hardly say she s mostly wasted here but I appreciate the gesture Another unlooked for casting treat was Carroll Baker who was making a run at sex goddess 30 years ago and now looks much the worse for the experience rather like in fact that wonderful actress who played Mrs Archer in THE MALTESE FALCON you know and you ll tell me by e mail please Baker excels as the wicked mother of the heavy whom she out villains He s played by Richard Tyson and he s quite enjoyable with his almost baby face and his domineering mom Pamela Reed is especially good as Arnie s undercover cop partner Her manner reminded me of some wonderful wise cracking comediennes from the days of screwball tough and caring like the recently deceased Eve Arden She does a not to be missed send up of Arnie s Austrian accent BTW Arnie s love interest is played by a mostly uninteresting Penelope Anne Miller There s nothing terribly wrong with her performance just nothing terribly right about it Arnie definitely has a flare for comedy and I don t mean those silly puns he to cap every action scene with His scenes with the children are actually endearing and he manages to outmug 30 6 year olds which is itself no mean feat I enjoyed seeing the North Coast locales and no one played hob with the geography in anything resembling the violence done to it by the cute robot movie shot in Astoria BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED For example the sun does not rise and set west of the Astoria Bridge in this movie My partner who really pissed and moaned about dragged to KINDERGARTEN COP laughed himself silly throughout and completely enjoyed himself You probably will too
0888,Home Alone,1990,I am a little leery of John Hughes films Hughes movies seem to be exclusively devoted to the topic of comfortable middle class white American family life not that there s anything inherently wrong with that it s just that when it s not properly handled it s about as interesting as Wonder Bread But good reviews tempted me to see HOME ALONE and I didn t regret it Okay in praising this film I have to throw out a number of warnings This is a feel good Christmas film with a nice neat homey message it s a candy cane and Christmas tree ornament sort of movie great it ain t But that said it is fairly impressive that Hughes and Chris Columbus could piece together such a movie with such craft that it not only avoids nauseating the audience but actually gets them rolling in the aisles at times The premise is simple two families with hot and cold running kids are taking off for Paris for Christmas One of the boys eight year old Kevin gets everybody mad at him the night before they leave so he s sent up to the attic bedroom to cool off There s a power outage during the night the clocks are all knocked out a mad scramble follows in the morning and due to the confusion and a slight case of mistaken identity they all drive off without Kevin Well more than that I will not say but the resulting story deftly weaves together a plot with a number of subplots a mean looking neighbor a tarantula a very bad old videotape and two nasty burglars who not only like stealing everything in sight but trashing everything when they leave with considerable economy into a smooth running whole The boy who plays Kevin is very good starting out as a peevish brat and then evolving to a new self reliance and even a little Gizmo Rambo militancy Okay entirely plausible it s not but this is the movies right When HOME ALONE gets rolling it achieves a Looney Tunes sense of timing and there is a fairly good sense of wit through the entire film Call it John Hughes Chris Columbus as Steve Spielberg Joe Dante And even if there is a message it is administered gracefully enough so that at the very worst you won t mind it too awfully much and maybe if you re corny enough in your heart of hearts you will nod your head and smile
0889,Edward Scissorhands,1990,Yep I m catching up on my movie going I have to with both HAMLET and AWAKENINGS opening up on the same weekend here next month Anyway Leslie and I went to see EDWARD SCISSORHANDS today the modern fable about the manufactured boy with scissors for hands It was a fine movie made with intelligence and wit Tim Burton scores another winner It won t make nearly the money that BATMAN did but at least BATMAN gave him the clout to continue making off beat films like Edward Like all the other Burton movies the film dances between the real world and someplace else entirely The real world here has the look and feel of California in the mid 60s Peg the friendly Avon lady played by Diane Wiest with just the right amount of Girl Scout finds Edward abandoned in a creepy old castle surrounded by wonderful topiary She takes Edward home and in the tradition of Chance the gardener from BEING THERE he agrees Edward is played by Johnny Depp and he gives a marvelous performance balancing his need for love against the fact he s been left alone for much of his life Like most movies of this type the alien has the biggest heart and displays the most humanity The supporting cast is kind of a Greek Chorus to the proceedings and act in concert throughout the movie Most of the supporting cast led ably by Kathy Baker and Conchetta Ferrell are bored 1960s housewives who spend their time entrenched in one another s lives Other members of the cast include Alan Arkin as Bill the archetypal 1960s Dad and Anthony Michael Hall remember when he was the skinny dweeb back in 16 CANDLES as Kim s menacing boyfriend Kim is played by Winona Ryder Peg Bill s all American daughter She is horrified by Edward at first but eventually becomes his friend Ryder is literally transformed in this movie from being a vacuous teenager early in the movie to taking enormous risks for Edward by the end of the film When you go see this movie remember that it is a fairy tale like Beauty and the Beast Tim Burton makes his points about humanity and isolation without beating you over the head with them This is one of the best movies I ve seen this year Kid rating Leslie hid at some of the parts where she felt Edward was going to be embarrassed you can see most of these moments coming The language was a little strong at times and there were some fights but no gore The movie may be a little slow for kids who need action to keep them interested in a film
0890,Bonfire of the Vanities The,1990,Capsule review DePalma echoes some things worth saying amplifies some things that are not twists the tone of the Wolfe book and makes the audience seasick in the process With over rated boxoffice stars such as Hanks Griffith and Willis he stacked the deck against himself Rating low 0 4 to 4 THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES is an occasionally audacious comedy with a large number of grievous faults Many of those faults would either disappear or would be outweighed by the film s virtues if this had been an original screenplay and there had not already been a novel with a similar plot and identical title written by Tom Wolfe As an adaptation of a novel Brian DePalma s film and Michael Cristofer s screenplay are a total botch As a film that stands by itself it has some very nice touches and is only a partial botch Any film that sets out to point out social ills and has something to offend nearly everybody cannot be all bad but a comedy that ends with some dignified character summing up the film and making a sermon for more decency at the end has a hard time being all good either In the 1950s and 1960s a Spencer Tracy or perhaps a Henry Fonda could sermonize and it would work Here it is like getting to the bottom of an ice cream sundae and finding a chunk of prime rib The story of THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has much the same world view as Billy Wilder s excellent ACE IN THE HOLE known on television as THE BIG CARNIVAL Each is a story of a human mishap and a large number of people professing only the best of intent swarming to it like sharks to serve their own self seeking ends In this case the mishap occurs when Wall Street wizard Sherman McCoy played by Tom Hanks is driving his mistress home from the airport misses an exit and must drive through an unfriendly part of the Bronx They are trapped in a probable mugging attempt They try to escape with mistress Maria Ruskin unknowingly backing McCoy s car into one of the muggers An alcoholic reporter Peter Fallow played by Bruce Willis desperately needing a big story blows this one into big headlines Also a black minister the Reverend Bacon played by John Hancock whose resemblance to the Reverend Al Sharpton is purely coincidental decides to use the incident for political grist Soon a whole circus of vultures is preying on the incident from all angles blowing it into a major racial incident And from all angles is exactly how DePalma chose to film BONFIRE DePalma has often used interesting camera angles to add atmosphere to a scene Here he does it by far too often and for often inexplicable reasons The audience watches a phone conference from the ceiling of a room looking straight down There is no explanation to the viewer of what he or she is doing on the ceiling The film actually has a cast which includes some very fine actors such as Morgan Freeman F Murray Abraham Donald Moffat Robert Stephens and Andre Gregory Medium weight notables include Saul Rubinek a clever comic actor misused here Then there are some dead weight actors apparently on hand for boxoffice value These include Tom Hanks Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith Perhaps a good director could squeeze a good performance if they were perfectly cast Here they are not and DePalma is not that good a director Hanks is wooden and evokes little emotion from the role Griffith is once again quite good at taking off her clothes but her ability to do a Southern sexpot named Maria is beyond her ability She does not look like a Maria and her Southern accent is forced The accent also probably changed in the course of filming and in her first scene in the film her voice sounded crudely overdubbed Then there is Bruce Willis His flat acting did not get in the way of the Die Hard films About the only film he would be well cast in would be THE BRUCE WILLIS STORY and even there it is questionable if he could really get into the character With more smoke than fire THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES never ignites I give it a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0891,Awakenings,1990,With the possible exception of THE GODFATHER PART III the most avidly awaited film of the winter season is probably Penny Marshall s AWAKENINGS Robin Williams stars in the fictionalized telling of a modern medical miracle performed by neurologist Oliver Sacks In the role of Dr Sacks whose name has been changed to Dr Malcolm Sayer is Robin Williams Whatever Williams is doing to improve his acting it is working very well his acting noticeably improves with each succeeding film he makes His Malcolm Sayer is a real departure Rather than his usual self assured characters Sayer is painfully introverted but caught up in an idea that becomes a dream and then a reality The film begins with a prologue in 1932 Young Leonard Lowe is having occasional fits of shaking in his right arm As time passes the fits are getting worse and Leonard is becoming seriously frightened by them Flash forward thirty seven years to 1969 Malcolm Sayer a researcher in neurology has spent the last five years working with earthworms in a project that failed Now he is looking for work and is hired to care for the incurably ill at a Bronx hospital a job he finds unnerving until his curiosity is aroused by several patients who appear to be living vegetables but who show odd signs of consciousness The common belief is that there cannot be any mental activity but only because the alternative is too agonizing to contemplate Sayer thinks that the symptoms he is seeing may be an extreme form of the same symptoms caused by an unrelated disease Parkinson s disease The drug L DOPA alleviates Parkinson s symptoms and Sayer thinks it may work on these patients The guess turns out to be correct and people who have been mental vegetables for three decades or more begin to wake up The film then becomes the dual story of Dr Sayer and the awakening patients particularly Leonard Lowe now played by Robert DeNiro Rarely does a film really bring home the value of being free to do what most of the world takes for granted In YENTL it was the right to learn CHARLY was a paean to the ability to think AWAKENINGS is about the ability to experience life at all to see the world around us DeNiro does a fine job playing the afflicted Lowe grasping for life when he can Julie Kavner is also notable as a nurse with faith in Sayer She is a fine character actress Disappointingly however the film never explores the question it raised so fervently How conscious are Sayer s patients What was their consciousness like in their vegetable state These questions are never satisfactorily answered AWAKENINGS is not a great film At times it is too pat At 121 minutes it is too short to do justice to the story of both the doctor and the patients My rating then is 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0892,Awakenings,1990,Penny Marshall the director of AWAKENINGS has a way with actors as anyone who has seen BIG will attest The actors in this case are Robin Williams as a painfully shy doctor in a so called chronic hospital in the Bronx Robert De Niro as one of his patients whom he awakens from a decades long absence Julie Kavner as Williams nurse and supporter an ensemble of wonderful character actors as other patients and finally real life patients in a real life hospital The hospital is not ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO S NEST sadism and power are not the problems when Williams shows up albeit reluctantly as the new doc on the block The problem is routine lack of curiosity acceptance of the received wisdom about warehousing the chronics presumably untreatable victims of unknowable mental disorders John Heard puts in an appearance as the stern slightly cynical head doctor whose job it seems is to rain on everyone s parade This is the same John Heard who played a similarly grim therapist in the Dyan Cannon movie I saw in previews earlier this last week This is a movie that I think will stay with one for a long time because the story is so intriguing and the performances so strong Williams discovers by accident that a group of patients who appear to totally out of communication with our world are maintaining slender threads of contact He deduces a connection with an encephalitis epidemic in the 1920s and a possible cure in a new drug L DOPA this being 1969 Williams experiments on De Niro who awakens to find that 30 years of his life have disappeared There is much of interest in the reactions of the patient and the family to this situation the loving mother who doesn t really want her little boy to not need her the man who finds that his family has disappeared in various way while he was away and so forth Williams plays against type and plays very well with hardly any of his comic persona peeping through He is never given a chance to extemporize a la GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and turns an understated disciplined performance Julie Kavner his nurse is her reliably wonderful self just as we ve seen in so many Woody Allen movies and elsewhere but she is pretty much playing her same stock character delightful as it is in contrast to Williams De Niro turns an amazingly detailed performance in a highly physical role of a man once total rigid like a statue then gradually loosening up learning to move again then as the cure wears off developing alarming tics and contortions of a body out of control The only problem with De Niro s performance is that is De Niro who may be too familiar a talent for us ever to forget that this is De Niro turning in another Oscar nomination performance Some of the character actors that I would like mention en passant include Anne Meara who was once I believe a stand up comic the late Dexter Gordon as the patient who will not or cannot speak except through his piano playing and a particularly splendid Alice Drummond who has one of the best lines in the movie about knowing that the year is 1969 but needing it to be 1926 the year she went to sleep Some have complained that the movie suffers from an unnatural symmetry with De Niro trapped in his body and Williams trapped in his shyness and the two of them awakening to life trying to help each other I find this to be a thematic strength in the movie the kind of quality that raises it above the disease of the month club It gives the movie meaning and resonance for all of us with message of appreciating life and having the courage to fight for it a message not that different from the carpe diem theme of DEAD POETS SOCIETY Robin Williams second best movie to date I recommend AWAKENINGS It is a strange and haunting story excellently presented You will very likely want to see more than once in fact
0893,Millers Crossing,1990,Since the movie reviews are normally handled by the more hirsute member of the Leeper Consortium it is rare indeed that I take pen in hand or in this case keyboard in lap to review a film But circumstances compel me to do so for MILLER S CROSSING What circumstances Well if I don t you won t know to drop everything and go see this movie Of course for many of you just the statement that this is another movie from Joel and Ethan Cohn RAISING ARIZONA BLOOD SIMPLE is enough And if I say Albert Finney is in it that will drag a few more of you down to your local cinema or not so local cinema this film is not exactly in what might be termed wide release But if that isn t enough how about the following Excellent acting especially by Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan and Joe Polito as Joe Caspar Wonderful cinematography by Barry Sonnenfield Beautiful Irish inspired score by Carter Burwell including the most perfect rendition of Danny Boy I have ever heard special screen credit was given to tenor William Preston Robertson for this Regarding the script you should be warned buy your popcorn and make your rest stops before the film starts If you leave the theater even for five minutes you will never figure out what s going on when you get back This is a very dense plot and much of what is important about the relationships between the various people is given in toss away lines This of course is a lot like real life where people generally do not say Well ever since Tom passed Bill over for that promotion Bill has had it in for Tom but rather things like You shouldn t be surprised at what Bill did after all remember that promotion Unfortunately this film has come and gone in most areas or more likely not come at all Luckily this means that it will probably be on videocassette in a few months While the wide screen is better for the appreciation of the technical details in this film the ability to pause play back and in general analyze the script may make up for that loss This is a definite must see film
0894,Come See the Paradise,1990,COME SEE THE PARADISE is a film about racism from a writer director who has been accused of making films with racist overtones MIDNIGHT EXPRESS MISSISSIPPI BURNING It is also about the internment of Japanese and Japanese Americans during the Second World War And it is a love story The film was created by Alan Parker and stars Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita as the lovers whose interracial marriage was opposed as much by her father as by the antimiscegenation laws of California They elope to Seattle to get married Seattle and Washington state being known as an unusual place even in the 1930s in such matters They become separated when the so called internment camps are opened and all persons of Japanese ancestry removed from the Pacific Coast states and the U S enters the war The pre Pearl parts of the movie present a wonderful evocation of Los Angeles old Little Tokyo with its mix of old and new country The movie has a lush detailed look to it In one of the Seattle papers there was story about the reactions of several local ex internees to seeing the film One person was quoted to the effect that the movie showed the camp surrounded by three barb wire fences just as his camp was in real life which detail delighted him for its authenticity The camp is never identified but I assumed it was meant to be Manzanar in the Owens Valley of California If it was Manzanar the site of which I visited twenty years ago its appearance in the film points up my only real dissatisfaction with the COME SEE THE PARADISE aside from the title which is an obscure reference to the movie house where Quaid worked for Tomita s father played by Sab Shimono was that to some extent it soft pedaled the camps and the situation Someday a really hard hitting dramatic movie as opposed to a documentary such as one done on the camps in the late Seventies will be made in the meantime this film is better than nothing a first step as it were in realizing the dramatic potential of this sad episode in U S history Much is glossed over such as dissent within the camps among the internees about their own loyalties There is in the interest of balance I suppose a brief conventional defense is offered by a minor white character However there is no doubt that the film views the camps as an injustice and a cruel punishment of innocent people From my friends who experienced the camps directly and from my own reading I know that only the smallest modicum of the pain and confusion and greed and meanness and little heroisms were depicted in this film The performances by Quaid Tomita and the other actors are uniformly excellent I ve never liked Quaid better and I want to see Tomita in lots more movies One of the pleasures of the movie is see many unfamiliar faces ethnic actors who are usually buried by the mostly lily white nature of main stream film making Indeed one especially delightful scene features one of Lily s brothers Lily being Tomita s character who is trying to be a film actor but can only get parts as Chinese houseboys Peter Lorre as Mr Moto shows up in camp show too The love story begins well but does tend to get lost in the hurly burly of the war which is probably what happened for a lot of people but which is not particularly good story writing or film making The two principals play off each other well in their love scenes but their love scenes are more tender than passionate for some reason Shall I say the film was not hard enough by half on America This is not an angry film but it is sympathetic and probably new information for a lot of people America seems to have made progress since those days even if much distance remains to be covered The film is strong the performances are strong the look is strong I am happy to recommend COME SEE THE PARADISE
0895,Awakenings,1990,It should be an interesting Academy Award ceremonies this year when the lead performers in the movies of Rob Reiner and Penny Marshall ex spouses who apparently do not get along well will probably win the top awards Kathy Bates for Misery and Robert DeNiro for AWAKENINGS AWAKENINGS is an extraordinary movie It has some parallels to RAIN MAN and CHARLY but it s much stronger Penny Marshall excels at setting a mood she makes you understand what it s like to be a child in the late 1920s in the first ten minutes of the film The action jumps ahead forty years to a dismal depressing psychiatric hospital in New York where Dr Sayer Robin Williams reluctantly takes a job as as researcher He s used to working with earthworms but sadly the long time catatonics he comes into contact with aren t much better off Dr Sayer believes he sees flickers of life behind the catatonic masks of his patients While some can bearly move they have some reflexes and a few seem to respond a little to their surroundings One patient Lucy catches her glasses and walks along the pattern on the floor only stopping when the pattern ends Another patient Leonard exhibits brain activity when his name is spoken during an EEG Sayer tries to stimulate these patients to prove that they comprehend what s happening to them and has mixed results Dr Sayer finds out that a drug L dopa has made improvements in the lives of Parkinson s patients and he gets permission to try it on a patient He chooses Leonard Robert DeNiro and Leonard gradually comes out of a thirty year sleep The relationship between Leonard and Sayer is remarkable Sayer is a very caring man but he s painfully shy and inhibited Leonard has been forced inward by neurological damage but he s determined to do whatever he can to experience everything he s missed Sayer helps Leonard cope with the missing years and Leonard helps Sayer learn as much as he can about the drug The most unbelievable part of the movie was the mass drug testing of the entire catatonic ward Maybe that s the way it really happened but the ward staff was incredibly stretched caring just for catatonics They were hopelessly overworked once fifteen neurologically damaged yet awake people populated their ward These scenes have the feel of Cocoon and were out of place with the rest of the movie There are many wonderful performances in this movie The actress who played Leonard s devoted mother gave co dependency a whole new meaning She s not evil and she s happy that Leonard is better but she has trouble coping with a fifty year old adolescent Julie Kavner did a nice turn as Sayer s supportive nurse Elinor And Alice Drummond as the gentle confused Lucy was also quite good The performances of Williams and DeNiro are extraordinary Williams for the subtleness and DeNiro for the range When performers are mismatched Cruise and Hoffman in RAIN MAN and Redford and Streep in OUT OF AFRICA spring instantly to mind the movie suffers But these performers work perfectly together Penny Marshall is one of the most important directors of the day Even with a weak script JUMPING JACK FLASH she consistently gets good performances from her performers and all her movies have lovely details The homes of the characters in Marshall movies look like places where people live And her vision of New York isn t quite as grand as Woody Allen s again it s a lived in place
0896,Awakenings,1990,Set in 1969 this is the story of a neurologist Robin Williams who attempts to awaken a group of patients in a mental hospital who have been in a catatonic state for 30 years or more due to having had encephalitis when younger The doctor believes that the new drug L Dopa which is being used to treat Parkinson s disease patients might help them as well Robert De Niro plays Leonard the first patient to try the treatment Leonard becomes a fully functional person again and the doctor expands the treatment to other patients Their joy at becoming normal again is short lived when Leonard starts regressing to his former state This movie plays fast and loose with your emotions but is not manipulative It is based on a true story but I don t know how much if any has been altered to make for a better story Although basically a drama there are many hilarious moments As Leonard De Niro gives a highly effective performance along the lines of Dustin Hoffman in RAIN MAN and Daniel Day Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT and he will no doubt be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar His joy at getting his life back is as compelling as his rage when he realizes he is losing it again As Robin Williams learns to tone down his manic comedic style he is becoming a better and better actor I think this is probably his best work since THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP Julie Kavner is the sympathetic nurse who believes in the doctor and becomes his biggest supporter among the otherwise doubting staff at the hospital There are lots of other well known character actors playing smaller roles too Director Penny Marshall who also did BIG demonstrates that she can do drama every bit as well as comedy Could be the first female Best Director Oscar nominee
0897,Hamlet,1990,Screenplay Christopher De Vore and Franco Zeffirelli based on Shakespeare Maybe you did your Master s thesis on Gertrude s libido Or maybe you never read HAMLET and never want to Whatever your background this version of HAMLET will give you something new Zeffirelli has taken a complex and ambiguous 4 5 hour play and transformed it into a 2 hour film Gone are subplots political intrigue secondary characters and much of the rich dialog that makes Hamlet the play so fascinating to read What s left A captivating tale so visually rich with such strong characters you can t help but be carried along The sets the costumes the lighting the sound all are perfect Faultless At a price tag of 15 5 million producer Lovell got one hell of a bargain The cast worked for pittance apparently they felt that the play s the thing And just how well did this cast do At worst moderately well At best phenomenally well One thing is clear the cast got to experiment and play and create new dimensions within their characters Each part except Horatio seemed to break new interpretive ground Sometimes it worked to great advantage For example Laertes Nat Parker is a younger more impressionable lad than I d ever imagined him That fits Sometimes though the new ground seems unwarranted For example Polonius Ian Holm seems more savvy than his lines would indicate he only plays the fool instead of being a fool This interpretation doesn t fit even though Holm does his usual excellent job in delivering a performance The ghost of King Hamlet played by Paul Scofield is less a frightening aberation than a haggard and sorrowful soul Scofield s rendition is particularly effective especially since Zeffirelli refused to use hokey special effects and decided the ghost should appear as a man Zeffirelli claims to have seen a ghost three times he says they re just there Guess you could say he plays them as he sees them Ophelia Helena Bonham Carter is a stronger smarter lass than is usually portrayed Her descent into madness is therefore inexplicable and absolutely does not work Also Bonham Carter s performance is unexpectedly weak in spots Because Zeffirelli s screenplay emphasizes her importance this weakens the film The only places the film dragged were her madness scenes And there were too many of those as long as I m complaining King Claudius Alan Bates is more a lovesick puppy than a calculating power hungry politician This is certainly new ground Personally I found this the most curious of all the portrayals Perhaps Bates and Zeffirelli felt that all the missing subplots took the oomph out of Claudius political maneuverings but Claudius the Cuddly never occurred to me as a possibility In rereading the play I still don t see it Does it work in the movie if you ve never read the play Yes Is that enough For those who haven t read it obviously yes For those who have probably not Hamlet Mel Gibson is a displaced son with all the confusion and frustration that implies Most of Shakespeare s dialog that explored Hamlet s displacement from the throne is missing from this version Therefore the only remaining displacement for Hamlet is as the major object of his mother s affection While other Hamlets have been contemplative and or indecisive this Hamlet is a prince of action trapped by circumstance into inaction Queen Gertrude Glenn Close is so surprisingly sensual that it ll catch you off guard even if you know it s coming so as to speak No wonder this Hamlet has trouble weaning himself Yes yes yes the basis for this interpretation is certainly in the script but Close pushes it much further than it s probably ever been taken before This isn t the regal queen of Elizabethan theatre This is a queen for a lusty king the medieval King of Denmark Speaking of lust and times medieval one thing Zeffirelli has most definitely accomplished is making the story of HAMLET a tale of real people folks with hopes and drives and hates and fears These aren t stiff serious solemn renditions Neither are they one dimensional However some purists accuse Zeffirelli of creating too simple and easy a version of HAMLET It is a short version though And rearranged Now it must be mentioned that there are at least four original versions of Shakespeare s HAMLET Scenes are shuffled lines are changed All by Shakespeare s own hand Zeffirelli contends that few audiences of Shakespeare s time would sit through nearly 5 hours of play and that the shuffled scenes and changed lines of the surviving versions are proof that Shakespeare himself played with the presentation of HAMLET Well yes but I doubt he left out key characters such as Fortinbras and I doubt he ever left Denmark without an apparent ruler in sight For those familiar with the play the movie may give you vertigo sometimes as it combines disparate scenes and condenses dialog and cuts particular lines out only to reinsert them in completely unexpected places It ain t pure but it sure is interesting I suspect that viewers who haven t read the play recently or never read it will find the film quite fluid and sensible I saw HAMLET during a Saturday matinee The audience was mostly quiet and attentive I say mostly because at least three teenage girls in different parts of the theatre giggled at the beginning of each of Gibson s soliloquies Behind me sat a couple in their late 40s or early 50s who consistently commented at the end of each soliloquy Wasn t that nice If it hadn t been for such bookending of the soliloquies they would have been seamless In other words they were soliloquies not Soliloquies Although I ve heard them delivered better I ve never heard them as well incorporated into the play When in doubt Gibson underplays There are so many good moments in this rendition Here s a short list The interactions between Hamlet and Gertrude Gertrude and Claudius and Claudius and Hamlet are more dynamic than I ve ever seen them before The get thee to a nunnery scene between Hamlet and Ophelia although oddly placed in time is extremely effective The wistful Yorick s skull scene is quiet and lovely The sporting contest between Hamlet and Laertes is done with more humor then more temper then more pathos than any other on film The moment Gertrude realizes she s been poisoned is more poignant than you ll ever see it again And Hamlet s shock at his own mortality is profoundly right For these moments and more like them for the thrill of the spectacle and for the majesty of the language get thee to a theatre and see HAMLET The film s the thing
0898,Hamlet,1990,I saw HAMLET this weekend and was favorably impressed It looks wonderful the costumes sets and scenery elicited oohs and ahs from the audience The performances are adequate Mel Gibson is much better than I would have expected and Glenn Close is quite good as well My caveats have to do with a certain lack of subtlety and the irritation I felt at the director s cutting rearrangement and truncation of certain scenes Hamlet s Get thee to a nunnery scene with Ophelia is set before his To be or not to be soliloquy except that the actual Get thee to a nunnery dialogue is grafted onto the Murder of Gonzago sequence I liked the original sequence better Hamlet s speech to the players is cut inexplicably as is the actual leaping into graves which punches up Ophelia s funeral Gibson is adequate when he is charging around ranting and having swordfights but he is less believable in more restrained moments The to be or not to be soliloquy is atmospherically set but Gibson s delivery struck me as that of someone who is delivering a pretty speech and not considering matters of life and death The director chose to develop a couple of scenes directly rather than by exposition through a character and let me say that the scene where a disheveled Hamlet has a wordless encounter with a bewildered Ophelia does not play well It elicited hoots of derisive laughter in the theater which was probably not the desired effect Maybe Shakespeare left it out for a reason maybe it didn t play well in the Sixteenth Century either I couldn t detect any real chemistry between Gibson and Helen Bonham Carter who plays Ophelia Ms Bonham Carter may have one of the prettiest faces on the planet but I was not overly impressed with her portrayal of Ophelia The friendship between Hamlet and Horatio is also given rather short shrift In summary a credible effort beautifully photographed and exceedingly atmospheric Well worth seeing but neither deep or subtle enough to qualify as a definitive version I hope some people who see it will be tempted to rent Olivier s version or make an effort to see the entire play somewhere
0899,Hamlet,1990,HAMLET is a superbly produced version of Shakespeare s play with strong performances all around Zeffirelli catches the look and feel of medieval Europe very well Zeffirelli s HAMLET opens at the funeral of King Hamlet and cuts quickly to a feast about two months later when Queen Gertrude has married her dead husband s brother King Claudius The old king Hamlet has been almost forgotten except by his grieving son Hamlet Nothing can rouse Hamlet from his stupor and seeing the ghost of his father unhinges him Hamlet seems unhinged by more than his father s ghost The spectre of sex also unhinges him He s torn by his feelings for Ophelia his feelings for his mother and his convictions that his mother has dishonored his father His madness is more than just a mask he s loosing it early in the film and spends the rest of the movie loosing it Mel Gibson gives a fine performance as Hamlet I particularly liked Helena Bonham Carter who gives a really strong performance as Ophelia Ophelia comes off as a very weak woman in most productions of HAMLET but in this version you can hear the passion in her voice Glen Close and Alan Bates portray Queen Gertrude and King Claudius as love sick adolescents but it works very well And Ian Holm is sufficiently dottering as the advice giving Polonius In HENRY V Kenneth Branagh kept the frame of a theatrical production around the film by starting the movie on a sound stage and keeping the Chorus Derek Jacobi in the film Zeffirelli completely divorces Hamlet from theater and opens up the play by adding a few short scenes that had only been described in the original While I tend to be a purist about original material the additions keep true to the spirit of the play My only reservation about the movie is that Gibson s performance is a little erratic His early scenes of madness are a tad too wild eyed He is brilliant late in the movie particularly in the climatic scene with Gertrude However Hamlet is a tough role to simply act in it requires a theatrical performance It s rated PG 13 I m not sure why the killings aren t particularly brutal there isn t much in the way of bad language and the sex is only implied Actually the country matters speech was said somewhat more laciviously than I d seen before and Hamlet attacks Gertrude in an almost rape like manner Our ten year old begged to go so we took her Unfortunately she was rather bored by it I forgot to note earlier that she enjoyed AWAKENINGS but is now worried about getting encephalitis If your pre teen wants to go you might suggest they watch Zeffirelli s ROMEO AND JULIET on tape first to see if they can follow it HAMLET is definitely worth seeing on a big screen There are some lovely sweeping shots that will get lost on TV It s also worth paying full price for I d give it an 8
0901,Not Without My Daughter,1991,I ve seen the movie and I ve read the Reader s Digest version of the book which truncates the book from 400 to about 250 pages Regarding the book Reading through the passages of the book one can see the author s resentment towards Iranians as Reza Taheri says But this is understandable You keep somebody by force in a strange country subject her to beating imprison her in the house and still want her to be unbiased in evaluating Iranians You can see this kind of resentment in many people with some degree or another In Pakistan for instance the Iranian refugees dislike Pakistanis very much The reason is because they are having a hard time away from home over there This resentment of Betty Mahmoody goes as far as describing Iranian restrooms as holes in the ground The movie however is more even handed though not quite The movie starts with a beautiful scenery of a green forest by a small lake The birds are singing and the atmosphere is peaceful and relaxed By the lake there is a summer house If you have not read the book but know the movie is about Iran you are led to believe the scene is in Iran Then you see the title Alpha Michigan 1984 Anyway I shouldn t spoil the movie for those who want to see it I found that part of the movie which was supposed to show Iran quite accurate with exception of some technical points Right after getting out of Mehr Abad airport Moody is surrounded by his Hezbollahi family and at their arrival at the house the family sacrifices a sheep for them a common practice in Iran Later in some other scene a car belonging to revolutionary guards stops and four people two men and two women jump out of the car with machine guns swearing at Betty for not covering all of her hair This was perhaps the most realistic scene in the movie Some parts of the movie is exaggerated For example in one scene they showed an old crumbling building which was supposed to be Hosseyie Ershad I have seen the mosque with its marble floor and beautiful Persian carpets That old building did not at all resemble Hosseynie Ershad The other exaggeration was the sheep on the streets of Tehran The viewer could see them up to the end of the movie A big portion of the movie is concentrated on Betty s escape therefore it shows some Iranian heroes who help her escape One other thing about the film the guy who was playing the husband was not Iranian and it was sort of funny for Iranian audience to see him speak Persian Dave Elliott our fellow netter writes about the movie The culture is presented as simply being very different than American culture not better or worse What is Iranian culture Do we have a homogeneous entity as Iranian culture I don t think so First we have diverse ethnic groups such as Turks Kurds Turkmans Baluchies Arabs Lors etc Each group has its own culture which might be similar to others in some aspects yet it might be different from the rest in other aspects Second in any ethnic group or even cities we have what I may call sub_cultures For example in Tehran the culture of southern part of the city is far different from that of the northern residents Yet another category might be the difference between religious and non religious people in the same city A marriage between a religious and a non religious party especially after the revolution could be disastrous I ve met some of my fellow Iranians who call Mrs Mahmoody a liar and some other names Then we see on the net I have not seen the movie and most probably will not either and I am very happy that this movie NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER might function as a tool to increase our awareness and sensitivity toward the dirty face of subtle and yet real vilification of all Iranians along a same line as Arabs Hispanics and other ethnic groups We must be aware of these movies T V programs I m afraid the solution is not not seeing the movie but this movie might function as a tool to increase our awareness of the dirty parts to our culture s yes they exist Unfortunately there are thousands of Iranian women who are beaten by their husbands and have unlike Mrs Mahmoody nowhere to go Let us have some self criticism of our culture s and ourselves Let us not get so defensive and let us admit the dark parts of our culture s and try to overcome and evolve them for the benefit of the next Iranian generations BTW The account fekr nevisandeh translates to the thought of the writer and is an anonymous posting facility Moderator
0902,Godfather: Part III The,1990,SUMMARY A grand slam finale to the Michael Corleone saga Not for all tastes and requires some homework but those who expend the effort will be well rewarded The best of the trilogy easily one of the year s best films and with some actors best ever performances With all the hoopla surround the Christmas release of G3 I took advantage of HBO s two night back to back showings on G1 and G2 in December Not surprisingly all video stores have been out of both for the last several weeks Having never seen either I was looking forward to catching up on two Best Picture Oscar winners Perhaps it was because I m not big on gangster Mafia movies I absolutely hated GOODFELLAS or perhaps they lose something when viewed on TV but my opinion of G1 and G2 was that they were good but not great So I was not terribly excited about another two hours and forty minutes more of G3 But I was greatly surprised and concurred with the Chronicle If GODFATHER III were simply a worthy sequel that would have been enough But this lushly photographed brilliantly acted and wonderfully entertaining movie has its own claims to uniqueness It s the most thoughtful of the three films and its climax brings the entire series into sharper focus Go rent G1 and G2 before seeing G3 One of my friends who saw it with me had not seen G1 or G2 since they were released in 72 and 74 and was terribly lost keeping track of who was doing what to whom G2 has many passing references to characters and events from G1 and G2 see below for a brief summary Don t expect an action packed shoot out type movie Coppola deliberately develops the story at a slower pace as we study each character s motivations It gradually builds to an edge of the seat climax Find a theater showing G3 in 70mm with surround sound I can t recall any other movie where the improved sound system enhanced the movie as much The movie s climax which takes place at an opera house is especially effective because of it WARNING If you plan on renting G1 and G2 and don t want the plots spoiled for you don t read any further Part 1 During the mid 1940s we meet Vito Corleone Marlon Brando and his four children Sonny James Caan Fredo John Cazale Michael Al Pacino and Connie Talia Shire Attorney Tom Hagen Robert Duvall protects the family s legal interests Part 3 It is now 1979 and as Michael approaches retirement he wants nothing more than to make the family completely legitimate He divests his gambling business to other families and donates millions of dollars to Catholic charities Al Pacino Michael shines and will undoubtedly be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar You can feel his frustration when he says Just when I think I m out they pull me back in He even takes on the gravelly voice of Brando s Vito There are two particular scenes that are brilliant one where he confesses his sins for the first time in years and another where he has a diabetic stroke Andy Garcia Vincent is great he is the very embodiment of Sonny Corleone hot headed temperament and mannerisms This could well be the turning point in his career If there should be any future Godfather movies they will no doubt revolve around his character Talia Shire is deliciously evil as the conniving Connie always counseling Vincent on how to get in Michael s good graces In the end she even gets to dispatch one of the family enemies in her own special way Sofia Coppola Francis Coppola s daughter does just fine as Mary despite many critics caustic comments Not an outstanding performance but solid and believable Eli Wallach almost steals the whole movie as an old friend of the family Don Altobello who is always trying to keep the peace Great fun Diane Keaton Kay is one of the movie s major disappointments in my mind It almost seems as if she is overacting to justify her top billing for what is a pretty small role George Hamilton is merely passable replacing Robert Duvall as the family attorney Duvall reportedly wanted twice what Paramount offered and wanted a larger role so his Tom Hagen character was killed off between G2 and G3 John Savage has a throwaway role as Tom Hagen s son and has nothing to do with the plot as far as I could tell Likewise Bridget Fonda has a brief scene playing a reporter seduced by Vincent and is not seen again Don Novello better known as Father Guido Sarducci plays it straight as the family s PR man attempting to convince a disbelieving press of the family s respectability
0903,Godfather: Part III The,1990,I finally got around to seeing THE GODFATHER PART III and I m not happy It s is much much worse than the first two films And worse is the term not not as good I thought the first two films were brilliant while the third is easily the worst film Coppola has ever made even counting that trivial little segment of NEW YORK STORIES The only good points of this film in my opinion were Andy Garcia s dynamic performance good production design and an acceptable performance from Pacino The flaws on the other hand are legion starting as bad films invariably do with the script THE GODFATHER PART III is not nearly as well written as the first two films The dialog is weaker the story is not well integrated into the world built in the first two films some of the characters are inconsistently written few of them are very interesting Some characters only seem present because they were in the other films notably Kay Diane Keaton s character One very serious problem in the script is that we do not get enough explanation of why Michael isn t the man he was at the end of the last film Hints yes but not a real explanation Since the whole series is more about him than anyone else that s a major flaw More or less the last thing we see in THE GODFATHER PART II is Michael contemplating the murder of his brother and coming to terms with it by banishing all his feelings In this film his son tells him that he is leaving law school to become a singer and Michael gives the same song and dance that a stockbroker would give his son in the same circumstances There is no trace of the powerful amoral man who would do anything to get his way in this scene Where d he go Either Michael should continue to behave in the same way or we must be told what caused him to change In this film Kay tells Michael that she thinks he s more dangerous than ever now that he s respectable Why He seems far less dangerous in this film Is Kay supposed to be wrong Is it supposed to be a foreshadowing of an explosion of violence and evil from Michael There is no support for either of these possibilities or any other that I can see except perhaps that Coppola and Puzo thought it was a good line The script is also lacking in the atmosphere and strongly written scenes that were so much a part of the earlier films The opera sequence at the end of the film is an inferior retread of the climax to THE COTTON CLUB There is no scene in this film equal in its writing to the scene in THE GODFATHER PART II where Hagen explains to one of the family s betrayers why he must commit suicide or the scene where Michael tells his brother that he knows of his betrayal or the scene in Part I where the Godfather dispenses favors at his daughter s wedding The script also provided too little material for us to get any feel for the world of the Mafia as the first two scripts did so well It didn t substitute any feel for the world of high finance or the Vatican either Talia Shire s character is especially harmed by this failure of background She is forever going on about saving the family What family There s Pacino Garcia Pacino s two children herself and about three underlings Pacino s kids don t want to have anything to do with the Mafia so who are they saving the family for Contrast this to the first film in which Brando was surrounded by sons cousins and retainers in a true if perverse sense he was a feudal lord who watched out for all of the peasants in his barony In this film Pacino is a businessman with only a shell of a company The acting is surprisingly poor As mentioned Andy Garcia is dynamic and alive and Pacino is fine given the scripted limitations But the rest of the cast contains hardly a decent performance much less a brilliant one Eli Wallach left tooth marks all over the scenery Joe Mantegna gave the first bad performance I ve ever seen from him He was admittedly hampered by some of the script s poorest lines George Hamilton had nothing to do and did it drably Talia Shire careened between different interpretations of her character which mostly didn t fit in with what we already know of her from the earlier films There isn t a single bad performance in either of the first two films and there are several in this one Disturbingly the minor characters who seemed so flavorful in the first two films dissolve into indistinguishable mush in this film a combined flaw in writing and casting As far as Sofia Coppola goes well let s just say I considered the climax of the opera scene to be a happy ending In addition to problems of script and acting THE GODFATHER PART III is perhaps the worst edited major film I ve seen in many years probably a result of the rush job necessary to meet the December 25th deadline THE GODFATHER PART III is choppy Scenes do not flow naturally together Coppola intercuts between simultaneous action without rhyme or reason A notable example the scene in which Andy Garcia is playing pool and is interrupted by Talia Shire This scene is unnecessarily cut in half by a sequence in which Michael Corleone masquerades as Kay s driver so he can show her Sicily Why the cut Well Garcia has a reaction to the car starting up and driving away and unless the other scene is interposed the reaction makes no sense However the interruption robs Garcia s scene of the power it needs With sufficient time I m sure the editors could have worked around the problem possibly cutting Garcia s reaction and placing the scene between Michael and Kay elsewhere That s the sort of thing that happens when you have a rush job There are other examples as well A more serious flaw is the frequent use of fades to black At least four or five times a scene ends we fade to black and we are somewhere else dealing with entirely different thematic material These fades cause the rhythm of the film to stop dead Using a fade to black as a period at the end of a cinematic sentence is a perfectly valid technique if you really do want to pause and indicate that a major change is about to take place but that isn t what the makers of this film seem to have in mind Rather they need to end one scene and start another and they didn t have time to do anything good so they faded to black Whenever they do any momentum the film has built disappears and they do it quite a lot The music for this film another strong point in the earlier films is terrible Coppola s hiring his father to do the score was an even worse idea than hiring his daughter to play a leading role The only decent parts of the score are those written by Nino Rota for the first film Much of the rest of the music is banal and sometimes inappropriate And even the direction is poor I mean really a spinning newspaper stopping to reveal a headline Followed by a shot of newspapers coming off the presses so we could see another headline These were cliches in the 1940 s Relying on them to provide us with information is almost cynically lazy I never thought Coppola would try to use this kind of technique seriously This one is so old that it isn t even any use for a joke Coppola also seems to have lost his eye for shots I liked very much a shot showing Raf Vallone and Pacino separated by an urn during Pacino s confession It nicely commented on the content of the scene with the physical separation between the calm peaceful cardinal and the suffering troubled Mafioso But that is the only memorable scene other than possible dropping one of the murder victims down a stairwell and the opening sequence in which the camera travels over the wreckage of the Corleone s vacation house by the lake That very promising opening suggests that we will see the corresponding moral ruin of the man who owns the house But we don t Instead we get a kinder gentler Michael Corleone who for reasons unclear from anything we ve seen in the earlier films decides he wants to get out of the crime business The laziness of the direction is also clear in all of the film s other flaws including the acting and the editing Particularly ludicrous is the scene at the very end in which the aged Michael dies in his chair in a long shot He drops the orange slumps over he s dead so far so good Then he falls out of the chair I was reminded of the guy on LAUGH IN who used to ride around on a tricycle and then fall over sideways Not very subtle Coppola The photography isn t bad but lacks the rich texture of the first two films Shadows played a much more important role in those films Here not very much happens in shadow The light isn t as golden perhaps appropriate for a film with a more modern setting but definitely not as pretty The production design is as luxurious as ever and cannot be faulted It s nice I guess that someone in the production is doing his job Overall I m not sure whether I regard THE GODFATHER PART III as a major disappointment or not I was always somewhat dubious about the promise of the film particularly since Coppola did it for the money not because he really wanted to show us more The mixed reviews led me to believe that the film might contain something of value but I was wrong If you feel that you must be a completist about this series I guess you should see THE GODFATHER PART III But if you are looking for entertainment in a film or artistic quality look somewhere else There s actually some justice to the fact that HOME ALONE will probably gross two to three times as much as this film
0904,Hamlet,1990,Laurie Mann writes HAMLET is a superbly produced version of Shakespeare s play with strong performances all around Zeffirelli catches the look and feel of medieval Europe very well I don t know if Laurie s saying the two things are linked but my personal taste runs in the other direction I would have preferred modern dress We ve got too many Hamlet s leaping around in doublet and hose as it is Actually I knew from previous experience with Zeffirelli Shakespearean films to expect huge cuts Renaissance medieval dress setting and a more traditional interpretation I bet 4 1 odds with myself that Jones Oedipal interpretation would rear its hoary old head Within these limitations he does an excellent job I just don t like those limitations Especially when it comes to knee jerk interpretation Mel Gibson gives a fine performance as Hamlet Yes definitely I have to admit I underestimated him and he does a great job with speaking the lines with understanding clarity and above all acting through them A really good job I just don t like the way Zeffirelli set most of the soliloquies away from the rest of the action Helena Bonham Carter did a great mad scene Glenn Close was a wonderfully sympathetic Gertrude and Alan Bates had a lot of fun being a slightly gluttonous and lustful Claudius For the other Zeffirellia Shakespeare watchers out there John McEnery has had a bit of a comedown from Mercutio to Osric and Osric doesn t even get to blow hot and cold while toad eating Hamlet with the hat Zeffirelli completely divorces HAMLET from theater and opens up the play by adding a few short scenes that had only been described in the original While I tend to be a purist about original material the additions keep true to the spirit of the play Zeffirelli did the same thing in TAMING OF THE SHREW e g the Wedding he s fearless when it comes to adapting Shakespeare for his needs And he tends to make good cuts I think most of the cuts were probably necessitated by the commercial need to bring in a film under three hours So Act I Scene i goes because all the action in it is later related by Horatio and then repeated Of course the joke of Hamlet saying Methinks I see my father and Horatio yelping Where my lord is then lost but it s worth it for the amount of time gained Even splitting Act I Scene ii into three or four smaller bits is good because it shifts the focus onto the individual characters of Hamlet Gertrude and Claudius which the audience needs to know And naturally he goes for the more common cuts Fortinbras the dumbshow before the play within the play and Laertes and Hamlet both jumping into Ophelia s grave in a macho display of I loved her more than you did are all gone But by the time Hamlet gets to To Be or Not to Be in a crypt entirely divorced from where it s supposed to be i e in a hall where he knows he s being overheard by Claudius and Polonius and where Ophelia is laid as bait to trap him which was about three scenes earlier in which he doesn t launch into Get thee to a nunnery and then about four or five scenes later when the play within the play is just about to start which by the way we don t know is of Hamlet s authorship because the Speak the speech bit was cut and Hamlet says That s a fair thought to lie between maid s legs shocking all those people who thought this was high art and then turns to Ophelia and starts railing Get thee to a nunnery which was from the scene before which didn t have the soliloquy you start to wonder if maybe there wasn t a little too much violence done to the text Call me an anal retentive Shakespeare snob I am one anyways but I missed The rugged Phyrrus bit and then the subsequent necessary line cuts from Oh what a rogue and peasant slave I like the jokes in HAMLET I missed it when Zeffirelli cut What s his weapon Rapier and dagger That s two of his weapons because he wanted the final scene to look like a bash em up fight duel with big blades and then climax with them swinging two big swords apiece rather than have anything so finicky as a four bladed fencing match with wimpy foils and daggers I couldn t help snorting when Laertes after slicing Hamlet has to tell him the sword is unbated Yeah right like Hamlet hasn t figured that it s not a blunt blade All of Zeffirelli s choices are made for a purpose and this movie is admirably straightforward and powerful in telling the story of HAMLET But while the movie is undoubtedly HAMLET it s HAMLET with most of the texture all puns intended rubbed off It s fun it s worth seeing but be aware that it s a simplification At least now people are primed to see Stoppard s ROSENCRANZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD
0905,Hamlet,1990,Capsule review Unexceptional is really the word for the new HAMLET from Franco Zeffirelli Gibson is okay as Hamlet but is nothing startling Glenn Close is the only actor experimenting with her role The scenery is nice but this much trimmed re telling is nothing Shakespeare would feel bad for missing Rating 1 4 to 4 Generally in reviewing a film first consideration is given to how good the story is It is a little tougher to review a Shakespeare film because whatever the good qualities of the story itself or even the dialogue it is pointless to praise the gentleman who contributed them HAMLET is a film that gets no points positive or negative for story The question is not whether HAMLET is a good story but rather whether this is a good HAMLET First of all this is not so much HAMLET as HAMLETTE Every line that s there is Shakespeare s but not every line that is Shakespeare s is there Franco Zeffirelli tells the story slowly taking time to bathe the viewer in the impressive scenery then cutting much of the play half I am told to make it fit into two and a quarter hours As one expects from a Zeffirelli film it is lushly filmed though perhaps not so much as some of his other films particularly the ones set in Italy This film has less of the soft focus of say ROMEO AND JULIET The scenery is mostly in stoney castles shot with a much harder focus Some of the exteriors look much like the real Elsinore but the Scottish castles used for the interiors has far too much Celtic looking decoration Ennio Morricone s score is not only much less intrusive than usual it seems nearly non existent Surprisingly few scenes have any score at all The important question is whether a popular actor like Mel Gibson can play a good Hamlet In many ways Hamlet is very much a character of the 1990s He has horrible family problems he screws up his love life and he has absolutely atrocious audience manners Gibson s Hamlet however is surprisingly uninteresting and not particularly relevant to either Hamlet s time or our own Gibson s performance makes no statement about the Dane that was not on the printed page By contrast Glenn Close s Gertrude takes the incest a step further than Shakespeare s did by apparently being attracted to her own son Alan Bates plays new King Claudius not very notably and even the great Paul Scofield seems unable to do much with his role Helena Bonham Carter of A ROOM WITH A VIEW and LADY JANE needs a new character to play This film has too many problems to become the definitive HAMLET the way Zeffirelli s is the best known version of ROMEO AND JULIET It is simply an okay retelling of the classic story Rent HENRY V instead I give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0906,White Fang,1991,Walt Disney Studios continues to make films that old Walt would have been proud of They are better films than Disney himself was making toward the end of his life While it is not necessarily true of the Touchstone line when a film comes out under the Disney title it is worth seeing Films such as NEVER CRY WOLF THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN and WHITE FANG have more in common than just the curious link that they all try to vindicate wolves they have good scripts with well crafted dialogue Disney s staff may be among the most accomplished nature photographers in the world And they appear to be the only studio that seems to make sure all their prints are on high quality blemish free film While it probably will not stand with some of their better efforts of the past WHITE FANG is fully up to Disney s photographic and writing standards WHITE FANG has a decent story which takes some of its ideas from the novel by Jack London Perhaps the film s biggest failing is that it really is very different from the novel While the novel linearly follows the story of the dog the screenplay follows two often crossing lines the story of the dog and the story of a young prospector who has come to the Klondike to inherit his father s gold mine Ethan Hawke plays Jack Conroy who slowly learns to survive in the wild with the reluctant tutelage of Alex Larson played by Klaus Maria Brandauer Disney apparently is not ready yet to have animals as his main characters the way Annaud did in his film THE BEAR Speaking of that film incidentally Bart the Bear who played the big strong silent hero of THE BEAR gets to try his paw at playing a villain in WHITE FANG He has a high old time chewing up the scenery in a small but important part and like Brandauer seems a little too big for his role as written Conroy arrives in the Klondike and climbs the Golden Stairway in an impressive and spectacular scene At the top he teams up with friends of his father Larson and a delightful old prospector played by Seymour Cassel Then in a sequence that does not quite make geometric sense they cross country but repeatedly run into first a she wolf and later her cub The hazards of surviving in the spectacular desolation are well represented in the film The nature photography is flawless with huge vistas of craggy blue ice Against this backdrop you see the wolves playing and dancing Unfortunately not all the photography is as original as it usually is in a Disney film Whole sequences seem borrowed from THE BEAR and one nice underwater shot was inspired by THE BLACK STALLION The score by Basil Poledouris who also scored the current film FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER is very good and in some ways reminiscent of his best score CONAN THE BARBARIAN My rating for WHITE FANG is a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0907,Grifters The,1990,Capsule review A lot of impressive names cooperated to create a surprisingly unimpressive film noir crime story This film pulls its punches by throwing in absurdities at the wrong moment and has at least one surprisingly vicious scene Rating 1 4 to 4 A grifter is a con man nobody calls them con persons someone who makes a living by fraud There are little cons and big cons A small con will net pocket change and maybe a busted jaw A big con can net in the millions and can get you killed Con men have been portrayed as likable in THE FLIM FLAM MAN and THE STING They are seen with a kind of dark awe in HOUSE OF GAMES Perhaps the most realistic view and by far one of the dirtiest is in THE GRIFTERS anew film with a superb pedigree that still disappoints What is the pedigree It was a novel by Jim Thompson a crime story writer who is only now after his death reaching his greatest popularity The film adaptation of his AFTER DARK MY SWEET is also in current release Thompson also occasionally did screen work co scripting one of the great films of all time Kubrick s PATHS OF GLORY Thompson s GRIFTERS was adapted for the screen by Donald Westlake himself a popular crime novelist and author of books such as BANK SHOT The film was produced by Martin Scorsese who directed film noir crime films such as MEAN STREETS and TAXI DRIVER and directed by Stephen Frears who also directed MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID and DANGEROUS LIAISONS As close as it would be possible to have a spectacular film noir film this is it Still this turns out to be just an adequate crime story little more The film concerns three grifters First there is 25 year old Roy Dillon played limply by John Cusack Then there is his 39 year old mother Lily Dillon played by the oddly mis cast Anjelica Huston Unusually mis castings have a pretty person cast where someone grittier is needed Here it may be the reverse Lily looks old enough to be Roy s mother The story calls for her to be Roy s mother without looking it She is supposed to look young and attractive and while Ms Huston really is the right age for the role she was born in 1952 she looks too old for the role and dressing her in a sexy dress and stiletto heels does not do it The third vertex of this dark triangle is Myra played by Annette Bening a bouncy young grifter with a background for big grifts Often her bounces are out of her clothes and onto a bed particularly when big money is involved She wants to partner up with Roy in more ways than one but she and Lily are just too similar and know too much about each other to get along I will try to avoid spoilers in what follows but there will be minor spoilers What is wrong with this story Why is this only an adequate crime story First the plotting is less complex than you would expect You have three devious characters and one would expect a really devious plot but it fails to materialize There are no big surprises in the plotting The viewer never really feels grifted by the script Second parts of this film really do not make sense The climax of the film is contrived and if it is not a physical impossibility it is a very strong physical improbability In another incident a bullet is fired and the police conclusion about the incident seems completely inconsistent with what would have been the trajectory of the bullet It is almost comical to imagine the incident as the police must be picturing it to create the required trajectory While the previous problem in physics is probably from the novel the trajectory problem seems to be Frears not thinking out the scene ahead of time and could have been avoided This is not a bad film it just fails to materialize into a very good one The scenes that should carry the dramatic impact lose it because of small absurdities In my opinion this film has been over rated It would have made a decent black and white in the 1940s and it still is just about that good My rating is 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0908,Flight of the Intruder,1990,Capsule review Pretty pictures stupid story The air war of a previous conflict is occasionally entertaining to watch but the plot is cliched as are most of the characters This film s only chance is to follow the current wave of interest in military equipment Rating low 0 Had I not actually seen a copy of the book FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER by Stephen Coonts I would have had a hard time telling if this was a very weak story given classy military equipment photography and quality special effects treatment or if this was just a collection of classy military equipment photography and quality special effects tied together by a very weak excuse for a story During World War II a lot of B war movies carried stories just as good to the bottom half of double bills We are talking HELLCATS OF THE NAVY level plotting here In 1972 Vietnam we have an aircraft carrier ruled over by a cigar chewing mean as a junkyard dog but heart of gold sort of commander Danny Glover plays the Black commander with the unlikely name Frank Camparelli One of his bright young pilots Jake Grafton played by the uninteresting Brad Johnson agonizes over the loss of his bombardier The companion is lost in a raid that accomplishes nothing besides adding visual interest to the opening credits Grafton wants to go on a super special raid of his own devising But this raid is directly contrary to orders His top gun replacement bombardier Virgil Cole played by Willem Dafoe says absolutely not Does Jake get to make his super special raid on North Vietnam And if he does what is the Navy s reaction The weak story is however punctuated by pretty pictures of planes helicopters and aircraft carriers to keep the audience watching If this film stands any chance with audiences it is in the fortuitous timing of this film coincident with a sudden upsurge of interest in technical weaponry Indeed many people may find events in the Middle East resonating with attitudes in this film On the other hand maybe some people would prefer to stay home and watch technical weaponry on television FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER is directed by John Milius who is specializing in gutsy films like APOCALYPSE NOW which he wrote CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN The score is by Basil Poledouris the gifted composer of the scores for the Conan films who seems repeatedly associated with films with right wing themes Poledouris scored RED DAWN AMERIKA and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER is linked in advertising with THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER but it falls well short of that film s interest value and quality My rating is a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0909,Flight of the Intruder,1990,Are movie audiences willing to pay good money for something they can watch on the nightly news If the movie s lack of success in its early weeks is any indication FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER has already crashed and burned The movie is based fairly accurately on Steven Coonts novel of the same name If you read the book you might not want to see the movie or at least be ready for disappointment The movie follows the book until just about the end and then things change dramatically If you haven t read the book do yourself a favor it s much better than the movie Lieutenant Jake Cool Hand Grafton Brad Johnson follows the footsteps of all the classic heroes So what is the problem with Jake or is it Johnson He never seems to live up to the super hero image he was portrayed to be in the book I kept wanting to accept him as the hero but this never happened If Johnson had more of a domineering personality like Tom Cruise in TOP GUN for example then Jake might live up to he the hero the movie wants him to be Danny Glover plays the tough Flight Commander Frank Camparelli although he too is hard to accept as a character in a serious role In my opinion the only strong performance in this movie comes from Willem Dafoe as Virgil Cole Jake s renegade bombardier Dafoe seems to cast himself into the Vietnam era movies perhaps contributing in part to his success in this film One disappointing part of the movie is that few moments are devoted to the A 6A Intruder s breathtaking takeoffs and landings from the deck of the aircraft carrier Despite the fact that the movie was actually filmed on an aircaft carrier this enormous resource was never exploited FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER is second in a generation of high tech thrillers The first being Tom Clancy s HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER ironically by the same producers Consequently it is not too surprising that FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER suffers the same technical misgivings that the Hunt for Red October had the aphrodisiac that pulls readers to Coonts and Clancy s books is the great attention to detail Coonts painfully describes evading a surface to air missile SAM from Page 6 of FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER There s the SAM Two o clock Jake fought back the urge to urinate Both men watched the white rocket exhaust while Grafton squeezed the chafe release button on the right throttle with his forefinger Each push released a small plastic container into the slipstream where it dispersed a cloud of metallic fibers the chaff that would echo radar energy and form a false target on the enemy operator s radar screen The pilot carefully nudged the stick foreword and dropped to 200 feet above the ground He jabbed the chaff button four more times in quick succession The movie shows us this high tension scene in five seconds There is no explanation to what is actually happening I found myself running home to read the book again to satisfy the questions the movie left unanswered The movie plays with two subplots and I m not sure if they really belong in the film In the book they play a more important role in breathing life into the characters in the movie they simply get in the way Jake s relationship with Callie Rosanna Arquette seems superficial and unimportant where in the book Callie plays a pivotal role in saving Jake s sanity and the Mad Shitter never really lives up to the suspense it could have been The success of the techno thriller novel is that a reader can fly an A 6A Intruder just by reading along The movie fails on this level Maybe I simply expected too much from a good book
0911,Air America,1990,AIR AMERICA is a wonderful movie which actually has the distinction of making me laugh out loud in the cinema I went to see AIR AMERICA having seen the trailer and thought it might be a little light relief on a Friday evening The movie is based in Laos while Tricky Dicky President Nixon was telling the whole world that the US government was not in Laos Of course this sounds slightly odd as we can see a vast collection of aircraft and government troops exactly where they re not supposed to be The government is in fact in Laos but employing a collection of civilian pilots to fly supplies to the army the US would like to win the war As a sideline the US major is running a heroin factory and using the pilots to fly the opium around This then gives a nice set of interactions that the film uses for both comic effect and also to serious and emotional effect which the film just about brings off The dialogue is cleverly written and has some beautiful lines which are extremely funny Characters other than the two main ones are not explored then tend to be there for contrast and provide the setting for the scene The story is enough to make the film move along at the right pace and it is easy to follow what s going on and why good news for Friday evening I really enjoyed this movie it fitted in exactly with what I wanted to see It is far more funny than the trailer would lead you to believe
0912,Hamlet,1990,Zeffirelli s ROMEO AND JULIET was what sparked my interest in Shakespeare over 20 years ago so I was looking forward to this very much I thought this film version was more than good but less than great For the record it might be worth noting that I ve never seen a production of HAMLET even the Olivier film version though I have read the play a couple of times and studied it as part of a college course The heart of the production is in the performances and here the film gets generally high marks Gibson was on the whole adequate It comes as no surprise that his better moments in the film were those moments of action and passion I mean strong emotion here not romancing but I found his quiet moments too dry and uninvolving Most of his soliloquies came off relatively poorly the most notable exception in my mind being the conscience of the King soliloquy The worst aspect of his performance to my mind was the fact that he almost always came off as second banana to me whenever he was playing against someone else Even the lesser parts such as Horatio and Laertes seemed better to me than Gibson s Hamlet But as I said in the scenes that required more action and emoting he worked better with his best scene being the aftermath of the play within a play Glenn Close however was wonderful as Gertrude playing her as a sincere and passionate woman who was unfortunately totally without a clue about anything which is a nice switch from the usual interpretation of Gertrude as being co conspirator with Claudius I ve never been a particularly big Close fan but this is the best of her performances that I ve seen My favorite of the cast was Ian Holm as Polonius I d never pictured Polonius as the comic relief character of the play but Holm does a great job of playing it this way Paul Scofield has lamentably too small a part as the ghost of the dead king Helena Bonham Carter came alive as Ophelia descends into madness but unfortunately played the character as so thoroughly dull as dishwater earlier in the film that I was almost note almost unable to feel much for the character later I think though that Zeffirelli purposely had her play it that way to contrast with the later madness Zeffirelli s direction was pretty straightforward for the most part so much so that when he occasionally threw in a trick it seemed totally out of place The more obvious examples were the circular tracking shot around Hamlet and Ophelia during their meeting in the hall when he dumps her and the exterior shots of her leading up to her drowning made me feel like I was watching a Swedish art film I was almost expecting the camera to pull back and reveal Death standing there in black cloak right out of THE SEVENTH SEAL Still he did a good job of opening up the play from the confines of stage sets I m not a purist so a lot of the cuts didn t bother me overmuch other than my occasionally reacting Waitaminute isn t there supposed to be a scene with so and so here And I was a bit thrown when the entire first scene of the play was missing as contrasted to ROMEO AND JULIET which starts out exactly as the play The only part that really threw me was hearing Hamlet s Get thee to a nunnery speech during the play within a play scene I d thought that it came in the scene where he dumps Ophelia and flipping through the play after I got home I saw that I was correct But the cut and paste aspects of the screenplay will most likely affect only the purist Overall HAMLET is worth seeing but don t expect to be overawed
0914,Spoorloos,1988,Have you ever gone to a public place like a shopping centre or a pool or a petrol station and lost track of your friend sibling wife husband child Have they then inexplicably failed to show up at a pre arranged meeting place leaving you to torture yourself with horrible thoughts about what might have happened to them This is the topic of the newly released Dutch film THE VANISHING This is no horror movie and yet it can be very scary it evokes that mildly terrifying experience of loss and panic that most of us have had Although it s a Dutch movie most of the dialogue is in French and almost all of the action is set in France It s about a young Dutch couple who drive to France for their summer holiday as young Dutch couples tend to do They stop at a petrol station and red headed Saskia goes inside to buy a Coke and a Beer She never returns Her husband Rolf freaks out but is unable to locate her and eventually has to return to Holland For three years he runs a desperate poster campaign to locate her Then well I don t want to spoil it for you Suffice to say that the plot takes a devious turn and the movie climaxes in one of the most surprising and emotional endings I have ever seen And most distressing of all it s 100 believable SEE THIS MOVIE and if anyone tries to tell you the ending KILL THEM It s currently showing in Brisbane I don t know about any other cities
0915,Once Around,1991,Capsule review Boston Italian family has its problems when their daughter brings home as a lover a flashy boorish salesman Salesman overpowers the family and tests the strength of relationships Comedy drama has more to it than it may at first seem Rating 2 4 to 4 The Bellas are a closely knit Italian family living near Boston They have little oddities but they accept each other and as a family they work Then Renata played by Holly Hunter breaks up with her boyfriend and decides she wants to sell condos for a living She goes to a sales class in St Martin and brings back a lover Sam played by Richard Dreyfus is an over ripe salesman with a phenomenal sales record and some odd Lithuanian ways Sam is welcomed into the family with a big smile that wilts when he is not looking He simply does not fit it He upstages family members with extravangances and he overpowers family events with the subtlety of sales pep rallies As time passes the pressures increase until the family is seriously in danger of splitting up Is Sam a genuinely destructive force or is the real problem in the family s unwillingness to accept a newcomer who is do different from themselves ONCE AROUND is directed by Lasse Hallstrom the Swede who directed MY LIFE AS A DOG Like Louis Malle Hallstrom has insights into American life that an American director might miss By the same token however he misses details such as the inappropriateness of Hunter s accent She is the main character and she could have really used an accent coach Dreyfus is however well cast if not too much differently from his role in TIN MEN and even THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ The casting of Laura San Giacomo and Gena Rowlands as Renata s sister and mother are both fine Especially good is Danny Aiello as Renata s father Joe Much of the friction that makes the story is between the Dreyfus character and the Aiello character Joe Bella goes through a lot of changes in the course of the film and Aiello is a joy to watch Also notable is co producer Griffin Dunne as Renata s boyfriend Hallstrom has a good eye for the small dramatic incidents of life and also the daily ironies While the film is largely about Sam s idiosyncrasies it takes at least one meaning of its title ONCE AROUND from a strange custom of Joe Bella on important family occasions he traditionally drives around a traffic rotary But for a little heavy handed melodrama toward the end this is a nice comedy drama worth seeing I give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0916,Alice,1990,Every year just as winter peaks and begins to peter out into a sloppy mess Woody Allen redeems this most cheerless of seasons with a new movie This year he gives us ALICE which stars Mia Farrow and in which Allen himself does not appear But of course Allen need hardly appear physically in a Woody Allen film for his presence to dominate and inform every scene His major presence in ALICE is that Mia Farrow has begun to speak her lines exactly as Allen does even to the point where it becomes somewhat distracting The title character played brilliantly by Farrow is a modern upper crust neurosis ridden Manhattanite interpretation of the Lewis Carrol Alice Farrow s Alice takes Chinese herbs with a lot more various effects that the old one side makes you taller routine of the Caterpillar The herbalist acupuncturist is played by Keye Luke who long ago and in a different world was I believe No 1 Son in the the Charlie Chan series Everywhere Alice goes there are looking glasses in background This Alice is an innocent on the cusp of discovering herself Her husband is a cold patronizing and treacherous William Hurt Her lover is Joe Mantegna Mantegna s performance is particularly good being the only actor in the movie who has chance of stealing the lead from Farrow Julie Kavner Bernadette Peters and Cybil Shepherd have minor roles the wealth of Allen is staggering if he can afford to underuse such major character actors as Kavner who is also appearing AWAKENINGS currently and Peters who has never had a good movie but for whom hope springs eternal Gwen Verdon who was the fabulous dancer singer who starred as Lola in DAMN YANKEES long time passing remember Whatever Lola Wants Lola Gets and Little Man Lola Wants You appears as Alice s mother who had a short career in the movies before she drank herself to death with Margaritas But darling you know I never could resist anything with salt on the rim Allen by the way does us all a major service when he finds and uses some otherwise nearly forgotten of star of other years In NEW YORK STORIES the woman who played his mother was the original voice of Betty Boop for example I read this last week a description of Hurt grabbing Mantegna and dancing around in a circle yelling We re going to do a Woody we re going to do a Woody Too much praise for Farrow s accomplishment is not possible She brings a guileless honesty to her role a deadpan serious to the hijinks and fantasy that makes them all the more delightful In many ways ALICE marks Farrow s emergence as a major film actor Another reliable feature of Allen films is the music Allen is well known to be a major major jazz aficionado who like Mantegna s character Joe plays the sax and who has a record collection that is reliably described as fantastic The sound track of ALICE features some well chosen selections from such a collection including Alice Blue Gown and that one about Old Chinatown Unfortunately I do not think the movie per se is as good as its performers The fantasy elements are handled well but my own class prejudices are such that I have trouble being too sympathetic toward upper class angst My prejudices aside the ending of the film is horribly disfiguringly hurried and left me with a very unsatisfied feeling Briefly I have to say that ALICE is major Farrow but minor Allen But then as others have remarked a second rate Allen movie is better than just about anyone else s first rate movie
0917,Alice,1990,Woody Allen s work is getting spotty these days It was once true that an Allen film could be depended on to be worth seeing He cannot be faulted for a CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and at least HANNAH AND HER SISTERS was a popular success but every once in a while one of his films goes really wrong It is hard to imagine Allen thought he could make anything great out of the material in A MIDSUMMER SEX COMEDY It was surprising the film was at all watchable But BROADWAY DANNY ROSE left one feeling more could have been done with the material And that feeling is a lot stronger with ALICE This is a film that has an intriguing concept and a terrific cast yet ends up as dry and uninteresting as its title The title character is played by Mia Farrow Farrow s performances are an acquired taste but to the best of my knowledge Woody Allen is the only one who has ever acquired it Alice is the air headed wife of a very successful executive when she is given magical means to examine her life the lives of her friends and her relationship with her family What she discovers is that she does not like her husband for good reason She does like her sister with whom she has had a difficult relationship She sort of likes a man to whom she has been attracted played by Joe Mantegna Eventually her life comes together in a hokey and stereotyped way And how does she get the means to examine her life She has back pain and goes to a mysterious doctor in Chinatown played by Keye Luke who incidentally died of a stroke on January 12 Dr Yang treats her with opium and magic herbs that give her the power to see ghosts or become invisible or change her personality In spite of the fact that Yang is benevolent this is all Fu Manchu stuff and Allen should be ashamed to write it into a film There are of course a few good lines in the script to remind us that Allen could be writing good comedy if that was what he wanted to do It is hard to find a good role for Bernadette Peters but she does have a very good comic scene in this film And a single scene is all that many of the name actors got in this effort Cameo actors include Gwen Verdon Cybill Shepherd Julie Kavner Patrick O Neal and Bob Balaban Alec Baldwin has a small role as a ghost who is usually seen in shadows And there are a lot of shadows in this dark film dark in color and often in tone I rate this one a disappointing low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale
0918,Cyrano de Bergerac,1990,The French language film CYRANO DE BERGERAC stars France s most popular actor Gerard Depardieu It is a handsome affecting version of this nineteenth century warhorse a verse play by Edmund Rostand Americans mostly I assume know Cyrano through the interpretations of Jose Ferrer also called CYRANO DE BERGERAC and Steve Martin ROXANNE Martin s pastiche of the source material is a pretty good vehicle for him but not necessarily for the story or for his Cyrano esque character but especially not for his Roxanne played most ineptly by Daryl Hannah Jose Ferrer s 1950s film on the other extreme is extremely stagy in its concept and execution which is to say it looks and sounds like a filmed stage play and Ferrer s delivery is smooth polished Shakespearean and fluid a gentleman s Cyrano The best quality that Depardieu brings to Cyrano is his roughness his lack of smoothness polish and Shakespearean or Comedie Francaise delivery Depardieu reminds us that Cyrano despite his aristocratic lineage is a Gascon practically a foreigner in Seventeenth Century Paris impecunious a poet and a soldier His Cyrano has more in common with the pit than with the precieux in the boxes or sitting on the stage itself This Cyrano is a populist rogue a thief and a roughneck a very angry man who makes us understand why he is so ready to fight In fact Depardieu s impassioned angry noble and principled Cyrano reminded me most of that wonderful poet and scalawag Francois Villon whose best known poem is probably the ballade in Le Testament with the refrain Mais ou son les neiges d antan or Where are the snows of yesterday CYRANO is filled with wonderful scenes of great detail texture and brilliance The opening sequence takes us into a primitive theater and down into the pit a place so abandoned to its own chaos that bears would blush to be seen there It is there we first meet Cyrano who causes a glorious uproar that results in a duel with a precieu a kind of literary dandy of the day During the duel Cyrano promises to extemporize a ballade and to finish his opponent with the last couplet I have not seen a costume flick that so evoked the nitty gritty of early modern life since THE THREE FOUR MUSKETEERS movies of Richard Lester This Paris not only glitters it stinks War is not only brave charges it s slowly starving to death in siege it s dying in a suicide charge ordered by a supercilious and vengeful officer The production values and the research behind them alone recommend the movie I regret I am not sufficiently familiar with the French cinema to know any of the actors in CYRANO except for Depardieu I can tell you Depardieu has not been better since LA RETOUR DE MARTIN GUERRE and that his performance totally redeems his reputation from an extremely objectionable and hateful movie he appeared in four or so years ago which I think was released in this country as MENAGE A TROIS I can praise the actor who played Roxanne but I cannot tell you her name alas As is the often the case in the best French movies this one is densely populated with wonderful character actors all of whom are worthy of praise but who will remain anonymous masters of their craft for this poster And now a word about the subtitles They are a verse translation by the English writer Anthony Burgess A CLOCKWORK ORANGE ENDERBY etc At first when a rhymed couplet appeared on the bottom of the screen I was a little distracted But I quickly acclimated and forgot about them CYRANO is a wordy play and movie scenes consist of wonderful speeches more than action The subtitles are in fact admirably succinct and easily encompassed without losing sight of the screen area above them This CYRANO works hard at not being a filmed play The result is sumptuous detailed and lively camera work
0919,Green Card,1990,Peter Weir last seen directing DEAD POETS SOCIETY brings together Gerard Depardieu probably the most popular actor in France and Andie MacDowell from SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE in this Australian French co production It is set in New York and is essentially a love story Depardieu plays George who manages to stay legally in the U S and obtain a green card by a convenience marriage to Bronte MacDowell They part after the marriage but some time later have to spend some days together to learn about each other because the INS Immigration and Naturalization Service is checking up on them Naturally they start off disliking each other because they are so different The rest is fairly obvious and despite the predictable and unoriginal story a delight to watch The film has a light and relaxed touch aided immeasurably by Depardieu s lightness of acting especially body language despite his bulk You find yourself being carried along with a smile on your face as the two principal characters argue reveal their pasts and foibles and begin to fall in love The music is terrific which is a mixture of classical particularly the well suited Mozart and modern electronic new age At one point when George and Bronte are in their separate beds but thinking of each other the original music by Hans Zimmer is almost entirely responsible for the emotional charge of the scene Indeed music plays an important role in the story culminating in George s dilemma at showing off non existent composing skills at a party which is brilliantly solved The dialogue is okay and minor characters are underwritten both typical Weir problems The scenes with Bronte s father and George in particular seem unfinished Overall a very enjoyable film I strongly recommend GREEN CARD
0920,Eve of Destruction,1991,EVE OF DESTRUCTION is the sort of science fiction film that nobody minds if you call sci fi It is an action film with a poorly thought out science fiction premise that happens on a few nice ideas but generally wastes them It seems that missiles are not a very subtle way to place a nuclear bomb Instead the government is going to use a robot who short of surgery cannot be distinguished from an attractive blonde Inside the robot s chest is a nuclear bomb about the size of a soup can Inside the robot s head are many of its inventor s memories experiences and attitudes In front of this head is the inventor s face The inventor is Dr Eve Simmons and the robot s name is Eve VIII So the robot really is the Eve of Destruction get it Baghdad would know something was up if we shot a nuclear missile at them I guess but would never notice anything strange if a tall leggy blond walked into town Eve VIII is being tested with full nuclear capability in real world situations such as going to the bank Suddenly she runs into the unexpected her temporary controller is killed and she starts running lose in the real world like a female Terminator She is following instructions programmed into her head but also enjoying new found toys such as Uzi machine guns Anti terrorist Jim McQuade played by Gregory Hines and Eve Simmons played by Renee Soutendijk must team up to out fight and out think the robot Nice things could still be done with this idea but nothing really interesting comes out of it A little if made of the idea that the woman and the robot will have some of the same thoughts but mostly it is a contrivance to make the needle a little easier to find in the haystack and at the same time to make it a little more dangerous Eve VIII takes particular exception to being called bitch and always uses it as a trigger to go violent The audience knows that via repetitions but Dr Simmons shows no sign of knowing it And when late in the film McQuade seems to know the trigger we can only conclude that he learned it reading the script The robot is made of some material that is not greatly damaged in a seventy mile per hour impact but still feels real in a slow breast fondle That s the material rocket scientists have been looking for for years There is occasionally a little fun here but overall the film is mostly for a drive in style audience I rate it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0921,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,Starring Jodie Foster Anthony Hopkins Scott Glenn Ted Levine et al directed by Jonathan Demme I had the great pleasure of attending a sneak preview of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS here in Boston last night courtesy of Premiere magazine and let me not mince words it s one of the best horror suspense movies I ve ever seen and you should go see it the moment it opens Period For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the novel by Thomas Harris on which the film is based the plot centers around the search for a serial killer called Buffalo Bill who has been leaving a trail of partially flayed women s bodies The FBI Behavioral Science Unit is on the case and is hoping to enlist the aid of another serial killer currently in custody the brilliant psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter the old Set a thief to catch a thief tactic Clarice Starling an FBI trainee is assigned to talk to him and they develop an eerie sort of partnership in which he trades his insights on Buffalo Bill for glimpses into Clarice s soul I went into this movie with very high expectations having read the book several times and it is one hell of a good one along with many others dealing with serial killer syndrome factual and fictional And I must say that even though I knew what was going to happen and how everything would end Demme s treatment was thoroughly gripping suspenseful and scary There are some scenes that are rather disturbing albeit not terribly graphic in the sense of large amounts of blood spraying around the room just grim and gritty There are some alterations to the story but not really material ones generally it s quite faithful to the novel and hangs together very well One moment in the search that seems like a complete anticlimax proves to be anything but that and Demme engineers it so skillfully that you don t know for sure until the very last instant I don t want to give away any more about this bit though The performances are uniformly fine Jodie Foster gives us a character who is ambitious smart and strong but is still working to gain mastery of herself and to keep it in the company of a spiritual vampire like Lecter I was a bit leery of Anthony Hopkins as Lecter having seen Brian Cox s portrayal in MANHUNTER based on Harris s previous novel RED DRAGON but he doesn t disappoint at all His version of Lecter captures very well the creepy elegance of a brilliant but utterly twisted mind that thrives on reaching into other people s souls and finding where they hurt There are a couple of places in the script where he lapses into cruelty laced with a crudeness that was a little jarring for me as this isn t quite in keeping with Harris s portrayal of the character but these weren t seriously detrimental The scenes between him and Starling are full of tension psychological sparring carried on through the glass or barred walls of Lecter s cages the places where he is imprisoned are very medieval looking and while he sits quietly inside Starling paces and prowls on the outside looking for a way in it s all very engrossing I guess my only real complaint about the film would be that we don t get to see as much of Jame sic Gumb the man who is Buffalo Bill as I would have wished Part of the fascination of serial killers is learning what the private fantasy is that makes them do what they do in the particular way they do it we don t get to see very much of Jame Gumb s world although the glimpses we get are tantalizing and spooky And I was a little bit annoyed that the last words he speaks in the book are omitted here as they have the effect to my mind at least of forming another of these weird bonds between killer and captor But this is a minor cavil To summarize this is a generally faithful and thoroughly effective treatment of an excellent novel and sure to please anyone who appreciates suspense psychological drama and the type of horror that can only come from the real world And by the way there are also some laughs in it humor as black as you would expect under the circumstances Don t miss it
0922,Sleeping with the Enemy,1991,Thanks to 20th Century Fox I had the chance to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY before its release It stars Julia Roberts as a young housewife who is married to a man who both physically and emotionally abuses her In order to escape during a small trip out to sail she fakes her own drowning and then proceeds to change her entire appearance and identity She then moves to Iowa where she becomes involved with another man who is not totally oblivious to the mysterious manner about her Her husband eventually gets indications that she is still alive and proceeds to track her down This film is expertly executed with all the necessary doom impending camera angles and dim lights and if one has seen a lot of thrillers SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY could be considered run of the mill One recent thriller this film may be compared to is PACIFIC HEIGHTS which although having a different plot outline has the same basic thrills My attempt here is not to belittle this film in my opinion in most respects it is better than PACIFIC HEIGHTS one respect for example is the thriller lover s favorite how they get rid of the baddie at the end It is a well planned and an altogether convincing film that one should not miss if on likes a good thriller Julia Roberts delivers a admirable performance as the tortured wife of this man she so desperately wants to get away from Joseph Ruben as a director effectively manages to contribute something if not the same type of thrills over again to the thriller genre although in my opinion this was not a great contribution Don t get me wrong all in all as far as thrillers go this one is good If there is anyone out there who goes to the movies to latch on to some character to hate then this movie is definitely for them It manages to show how the good intentions of some people manages to further the bad intentions of other people In layman s terms I would consider this movie to be a popcorn crunching movies if you buy a bag before the show I assure you it will be gone by the end

Story,1991,In STARDUST MEMORIES the aliens tell Woody Allen We like your films especially the earlier funnier ones It is a running gag Everybody in STARDUST MEMORIES likes Allen s earlier funnier films Actually even outside of STARDUST MEMORIES people seem to prefer Allen s earlier style but Allen does not want to go back to it That makes it fair game for other filmmakers With L A STORY Steve Martin is filling that void picking up the earl Allen style We have a film with a slight plot which is really mostly an excuse to tie together small skits jokes and sight gags about life in Los Angeles Martin who scripted is every bit as loving of his Los Angeles in spite of its faults as Woody Allen is of New York City and speaking as someone living in the New York area with just as much reason Martin plays Harris Telemacher who in spite of his Ph D is a sort of television clown weather man He breaks up with his mistress who is selfish and uninteresting and begins dating a 23 year old nymphette but he really wants to win a British journalist played by Victoria Tennant who is in town to write an elitist snobby put down article about Los Angeles Unfortunately she finds both the town and its goofy weather man entirely charming each in spite of its little quirks But Harris has problems deciding what he really wants romantically and going for it Then from the most unexpected source a mystical force takes control of Harris s life and pushes it in the right direction While the style is archeo Allen the plot is really neo Allen and there is more than a little similarity between the plot of L A STORY and a film like PLAY IT AGAIN SAM or even the current ALICE But L A STORY s attraction is not so much plot as sidebar humor Martin takes affectionate swipes at traffic congestion earthquakes the superficiality of the people crime and a lot more Here and there Martin swipes a scene from some well known source Knowing some very basic French and Spanish will be of some assistance too Steve Martin deserves additional credit for letting someone else Mick Johnson direct L A STORY All too often when the star of a film writes the screenplay he feels he should direct also Many good actors have a very hard time directing themselves though they do not realize how hard a time they had until the film is released Gene Wilder is one actor who cannot direct himself for example By letting someone else direct Martin can concentrate on his performance And his performance is fine in this slight but funny comedy I rate it a high 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0924,Popcorn,1991,Good horror films are few and far between but good horror film spoofs are so rare as to be an endangered species POPCORN is sadly not such a rare breed if RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD or NIGHT OF THE CREEPS are California condors POPCORN is more like a New York pigeon it s a film that s messy unavoidable and not too bright On the other hand who could argue with the film s tag line which is easily the cleverest thing about it For weeks before it opened advertisements were plastered throughout the New York City subway system in every major newspaper on television and even in participating video stores which only goes to show that the producers know where lies their largest audience For weeks we read the fruits of some anonymous advertising exec s late night brainstorm Buy a bag go home in a box Chilling no Well no The film s poster is nicely designed and features a skull hiding behind the mask of a young girl s face While this has as little to do with the film as does the tag line it does make for an aesthetically pleasing poster and given the state of the New York City subways the Phantom would never argue against a pleasant looking though terribly misleading movie poster The film itself features neither skulls nor bags and the only box in POPCORN is the one the writers get themselves into fairly early on Happily though there is in fact some popcorn in the film albeit less than there was on the theater floor during the Phantom s showing What there isn t is even a half dozen suspenseful scenes two or three credible characters acting at a level above a high school Our Town production or a remotely believable plot Taken at face value POPCORN is not exactly food for the hungry horror phan though if one ignores the misleading advertising and takes it as what the Phantom will bet it was intended as a relatively harmless and exceedingly mild spoof of all the corny 1950s horror films we so loved on Saturday afternoons and late Sunday nights on Chiller Theater it s just barely enough to tide you over until heartier fare is served It took a while before it occurred to the Phantom that the filmmakers could not possibly have intended us to take POPCORN seriously but that points out one of its worst failings as a horror parody for a film that was intended to satirize recent and not so recent horror films it s neither outrageously funny ridiculously gory laughingly scripted nor paced and acted as if Edward D Wood Jr father of the classic PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE were directing from beyond the grave Most of the time POPCORN just sits there like the unpopped bottom of the bag kind of film it is going through the all too familiar paces of a half baked horror sendup By the time the film was half over the Phantom had thoughts of some of POPCORN s brothers in horror parody failure STUDENT BODIES SATURDAY THE 14TH TRANSYLVANIA 6 5000 And his thoughts were these I wonder if I should leave now and get an early start on my tax return Sadly the Phantom s taxes remain unpaid and as the evening wore on his dreams for a satisfying horror film went unfulfilled The plot such as it is is held together with what turns out to be yet another spoof though alas not a very successful one While an audience is assembled to watch a horror thon a vengeful psychopath takes his revenge as vengeful psychopaths often do on the members of the film school class who are running the show These poor folks need to raise money to continue their brave efforts at independent filmmaking or perhaps to exhume Mr Wood to direct POPCORN II the Phantom wasn t quite clear on this point his thoughts having begun their inexorable drift to the ides of April even at that early stage Nonetheless the resourceful auteurs to be shortly set to work at the horror film spoof equivalent of fixing up the old barn to put on a show renovating a local theater palace and preparing to put on a triple bill of old horror and science fiction duds from the fifties evidently expecting people to pay 10 to see ancient classics presented complete with their original in theater special effects including the miracle of 3 D the miracle of Shock O Vision and the miracle of Smell O Vision As the Phantom himself had just paid 7 50 plus 2 for soda to see POPCORN in the miracle of Soon To Be On Cable Vision he wasn t at all surprised to see the auditorium soon fill to capacity with lovers of schlock cinema Naturally once the shows begin the poor film students start getting dispatched in ways that mirror more or less the action on the screen Curiously the action on their screen is much more enjoyable and much better done than is the action on ours POPCORN succeeds to some small degree in satirizing hoary old shockers like TARANTULA it does less well with a parody of a random Incredible Blah Blah Blah Man flick and by the time the film arrives at The Stench yes that s the name not the review folks the Phantom wasn t quite sure what on Earth was being sent up But the film itself is only interesting during those brief voyeuristic periods when we re watching what everyone in the film is watching Once their and our attention returns to the action in the theater itself it s time to start contemplating our withholding statements again But what if the inept action off screen was also intended to be a parody By the time he d begun to consider whether he was making a sufficiently large contribution to his IRA it dawned on the Phantom that the filmmakers surely could not have meant anyone to take any of the film seriously unlike say DAWN OF THE DEAD or AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON POPCORN was not supposed to be a horror film with elements of parody Instead they must have intended the film itself to be a spoof This put things in a different light though sadly not in a more favorable one for it turns out that POPCORN spends most of its time attempting unsuccessfully to parody the worst cliches from some of the worst of the early eighties slash and trash horror films In case you managed to avoid the great tidal waves of FRIDAY THE 13TH clones and knockoffs that washed up on the shores of the horror cinema a decade ago stop by your local Blockbusters and rent the absolute nadir of the genre HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME This is the sort of film where stupid adolescents are killed with metronome like regularity in highly unique and improbable ways by an all too obvious killer who without fail turns out to be yet another slighted adolescent who decides to do in the entire senior class because he couldn t get a date for the prom It s the sort of film in which the sheer number and kinds of killings were advertised as pretty much the only reason to see it after all where else could you see teenagers killed with fireplace pokers and dumb bells and spatulas and tuning forks and the like Best of all it was named after a holiday which as everyone who s been a horror phan since HALLOWEEN knows is a sure way to make a few extra bucks at the box office We missed GROUND HOG S DAY THE SHADOW S REVENGE but we got GRADUATION DAY MY BLOODY VALENTINE NEW YEAR S EVIL SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT and on and on We even got THE DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN surely one of the most cynically titled films of all time though BEYOND THE FOG a film that had as little to do with THE FOG as THE DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN had to do with HALLOWEEN runs a close second Such films should be simple to parody after all their premises are so predictable their surprises are so unsurprising and their acting and dialog are so awful but although POPCORN comes close at times it really never has its heart in it it never really lets loose and becomes a classic like NIGHT OF THE CREEPS EVIL DEAD 2 REANIMATOR or RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD Instead it s a parody done with the straightest of faces one that fritters away its entire first half setting up a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET like plot just to discard it and head for the ridiculous in the last third of the film POPCORN feels a lot like a film that was designed by a committee or perhaps a film started by one person and finished by someone else Regardless it winds up as an abject failure of a horror film and a big disappointment of a horror film parody It s a shame really because POPCORN does have some intentionally or so the Phantom assumes hilarious moments and the whole premise of the film did manage to get the Phantom s mind off his 1040 every so often It might work better perhaps for those phans who can remember seeing horror films in the fifties and sixties back before the advent of Cinema 1 2 3 N and video when in theater special effects were the rage and just going to a movie at all was a special event The Phantom himself indulged in some mock nostalgia since although he s too young to remember those days he does have a great fondness for the Rialtos and Bijous of days gone by But alas there is little more than that to recommend POPCORN Although this is the first horror film parody or not to be released in a couple of months it s no longer the only one out there as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will be in general release in a matter of days At best POPCORN is the very definition of a wait for video horror film and then only if all the copies of MISERY have already been rented Horror film parodies are indeed hard to find and if the Phantom s review has piqued your curiousity you might want to give EVIL DEAD 2 a try though you should see the first one first if only so you ll know what s being parodied RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD directed by Dan O Bannon does a fine job of sending up George Romero s horror classic when shooting a zombie in the head fails to stop it one character even says But it worked in the movie and in it s own strange way CHILD S PLAY still stands as one of the best slash and trash parodies ever made in addition to being a great horror film in its own right The 7 50 you ll save by avoiding POPCORN will more than cover the rental fees for all three of these films and you ll surely be able to keep your mind off your taxes longer than the Phantom was able to Given that POPCORN will probably appear on video around the middle of April this seems particularly appropriate
0925,Mr. & Mrs. Bridge,1990,The following musings are not really a review of the movie Mr AND MRS BRIDGE but are well musings I have not included any spoiler warnings because the movie does not really have any surprises MR AND MRS BRIDGE is one of the most depressing movies I ve seen in a long time Why you ask Because it s about my family And I ll bet it s about a lot of your families too Granted my family was not nearly as wealthy as the Bridges I d classify us as comfortably middle class but my mom suffered from the same slow nullification of her personhood as Mrs Bridge How many of us had mom s who were raised to believe that the most noble aspiration a woman could have was to dedicate her life to her husband and kids How many of our moms ended up lost and completely insecure when we became teenagers and didn t want her around all the time anymore and dad was too busy with his career to give her a sense of importance MR AND MRS BRIDGE is a most damning view of the traditional family unit and the devastation it has on the women who have given up all their dreams and talents to serve a family that after a while doesn t even seem to need them anymore Are they supposed to get fulfillment from silly painting classes and endless games of bridge hmmm hadn t noticed that connection to the movie before By keeping their wives completely buffered and protected from everything outside the home the husbands functionally and emotionally disable their wives to the point where they don t even have their own opinions As depressing at it was I liked MR AND MRS BRIDGE precisely because I hated PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED Were we really supposed to believe that Peggy Sue could give up all her hopes and dreams and get fulfillment solely from her kids and husband I think not I think MR AND MRS BRIDGE is a sequel to PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED showing us what really happened to Peggy Sue several years later I applaud MR AND MRS BRIDGE for challenging our comfortable image of how right the traditional family unit is and for pointing out how many people women have given up their entire lives for a myth
0926,Betsys Wedding,1990,Alan Alda makes very irritating movies They are never 100 bad but they are always inconsistent with good performances hidden by poor performances boring writing intercut with wry observations on life and clumsy direction Of his movies I liked SWEET LIBERTY the best though it too suffered from all the things I ve mentioned here BETSY S WEDDING is a very typical Alda movie BETSY S WEDDING follows the few months between the time Betsy Molly Ringwald announces her engagement and marries a young man from a very rich family Every pre wedding cliche in the book is played out in the interim Rich fiance s family tries to take over but Betsy s Dad Alan Alda insists that he ll handle everything Both Ringwald and Alda are incredibly dull in this movie as is her fiance He s so dull I can neither remember the name of the character he played nor the name of the actor himself Many of the supporting characters give wonderful performance Madeline Kahn as Betsy s Mom and as Steve Vidi the the sweet natured hood particularly stand out Joe Pesci gives his patented hyper performance as Betsy s uncle The subplots dealing with the underworld and Steve s devotion to Betsy s cop sister Ally Sheedy were both more fun than the main plot This is probably worth watching when it hits cable for a few hours of mindless entertainment It s about a 6 on the Chuck scale This movie is rated R probably just because of some sex talk HAMLET was much more graphic and was rated PG 13
0927,Sarah Plain and Tall,1991,This is a made for television movie but deserves notice for its excellent writing and performances You ve probably missed it this time around but it will be shown again and again I m sure My first response was to consider the stars It stars Glenn Close in a sympathetic role something she badly needs She has not played along with her charming natural beauty since THE BIG CHILL Since then she has played against type in FATAL ATTRACTION HAMLET and DANGEROUS LIAISONS Clearly she is determined to avoid being trapped into performing only one type of character And in SARAH PLAIN AND TALL she is perfectly believable as a simple honest and good woman Her co star s name slips my mind which is significant since he is one of my favourites from a few years back who has not appeared in a hit show recently He was the star of DEAD ZONE is it Christopher Walken yes Moderator and THE DEER HUNTER and was very memorable in NEXT STOP GREENWICH VILLAGE He has perhaps been the victim of typecasting as an intellectual He has always played delicate rather effete characters but in SARAH PLAIN AND TALL he is extremely effective and believable as a simple man who makes his living with the strength of his body not his mind Watching this movie I quickly came to believe totally in the characters and to care about their situation By the end I found that I could not go back to regular modern shows They seemed too plastic and shallow I was completely gone into Sarah s world The movie is based on a book and perhaps it is a true story It feels true The feelings are very and real and gentle It is similar to WITNESS but without the contrived cop drama element The concern is with family home and work not big city crime and murder If you are looking for something different something more realistic and also more delicate than most dramas catch SARAH PLAIN AND TALL
0931,Once Around,1991,Capsule review A well done movie about relationships and fitting in A movie that makes you think about relationships love life death family change and just about every other human emotion Rating 2 4 to 4 worth the full price to see Richard Dreyfus and Holly Hunter reunite again as lovers Their last meeting was in the 1989 hit ALWAYS These two have a chemistry between them that lets us get carried up in their love for each other These two are fun to watch together Dreyfus always seems to be running around out of control while Hunter in contrast seems to be calm and in control of her life We never doubt their feelings for each other Sam Sharpe Richard Dreyfus plays a successful condo salesman who never really fits into the Bella family Although he tries he never grasps when to leave well enough alone Dreyfus as the stereotypical salesman interacts so well with everyone in the cast everyone is effected by him Whether positively or negatively he does effect everyone in the movie As the family s feelings toward Sam changed my feelings changed with them Is this the director conveying these feelings to me or is it Dreyfus I think that it s Dreyfus as an actor And what is it about Holly Hunter that is so appealing Hunter is so captivating that one wants to jump up into the movie and hug her Hunter plays Renata Bella the youngest daughter to Joe Danny Aiello and I cannot remember her first name Gena Rowlands Bella Renata s life is in a state of disarray when we meet her She s looking for a career and her longtime lover fails to commit to her We cannot but help to feel sorry for her The action between Joe and Sam is what makes this movie funny Two strong willed men fighting for control of the family and ultimately Renata The friction between them is fueled by the fact that both men are both very eccentric Each has their strange and sometimes humorous ethnic customs that they strictly follow even when circumstances do not permit the continuance of the outdated custom In fact the funniest parts of this film are the two men acting out their customs and the others ability to deal with the annoyance The satisfying part of the movie is we get to see everyone change After all it is change that is the only constant in life we d better deal with it somehow Although the Bella family is slow and somewhat reluctant to change the strength of the family unity is tested and ultimately strong enough to withstand the highly eccentric Sam Ironically it is Sam who does the least amount of changing A strong theme throughout this movie more strongly in the beginning than in the end is that you can never return home Renata returns home after she breaks up with her first lover The problems begin when she brings Sam home I always liked Sam after all he is trying to please everybody he doesn t have a bad bone in his body I had a problem with the Bella s hesitation to accept Sam and Renata s happiness The movie did seem to drag on for a while in the middle probably because of lack of a plot Overall I enjoyed the movie and I would probably see it again I couldn t help but compare Joe and Sam to Archie Bunker and Mike in All in the Family On many levels Joe and Archie are very similar they both have eccentric habits and are reluctant to accept their daughter s lover Sam and Mike keep on living uneffected by their father in law s actions and they don t seem to care what is thought about them Joe is no Archie Bunker though in the end Joe realizes his daughter s happiness and accepts Sam for who he is
0932,L.A. Story,1991,This one took me by surprise none of the ads clips or reviews I saw prepared me for this good a movie It s an intelligent funny romantic comedy using Los Angeles as a surreal backdrop Written by and starring Steve Martin it s the story of a wiggy wacky TV weatherman who gets dumped by his status conscious girlfriend Marilu Henner has a brief affair with a frenetic valley girl named SanDeE no that s not my terminal acting up and ultimately pursues a British journalist played by Martin s real life wife Victoria Tennant But this is L A and the city is as much a character in this story as anyone else Indeed a central character is a freeway road conditions sign that magically communicates with Martin and helps him in his romantic quests One reviewer compared this movie s fairy tale aspects to those of ALICE but with a lighter touch As is expected from Martin L A is the butt of a continual string of jokes and the film is filled with jabs at the people and lifestyles of southern California Some are mildly amusing Martin driving over sidewalks and neighbors lawns and down steep staircases to avoid traffic jams power lunchers blase ignorance of an earthquake Others are wickedly hilarious the TV station s ever changing news show format Martin s attempts to obtain a reservation at the city s hottest new restaurant L Idiot where potential customers must submit complete financial records and diners are offered designer dental floss between courses Two days later I m still finding myself chuckling over some scenes This is the type of California bashing the rest of the country loves to see But in this case it is all tempered by gorgeous scenes of the tropical the bright the successful side of L A life Martin may complain of living in an intellectual free zone but everybody is enjoying it and we do too There are many visually stunning scenes and liberal use of time lapse photography The mood is capped by lush musical interludes from new age artist Enya With so much going on you have to look fast You ll easily miss some of the visual humor if you don t pay close attention There are also literally dozens of uncredited cameo appearances by well known movie and TV personalities Rick Moranis shows up as a Shakespeare quoting gravedigger Chevy Chase as a restaurant patron whose financial failings relegate him to a table in the back and Patrick Stewart Capt Picard on the new Star Trek as the owner of L Idiot While all the performances are on target it s Steve Martin s writing that impressed me the most All in all thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended
0933,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is Jonathan Demme s adaptation of a novel by Thomas Harris and it knocked my socks off It is a thriller about serial killers one known and in high security detention one unknown and on a bloody rampage The former is played by Anthony Hopkins who has created the creepiest most disturbing villain I have ever seen in a movie He is totally convincing as Hannibal the Cannibal alarming charming and vile intelligent perceptive a human animal If Hopkins doesn t get a best actor nomination next year it will be because the film was released too early in the year although how anyone who sees his performance can ever forget it is beyond me He forms a bizarre alliance with an FBI agent in training played by Jodie Foster Foster turns in an excellent performance that ought to establish her as a creditable adult actor Her performance isn t as flashy as Hopkins but it s thorough and convincing throughout I have only one cavil the other on the loose killer is a gay man Okay there are probably a proportionate number of gay people among killers and psychopaths as in the world at large But I can see no particular reason why this one has to be gay Because he thinks he s a transsexual the film seems to say Hogwash I think the real reason is that a stereotype and a prejudice is being exploited and I say shame on Demme and company One of the things I like about SILENCE is the way the film plays with who are good guys and who are bad guys Hopkins for instance is presented as exactly what he is and yet at the end we like him knowing full well the evil he does Another character who is on the right side of the bars the director of the asylum where Hopkins is kept is clearly marked from the beginning as a villain and we cheer his final fate The other killer Buffalo Bill is presented without any ambiguity all bad but interesting There are consistently good characterizations of the major players all too rare a quality in contemporary scripts In particular we learn a lot about Foster s character even though she is a woman contrary to such movies as THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS and RUSSIA HOUSE Also I was pleased that no one had to fall in love with anyone else although two intriguing friendships develop for Foster The film is ably photographed without particularly drawing attention to itself or making any obvious contribution to the meaning of the film unlike a film such as L A STORY where the camera s love affair with Los Angeles is a substantial part of the film One WARNING this film is a very tense affair with blood violence and mutilation Most of the worst happens out of the range of the camera but enough is shown and the rest talked about so it may disturb some viewers excessively Several people in my audience clearly couldn t take it any more and exited after one particularly grueling scene There is also strong language and some nudity
0934,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,Since 1959 the psychopathic killer has perhaps unfortunately become a staple of popular film Most films that had psychopaths before that point really blurred the distinction between your garden variety murderer and the actual psychopath Perhaps one notable exception was THE BAD SEED which suggested that there could be something like a congenital evil Extreme criminality and madness were very much equated That was very much what was meant with mad scientists of the old horror films There was an urge to deny the existence of evil or to relegate it to the supernatural How many people even today deny the culpability of Adolf Hitler and say instead that he was simply mad There were some films that suggested that there was something more to criminal insanity than just extreme criminality but it was Alfred Hitchcock s PSYCHO that turned the cinematic view around Norman Bates was himself a victim as well as the perpetrator of his acts Bates was a normal person twisted by his past and driven by forces he could not control This is a marvelously egalitarian view of the criminally insane It assumes that all men and women are created equal This is probably an equally invalid view of the criminally insane When John Hurt played Caligula in I CLAUDIUS he described his character as congenitally bonkers In all probability that was fairly accurate It is at least my belief that Caligula was genuinely insane and Hitler was not This view of the pitiful victim psychopath became the dominant view in films with PSYCHO and it has remained dominant With John Carpenter s HALLOWEEN 1978 there was a new view or perhaps an old view harkening back to medieval beliefs that the psychopathic killer is a supernatural force Fortunately few films have picked up on this idea and most that have have large Roman numerals in their titles Thomas Harris has a different concept of the psychopathic killer which if no more credible than the supernatural force s at least more intriguing He created the idea in his novel RED DRAGON which Michael Mann adapted into his 1986 film MANHUNTER The idea was expanded in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which has been adapted into a film by Jonathan Demme Harris s concept is that psychopaths have a distinctly different form of intelligence Their reasoning power is consistent and logical but alien to our own If you cannot bridge the gap and think like a psychopath you are at a distinct disadvantage in dealing with them In addition the psychopath often has superhuman sensory powers For example Harris s Hannibal Lecter in addition to a super intellect apparently has a heightened sense of smell I believe these are ideas that owe their origin more to Poe s Tell Tale Heart than to actual case histories But where Harris is really superb is in being able to make Lecter s reasoning really seem brilliant It is extremely difficult to write a character who is supposed to be brilliant To see how poorly it can be done try going back and listening to Lex Luthor s reasoning about Kryptonite in SUPERMAN 1978 Lecter s reasoning is at once perverted and brilliant MANHUNTER and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are two of what have to be at least four stories involving Hannibal Lecter And they are probably the two least interesting When RED DRAGON begins Lecter has already been captured by Will Graham who made himself into a psychopath in order to catch Lecter in the first place Graham needs Lecter s help to capture another psychopath In THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS fledging FBI agent Clarice Starling no pun intended played by Jodie Foster similarly must enlist Lecter s Anthony Hopkins s help to find a killer This time however Lecter thinks he can work his own deal While this story does conclude there is still a major loose end that really demands yet another story In this story the primary villain is a killer whom the press has dubbed Buffalo Bill The killer not only murders his victims he later skins them Starling is chosen to talk to Dr Lecter about the crimes with an eye toward getting his unique insight into how to capture Buffalo Bill Starling however has her own personal demons inside and Lecter is just the person to turn those demons against her In the book the main story is how Starling catches the killer with the Lecter story being a major subplot The film reverses the importance of the two plots by leaving the Lecter plot intact if not actually expanded and cutting drastically the Buffalo Bill plot The character of Lecter seems calculated to play off every anti intellectual prejudice in the audience The man is an ice cold emotionless intellect He listens to ice cold emotionless music Even when he kills we are told that he is ice cold and emotionless In one chilling detail the character is defined We are told that he attacked and partially ate a victim without his pulse ever going over 80 Stylistically the film is well handled generally At times the music is a bit overly dramatic in underscoring the mood as if Howard Shore the composer did not trust Hopkins s acting to convey a mood of menace If that was the case the composer was misguided since Harris s villain will probably be as memorable as Norman Bates and Michael Meyers The photography uses a filter to subdue the colors If that was not downbeat enough Starling is really the only sympathetic character in the whole story She seems to go from one man to the next who tries to bed her For the sake of completeness at least two nits should be mentioned Starling is first seen climbing a steep hill in the rigorous FBI training school When we see her in close up she is wearing earrings For her own safety at least you would think they would insist on no jewelry Also certain scenes are supposedly seen through an infra red snooperscope and at least one time the subject is in total darkness As seen through the scope even items that do not emit heat are easily seen In the total darkness scene the subject can not only be seen but also to be seen is the subject s sharp shadow on the wall THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is as unpleasant and hypnotic as watching a cobra This is one heavy thriller I give it a high 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0935,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,The Phantom has always wanted to do a TV style two word review suitable for prominent display on a theater marquee So how about SILENCE IS GOLDEN Truly the Phantom feels like Roger Ebert already But in fairness Jonathan Demme s new thriller based on the novel by Thomas Harris is a knockout better even than the Phantom himself had hoped for Good reviews are always the most difficult kind for the Phantom to write it s as difficult to be clever when the Phantom is praising something as it is for him to be fair when he s casting another horrible horror film to the wolves Reviewing a turkey like POPCORN was easy reviewing SILENCE will be much more difficult But let s give it a try starting with the script based on Thomas Harris excellent psychological thriller Harris does psychological thrillers about as well as anyone and in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS he brought back one of his most memorable characters Dr Hannibal Lecter the brilliant but insane psychiatrist who we first met in RED DRAGON which was also turned into a fine though largely overlooked film called MANHUNTER by the talented and stylish director of Miami Vice fame Michael Mann Dr Lecter has the knack of getting inside of people s heads and also the rest of their bodies he wasn t nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for nothing Although Lecter was not the focus of RED DRAGON SILENCE spends most of its time exploring him and his relationship to Clarice Starling a young FBI trainee sent to get Lecter to help an investigation into a series of brutal murders by someone the press has dubbed Buffalo Bill Harris novel spent about as much time with Lecter as it did with Buffalo Bill and in turning it into a film Demme s decision to concentrate on Lecter and relegate the scenes involving Bill to the obligatory final confrontation at the film s end is an inspired one Adapting any novel is difficult if only because it involves reducing what might be a week s worth of entertainment for the average reader to a script which can fit comfortably inside of two hours But it s even more difficult when the novel spends so much time with three very compelling characters Given the need to distill Harris novel down to its essence and yet make SILENCE more than just another run of the mill thriller Demme chooses to use Buffalo Bill more as a convenient excuse than as a character although he doesn t ignore Bill altogether he exists as little more than the subject of Lecter and Starling s conversations and the reason they keep having conversations until quite near the very end of the film Had Demme had lesser actors with which to work or had Harris novel been less literate and more exploitative than it was this decision might well have backfired since it forces a change in tone from exciting manhunt to scenes of static conversation that is risky at best When Michael Mann directed MANHUNTER he chose to make a straightforward adaptation of Harris RED DRAGON In the process he created a gripping scary and effective thriller but at some level it differed little from the hundreds of other thrillers that had come before it In that film an FBI investigator is recalled to help track a serial killer because the FBI knows that he has a knack for thinking like the sociopaths he tracks Harris spent more time on this theme than did Mann and as a consequence MANHUNTER is a much more ordinary thriller than is SILENCE This is not to say that MANHUNTER isn t worth seeing or that it s boring or predictable on the contrary Mann fashioned a supremely enjoyable and stylish film from Harris very good source material But the focus of that film was very much on the hunt although Mann spends some time exploring what it means to be able to think like a serial killer the theme is largely discarded once the film gets going and Mann gets into the heat of the chase Demme however very nearly discards the heat of the chase in favor of what might be called a very warped MY DINNER WITH ANDRE Realizing that in Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins he had two exceptional actors Demme opts to concentrate on their relationship And from the very first meeting it s obvious that he made the right choice Stories involving pretty young investigators and brutal killers are nearly as common in the theaters as they are on television but thrillers that put a camera motionless in a cell and record the conversations between someone as intense as Hannibal Lecter and someone as determined as Clarice Starling are rare to the point of nonexistence It occurred to the Phantom that not since John McNaughton s HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER has a filmmaker had the talent and the courage to assume that his audience wasn t full of drooling PREDATOR 2 fans though the Phantom has yet to meet one he assumes that they must exist somewhere To do what he did Demme had to assume instead that there were real thinking people out there who would find the tension in the scenes between Lecter and Starling as intense and scary as any standard issue killer stalking helpless woman through dark basement scene Of course in the end Demme does hedge his bets a bit but by the time the film changes its focus to Buffalo Bill everyone in the audience feels lucky to have been able to spend some time with Hannibal and Clarice Of course the best script in the world won t help a film if its actors have less range than their guns Fortunately both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give all out performances that are exactly right for what Demme wants to do with the film When the Phantom first read Harris novel he didn t have clear mental pictures of either Clarice Starling or Hannibal Lecter now that he s seen the film however it will be as difficult to picture them as anyone other than Foster and Hopkins as it is to picture anyone other than Alec Guinness as George Smiley when reading John Le Carre s novels Jodie Foster has the toughest job of it which is why her performance is so much more impressive Starling s role throughout the story is very reactive and she spends much of the film providing a foil for Lecter But although much of her character development is excised in the film Foster gives Clarice Starling real substance and she manages to make Starling not just sympathetic but a real person to whom the audience has no trouble relating Anthony Hopkins on the other hand gives a truly brilliant and captivating performance as Hannibal Lecter one that is every bit as good as Jodie Foster s it is as much to his credit as it is to Harris that by the end of the film we feel we know Lecter and maybe even like him a little bit Hopkins stares at Clarice and at us with a hunger and an intensity that s more than a little unsettling As Harris wrote the character Lecter is supposed to be incredibly smart fast and cool and Hopkins Lecter more than lives up to Harris description He always looks to us like a coiled spring or an brilliant and self possessed snake ready to strike at the first opportunity And when Demme gets the camera right up into Hopkins face we see what Clarice sees the slicked back hair the expressionless face the dead and unblinking eyes and we feel what she feels that perhaps the thick bulletproof plastic separating her from Lecter might not be as effective as it first seems From the very first moments of their first meeting Lecter gets both Starling and the audience under his spell and whenever the film returns to Lecter all thoughts of the rest of the plot or even of any other characters melt away as we become completely absorbed in Hopkins performance That however also points out a problem with the film for as much as we would like to linger with Lecter and Starling and learn more about what makes each of them tick Demme must inevitably return to what is after all the film s plot Demme is able to pull off these shifts between Lecter and the investigation using Starling as the link between them until the film s end at which time he becomes a prisoner of the need to resolve everything one way or another As unusual as SILENCE is as a thriller it is ultimately a mass market Hollywood film once all is said and done SILENCE is not another HENRY But the need to return to Buffalo Bill and to provide the film with a satisfactory resolution is but a minor problem and one that we only notice because the film up until that point had been so exceptional In MANHUNTER such resolution seemed perfectly in character since the film is really about a manhunt but in SILENCE the 20 or 30 minutes that Demme needs to force feed us the shaky plot points and fairly incredible coincidences and contrivances necessary to end the film seems like time stolen from the wonderful intriguing and startling Hannibal Lecter and from Anthony Hopkins show stopping performance But that is truly a minor nit to pick On the whole SILENCE succeeds both as an adaptation of a well known and widely read novel and as a film in its own right In fact it s not clear to the Phantom who will enjoy SILENCE more people who have read the novel or people who haven t Although the former may enjoy the last half of the film more than the latter if only because they won t have to rely on the overly rushed explanations and the too brief character sketch of Buffalo Bill they will also be at a disadvantage in knowing what to expect from Dr Lecter People who see the film first will be going in cold and will be able to enjoy both Hopkins and Foster s performances without any preconceived ideas or expectations In any event at the performance the Phantom attended it seemed that none of the seven or eight hundred people in the audience was disappointed with the film and more than a few gave it a round of applause as the credits rolled The Phantom himself looks forward to seeing it again in the coming weeks as much as he enjoyed Harris novel he thinks he enjoyed Hopkins performance even more What more is there to say The film is simply excellent and well worth seeing For phans who haven t yet read Harris novel the Phantom recommends that they first see the film then wait a while and give the novel a try But if you ve already read the novel see the film anyway if only to enjoy the film s beautiful and stylish look Demme s tight and effective direction and of course Foster and Hopkins stellar performances SILENCE is a film to be savored a true rarity an A picture in a B movie genre
0937,NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter The,1990,THE NEVERENDING STORY II is a sequel to the 1985 fantasy based on part of a children s book by Michael Ende that was very popular in Europe but largely unknown in the U S This new installment picks up the story pretty much where the old one left off And although this new movie is different from the earlier it is an open question whether it is better or worse For the record I was disappointed in the first NEVERENDING STORY I didn t like the obvious allegory of the story neither did I think the special effects came up to contemporary standards I did rather like the boy actor who played the central role of hero and I liked the way the story played with the ways the reader enters into and changes the story he or she is reading an idea also exploited to some extent by THE PRINCESS BRIDE In NEVERENDING II I am still bothered by the allegory but while the special effects are pretty obvious they are more interesting and the sets costumes decor and mattes are pretty wonderful However I find I do not much like the new boy actor whose name I do not have in front of me He is not a natural actor but is very visibly reacting and registering Some of the other characters actors seem more capable especially the large bird character that does a lot of fun things with avian body language I also liked the evil witch queen stepmother archetype and her servant Three Faces he of the multiple faces and purposes We meet some familiar characters from the earlier movie including Atreyu the plains Indian warrior boy Rock Biter along with a really charming infant son and that elongated flying Pekinese whose name also escapes me The movie is too much interested in making a point and not enough in telling a story The fantasy exists simply as a frame for the moral rather than having any moral derive from the fantasy Its moral purpose is heavy handed and mercilessly driven home in almost every scene When I think of the most perfect movie of this type THE WIZARD OF OZ and compare it to THE NEVERENDING STORY II I am grateful that the latter is not a musical Despite this adults can take children to this movie in confidence that neither will be neither embarrassed or bored out of their gourds And adults can go by themselves as Lyndol and I did and have a reasonably good time especially at a cheap matinee on a rainy Saturday
0938,Scenes from a Mall,1991,Somebody once told me they thought they could listen to and watch Woody Allen reading white pages out of the phone book and it would be funny His facial expressions are just so funny that anything he does is just naturally hilarious Bette Midler can also be very funny So the question is how long can this couple play a loving and quarreling couple walking around a mall and still carry the film on their innate cuteness Well based on the results in Paul Mazursky s SCENES FROM A MALL the two of them might be able to carry the premise for up to about ten minutes After that they definitely need an assist from a script and the script in SCENES FROM A MALL by Roger Simon and director Mazursky does little to help At least it does little unless you think that everything connected with Beverly Hills is really cute If your idea of a good joke is seeing a line of cars with each driver talking on a cellular phone perhaps you will enjoy this film but I would bet you will find far more on target and funny in L A STORY On their sixteenth wedding anniversary lovey dovey couple Nick played by Woody Allen and Deborah played by Bette Midler go to a mall on an errand There they get into a fight over fidelity and decide to break up They reconcile and decide they still love each other They fight again and break up Then they get together again Can you figure the plot from that point on Yes I thought you could All this fighting and loving is done in front of random strangers That s what there is It is a film with a beginning and a middle but no end It is just arbitrarily cut off at the end of a cycle It would be one thing if these people were at least great conversationalists But this is no MY DINNER WITH ANDRE About all you learn from the conversation is that these are two very ordinary and superficial people Do you really care where they got their roll top desk and which of them is going to get it in the divorce settlement I know I do not You could easily save the admission price by going to your local mall and eavesdropping on the people there There are some things that Mazursky is more anxious to show us than others We do get to see the names of a lot of stores at the mall many of which surprise surprise are chains that you might find at your own local mall How fortuitous for the financing of the film Considerably less care is taken to show us what the characters are doing with their packages At one point each has bought a complete change of clothes which they are wearing No explanation is given for what happened to the clothes they had been wearing I guess in Beverly Hills everything you own is considered disposable If you genuinely find great humor in the awkward situation of seeing adults argue in public this predominantly one joke comedy might be for you If not it offers you surprisingly little considering the names involved I give it a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0939,Scenes from a Mall,1991,SCENES FROM A MALL is the new Paul Mazursky film starring Woody Allen Bette Midler and the Beverly Center shopping mall Paul Irwin the new vaudevillean appears as the mimic It s an incongruous casting idea putting Woody Allen the ultimate New Yorker in a Southern California mall with Bette Midler who may just be the last word in ditzy rich California If it had worked it would have been brilliant it didn t and it ain t All that is left to us the audience is assigning the blame First off there s Mazursky who when he s good is very very good However he seems constitutionally incapable of making two good movies in a row Now he s done nothing quite as wonderful as his early NEXT EXIT GREENWICH VILLAGE but his last Beverly Hills movie the name of which escapes me just now had a wonderful zany chaos about it a kind of kitchy UP STAIRS DOWN STAIRS that approached at least the lost art of the screwball comedy SCENES on the other hand instead of opening up Beverly Hills to satire and humanization traps us in its own self referential claustrophobia Several times Nick and Deborah the major characters almost succeed in breaking out of the mall only to be dragged back in by some circumstance or other Their failure to leave is the movie s failure too Then there s Woody Allen looking and sounding as natural and naturalized as a Martian at a Ku Klux Klan rally He s got a preposterous tuck of hair gathered in a teeny tiny ponytail That s the signal that he s a real California sports agent lawyer Allen is too familiar to us to be anything but Woody Allen and no one who knows Allen thinks that he would ever be a Californian Neither is there anything in his performance that in any way makes it possible for us to make the leap of faith to enable us to forget ANNIE HALL and a lifetime of slamming L A Finally there s Midler fussy and over upholstered as usual but totally unable to convince us that she is a licensed psychologist and successful self help author She s not the Beverly Hills princess she was in her previous B H films the one with Nick Nolte and company DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS or the one with Danny DeVito RUTHLESS PEOPLE Neither is the vulgarian with the heart of gold that she s played opposite Shelley Long OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE or in BEACHES What is she who is she how does she succeed either professionally or personally She hasn t a clue how the play Deborah and we haven t a clue how to read her If this is satire it is a cold uncaring kind If it is a tribute to SoCal culture it misses altogether I think of SCENES and then of L A STORY as the portrait of Lotus Land Steve Martin s got this movie beat all hollow because there is love behind his movie There is nothing behind Mazursky s I can recommend this film only to those fans who have to see everything with Allen and or Midler in it The rest of us would be better off shopping
0940,Sleeping with the Enemy,1991,SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY stars Julia Roberts as an abused wife who runs away to start a new life Although I always enjoy Roberts presence on the screen I have to say that this is far from being her best film Roberts herself turns in an energetic performance but I failed to detect any depth in her characterization of a potentially interesting and complex woman Neither did I detect anything in the story that added anything to my understanding of or gave me an insight into spousal abuse Roberts best film IMHO if you want to know was MYSTIC PIZZA everything that I can recall at this moment since then including STEEL MAGNOLIAS has been tainted with melodrama FLATLINERS is probably a reasonable contender for her second most interesting role Melodrama and a lack of originality are the problems with SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY Certainly the actors are attractive and competent Patrick Bergin who plays the husband gives the most interesting performance of the three principals but then the devil does always get the best lines The actor who plays the new boyfriend suffers perhaps from being too much a cute teddy bear and a too perfect would be lover a trifle less understanding forbearance and patience might have added some depth to his character Perfection is not good drama how ever much we might desire it in real life In other words once again the writer falls back on symmetry the bad husband the good boyfriend the hapless but not helpless woman in between Symmetry gives control and predictability to a design a certain formal elegance But some little touch of asymmetry adds interest and texture The story is only slightly interesting in places and too predictable throughout And the ending which recapitulates one of the movies weakest and cheapest surprise endings is a major let down It was a pretty good schtick thirty years ago for Simone Signoret in DIABOLIQUE it was campy fun in CARRIE it was the crowning touch of sleaziness in the very sleazy FATAL ATTRACTION And here it is inevitable I can recommend SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY to two groups only devoted fans of Julia Roberts and people who have to see everything despite their own instincts and others warnings
0941,Hamlet,1990,Before giving you a review of this film I must tell you that this review is skewed The day before I went to Hamlet I watched HENRY V on video Now that s quite an adaptation to the big screen As with any Shakespeare play the key to any production are the performances Face it the actors are working with the best material ever conceived by a man The only way to blow it is in the performance I guess a director could blow it but that would be hard most directors know that the most they can do is bring visual depth to a product rich in human depth Well it s sad to say the performances is this film are definitely not up to snuff Gibson stinks He does better in the action scenes but that s not the focus and even in those scenes he lacks the strength of projection needed for Hamlet He never is convincing especially when he s considering suicide Close s performance is not much better She plays Gertrude poorly you never get the feeling that Gertrude is evil just so stupid she falls from one man to another Even when she drinks the wine and dies her death is overdone and overblown Granted it s easy to take control of the screen when Gibson plays Hamlet so badly Now on a better note Polonius as played by Ian Holm and the woman who plays Ophelia are wonderful While I ve read that others thought Ophelia was unconvincing in the first part of the film I thought she played it right on She was shy and overpowered by the personalities around her she was bewildered by the conflicting messages and back biting I think her performance became apparently stronger over time because we saw more and more of her All in all a performance worthy of a best supporting actress nomination It s too bad I saw this film after watching HENRY V That was an incredible performance I hope the actor who played Harry will do another film with Shakespeare Don t go see HAMLET wait for the video and rent it some night when you have nothing else to do Enjoy the supporting performances but try to live with the leads If you want to see Shakespeare done right rent HENRY V or HAMLET as done by Olivier
0942,Dances with Wolves,1990,I m not a Western fan at all but when I first saw the trailer for DANCES WITh WOLVES last fall I knew I d go see it The photography in the movie is absolutely gorgeous Kevin Coster and the team that photographed the movie did a magnificent job The story is very simple on the surface A Union soldier asks to be posted to the frontier after he accidentally becomes a hero after being wounded in a battle Dunbar Costner wants to see the frontier before it becomes shopping malls and I can t say I blame him He wants to see buffaloes His post turns out to be a deserted sod hut on the prairie He s alone and while he wonders why his relief never shows up he enjoys his solitude Eventually the local Indians find him and they learn to trust one another Communication between them is quite difficult but it is made a little easier when a white woman who has lived with the Indians since her childhood agrees to make the white man s talk The woman Stands with Fist is portrayed by Mary McDonell The Indian holy man Kicking Bird is portrayed by Graham Greene Greene gives a wonderful performance and McDonell s is a little more tentative though so is her character Gradually Dunbar spends more and more time with the Indians In the movie s highlight he joins them on a buffalo hunt which is a magnificently photographed sequence Costner deserves enormous credit in pulling that one off Most of the movie is quite subtle and understated The photography is the real star the long shots of the prairie So when reality intrudes about a half hour before the ending of the film it s jarring I suspect the people who gripe about revisionism in the movie are complaining about this portion of the film The movie is quite long and leisurely but never boring It also feels quite realistic until the ending While I still think AWAKENINGS was the best movie of last year DANCES WITH WOLVES is so strong for so long that it comes close to being a great movie For a first directorial effort Costner deserves an A Aside from the ending the Barry score is the film s other major weakness John Barry hasn t written an original score in many years He wrote a nice military piece that s used in the beginning but isn t used for the rest of the movie Barry s score is okay and it suits the movie but it isn t at all original If you ve seen KING KONG the remake Moderator or OUT OF AFRICA or MOONRAKER you ve heard the score already This movie is an 8 on the Chuck scale I think it will win Best Picture Best Actor and Best Cinematography
0943,Scenes from a Mall,1991,Capsule Review A terrible movie about marriage and infidelity Woody Allen and Bette Midler go to the mall for a quick errand Instead they take us on a trek of their sixteen year relationship There s only so much humor in watching these two people fight Rating 3 4 to 4 I wouldn t recommend renting this on video even a free one I m not a big Woody Allen fan although I did like SLEEPER and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN I wasn t hoping for a SLEEPER quality film but I was expecting something much better from a master such as Allen SCENES FROM A MALL is a very boring movie I ll go further than that this was a terrible movie stay home and save your money This movie has nothing good to say about relationships Very much like WAR OF THE ROSES this movie continues on insisting to find something funny about healthy relationships falling apart It s depressing to see a loving couple married sixteen years fighting People go to the movies to escape if your relationship is in trouble you would be better off not to see this film This movie was billed as a comedy If anything I left the theater wanting to ensure that my relationships never get to the sorry state that Nick Allen and Deborah Bette Midler were in Couples argue enough in this world I don t need to pay full movie rates to see them Not only that but this show was just under an hour and a half I counted an hour and twenty minutes but I was told it was longer than that Given how short the movie was it seemed like a three hour movie No plot no action no lessons to be learned Just two people arguing and taking low blows at each other I suppose to be fair I should comment on the scenes that were entertaining Allen walking through a crowded mall with a s lime green surf board is funny Although this also got boring The first ten minutes of carrying the board was funny after that I kept trying to figure out the symbolism of the board I decided that whoever carred the board was the person trying to put the relationship back together When the board switched hands the feelings of both persons changed When they finally lost the board the relationship appeared to be back to normal Maybe it was just me but I failed to see much of the humor in the movie The audience seemed to think that the Santa sled on Allen s roof was pretty funny and again with the twin Saabs in the garage I was probably so depressed from all the fighting that the humor went right over my head but I don t think so
0944,Doors The,1991,REVIEW THE DOORS Starring Val Kilmer Meg Ryan Kyle McLachlan Kevin Dillon Crispin Glover Oliver Stone s THE DOORS is the story of Jim Morrison his rise to stardom his turbulent life and the man behind the music It is also the story of the turbulent 60s and the large role it played in Morrison s life Oddly enough it is not about the group The Doors if it were it would have spent more time describing the lives of the other group members and not just Jim Morrison Nevertheless it is an interesting movie and one worth checking out Compliments to Kilmer I think he became Morrison Stone paints a surrealistic portrait of a man haunted by ghosts from his past a past of which the film tells little about as much of this film does with everything It is known that Morrison s family did not cooperate with the makers of this film so Stone and company are only left to speculate about his childhood and adolescence So to make up for this lack of knowledge the film focuses on his drug taking and alcoholic way of life and his overpowering obsession with death Oliver Stone supplements his telling of Morrison s story with the equally surrealistic poetry Morrison wrote while he was still alive This film could be seen as a two hour and twenty minute music video with nothing to offer as far as a plot except how Jim Morrison lived behind the scenes On the other hand this film could be viewed as what I like to call the 60s in a Valium capsule take one dose and you know everything there is to know about the 60s Something like a decade immortalized in celluloid Oliver Stone is known to make movies about things that affect him personally He made PLATOON which was based on his experiences in Vietnam and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY which was the story of Vietnam Vet Ron Kovic The 60s must have affected him as equally as the Vietnam War did This film makes you feel as though you are looking through the mind of Jim Morrison but you also feel as though Oliver Stone is deliberately trying to put you there All the time lapse photography frame superimposing varying camera angles and fades to white along with the subconscious sounds of The Doors make you make you feel as if this is one big acid trip On the other hand it makes you feel as if you are having a vision of life in several radically different perspectives This kind of filmmaking is always subject to the personal tastes of the individual some may find it engrossing and innovative and some may just wind up with a migraine headache by the end of the movie Perhaps a better title for this film would have been one from one of the books about Jim Morrison NO ONE GETS OUT OF HERE ALIVE Another might have been THE MORRISON STORY because this film is not really about The Doors as much about Morrison himself Although Morrison is the center of this story Oliver Stone presents the setting of the 60s to be a potent competitor for the title role Was he making a movie about Jim Morrison The Doors or the 60s That s a question you will have to figure out for yourself I personally found THE DOORS to be somewhat entertaining It provides some insight into why Jim Morrison was the way he was and how the turbulent 60s played a deciding role in his life It s not so much the story that people may disagree over after all there s not that much story to disagree about but the way it is told This film is what I consider to be true escapist entertainment It places you in a different setting a different place and a different time If that s what you crave in movie THE DOORS is a good vehicle for consideration Go see it it s worth at least a matinee
0945,Doors The,1991,Cast Val Kilmer Meg Ryan Kyle MacLachlan Frank Whaley Kevin Dillon Director Oliver Stone Screenplay Jay Randal Johnson and Oliver Stone The show is about to begin We look around at the audience my husband and I wondering how many people in the theatre were old enough to form sentences when Morrison died Half Less than half Will the young ones get it or will they be mesmerized By now you ve probably seen pictures of Kilmer as Morrison It s uncanny Tumbled locks of hair slightly parted lips the eyes bemused What was there about that face about Morrison Like Rudolf Valentino he had a femininity that attracted females Like James Dean he had a rebellious streak that attracted males And like Janis Joplin he had a self destructive urge that attracted and repelled would be saviors THE DOORS is a disturbing film A relentless soundtrack visually skewed images warped colors and shamanistic shapes combine into an assault on the senses Fascinated we watch Just as his fans did Like moths drawn to a bonfire Who lit the fire that consumed Morrison Was it his fans His band His girlfriend His parents His own visions Was he an overrated rock star An underrated poet Stone s film is like a documentary scene after scene replayed vaguely familiar We want to hear Morrison explain what happened to him but he doesn t We want to turn him away from that bathtub in Paris but we can t Morrison is beautiful and he is hateful He gives his soul to his fans and he attacks his friends He is naive and innocent one moment brutal and pretentious the next This film is about excesses and pushing past limits In a sense the 60 s were about that too Break the old boundaries they no longer apply They were our parents rules but we are free of their restrictions We can do anything The limits though weren t the problem Morrison and drugs and death weren t the solution It is said that every generation must define meaning for itself and fortunately most of us survive the experience even if we fail the test Perhaps we use our leaders as scouts cheering them as they blaze the trail We follow much later if at all In Morrison s case well we watched Icarus fall from the sky his wings melted He plunges into the sea in this case a bathtub in Paris in 1971 The closing scene is at Pere Lachaise a cemetery in Paris We see the quiet graves of Chopin Berlioz Moliere The last shot is of Morrison s grave graffiti strewn and candlelit It s an unquiet grave anointed by the adoration of fans who still worship his self consuming fire Yet some have learned the lesson Will this film renew the lesson or renew the blind passion To his credit Stone doesn t hit us in the face with A Message He sends us clippings instead and forces us to tie the pieces together He turns the camera on Morrison Kilmer frequently showing us Kilmer s back so that we are literally following Morrison to his death Kilmer is magnificent He speaks pure babble as if it were Shakespeare and he absolutely commands a crowd even when he can t focus on it Kilmer wore black contact lenses to make his pupils look dilated The lenses had the added effect of screwing up his equilibrium All of the concert shots feature Kilmer s vocals which means that he not only looks and acts like Morrison he sounds like him too Kilmer is so good that the original band members had trouble distinguishing some of the cuts Val sings from ones sung by Jim When viewing some of the footage guitarist Robby Krieger said I m really glad that we finally got The End We never got a recording of that live with Jim Now we ve got it Kilmer has recreated Morrison It s eerie Frightening like a voice from the grave I ask again will the young ones get it or will they be mesmerized The camera you see is in love with Morrison Kilmer it can t resist him and neither can the audience Morrison s dazed eyes have come back to haunt another generation Let s hope this generation knows a dead end when they see one
0946,Doors The,1991,Yes after watching Oliver Stone s an appropriate last name for the director of this movie THE DOORS you remember it even if you really weren t there I saw the Doors at Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco back in 1968 or was it 67 At that time we were really into the San Francisco Sound a la Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Jefferson Airplane the Grateful Dead the Sons of Chaplin Moby Grape QuickSilver Messenger Service etc So on this one night when this LA Band showed up on stage with Morrison and his black leather pants hey we were more into knee high leather moccasins paisley shirts and stuff slithering across the stage on his belly while reciting his poetry Dylan was more my kind of poet we had rather mixed feelings about the experience Somehow The Doors just didn t fit into the atmosphere in old Avalon Ballroom that night Somehow you really got the impression that Morrison was on a less than healthy trip so in 71 when I heard of his death I wasn t surprised at all I really dug this Oliver Stone movie even though I found it somewhat depressing Naturally a movie about the self destruction of a rock hero during a very turbulent age would tend to be depressing I found myself trying to sift from this movie any positive memories of that era I could There were many positive idealist though naive aspects of the counter culture movement especially around the San Francisco Bay Area But unfortunately that movement was born by drugs and eventually died by drugs The Doors was brilliantly filmed acted and directed and caught the very strange exciting and destructive character of that time It s probably a movie you will either want to see three or four times or else not even once depending on your taste and background
0947,Doors The,1991,Oliver Stone and Val Kilmer have done it they have captured perfectly the feel of my Sixties in the new film THE DOORS a film which will surely be on many ten best lists come December and which ought to be in for several important Academy nominations unless the curse of spring release strikes again Stone has always shown the most amazing talent for recreating the look and feel of that turbulent time as he did in PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY But Stone s movies have always been flawed by what a friendly reviewer might see as an excess of zeal and an unfriendly one as the sledge hammer approach to making a point But unlike his earlier films THE DOORS does not seem to have a political point it wants to drive home above all other considerations it definitely lacks Stone s usual smug superiority and instead concentrates on making Jim Morrison live for us again in the form of Val Kilmer Val Kilmer is the second actor this late winter early spring who absolutely must be nominated for an Academy Award the other being Anthony Hopkins in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS What price did Kilmer have to pay to so perfectly become the driven visionary besotted Morrison the Bacchus and Orpheus of many in my generation I was impressed the last time I saw Kilmer in a little film noir about a failing detective who gets involved with a devious thief and murderer played by his wife Joyce Whalley Kilmer I had no notion of what the man was capable of as an actor What he does by way of becoming Morrison goes beyond acting into black magic He looks like Morrison he sounds like Morrison even to doing Morrison s vocals on top of the original Doors instrumental tracks he moves like Morrison He scares us and disgusts us and fascinates us even as Jim Morrison did The film takes a mostly unblinking look at the demon that drove Morrison It offers no insights or answers It merely says this is him in action make what you will of it Unfortunately one result is that the other Doors are unfairly neglected especially Ray Manzarek played here by Kyle MacLachlan Manzarek was probably the unindicted co conspirator who as much as Morrison made the unique and unnerving Doors sound The other two Doors were Robby Krieger Frank Whaley Joyce s brother and John Densmore Kevin Dillon both of whom play rather minor roles Morrison is important as an artist in his own right but for the movie his significance is that of the supreme type the very summation and embodiment of the Sixties rock culture He is a cultural icon and as such is as mixed a bag as my own memories of those times terror and ecstasy living on the edge and barely conscious all at the same time We see and judge Morrison and the times on the strength of the music the words the actions the script the photography and the sound track Stone and J Randal Johnson wrote a wonderful script that captures the essence fully and honestly The script gives exactly the right moments we need The pacing makes the 135 minute running time both timeless and instantaneous exactly the way I used to perceive or be deceived by time when I was stoned on acid in those days The music is in some ways the story and Densmore and Krieger were involved creatively in the making of the movie I note There are 28 Doors songs in the sound track and a heavy promotion in the music stores The concert scenes are perfect I sat there in the dark saying Yes this is the way it was this is how it felt As for the photography it is bold imaginative and innovative Like the concerts the drug trips are real exactly right It s taken more than two decades since Hollywood started trying to film a trip before someone got it right even the trips in EASY RIDER fail to convince and evoke the way these do And then there are the hallucinogenic figures that accompany Morrison his shaman the bald figure enigmatic suggestive seen only by Morrison and us and maybe once by Pam Morrison played wonderfully well by Meg Ryan who has never been one of my personal faves until now The film s attitude to drugs and to alcohol for Morrison was an alcoholic as much as a druggie is accepting without being approving these people were stoned more or less all the time and it killed some of them But whether Morrison could have been Morrison without them is not a question the movie is interested in Will THE DOORS speak to people who weren t hippies and or Doors fans I suspect it will For people like me it speaks loudly and clearly I recommend this movie to everyone except those who cannot tolerate rough language sex drug use and or frontal nudity in their films or their lives
0948,Return of the Musketeers The,1989,I actually saw this film It s just been released on video in Britain I d been hearing mumblings that it was a very poor follow up to the other films and that s why it never got released to theaters here Sad to say it s true A few facts first It is an adaptation by George Macdonald Fraser of TWENTY YEARS AFTER rather than an original sequel and it s directed by Richard Lester The cast members returning from the previous films are York Reed Chamberlain Finlay and surprise upon surprise Christopher Lee it was only a flesh wound no that s not a direct quote Oh and Roy Kinnear of course though it should be noted that he died in a horse accident while this film was being made the film is dedicated to him Jean Pierre Cassell reappears as well though not as Louis XIII but in a brief role as Cyrano de Bergerac And I think that the actor playing Cardinal Mazarin is the same as the one who played M de Treville in the first film The other two major cast members are C Thomas Howell as Athos adoptive son the Vicomte de Bragelone and Kim Catrall as the vengeful daughter of Milady de Winter The trouble with the film is that it s completely listless Everyone plays their roles as if they don t really want to be there It doesn t have half the adventure or humor of either of the previous films The most amusing piece in the film is the little more than a cameo performance by Cassell as Cyrano and what makes it even more aggravating is that that bit doesn t seem like it even belongs Catrall did an excellent job in the fencing department but as a villainess she s no Faye Dunaway and just wasn t convincing Howell did well but it seemed as if he felt he was just a hanger on rather than a true part of the proceedings No doubt that if the film is released on video in the US anyone who is a Musketeers fan will feel obliged to rent it I feel bad about not recommending it but I don t recommend it
0949,Cyrano de Bergerac,1990,Over the past twelve months or so we have seen releases of film versions of three classic stage plays Brannagh s HENRY V Zeffirilli s HAMLET and Jean Paul Rappeneau s CYRANO DE BERGERAC For production quality and for entertainment value I find it very easy to pick HAMLET for third place Choosing between first and second place is somewhat harder but for both production quality and pure entertainment value I give the edge to CYRANO This is likely to remain the best adaptation of the story to film we will see in our lifetimes and very likely the most entertaining even if we include Steve Martin s popular modern reframing ROXANNE CYRANO DE BERGERAC is of course an adaptation of Edmond Rostand s popular play first presented in 1897 Rostand took some poetic liberty incidentally but Cyrano was a genuine historic figure who was soldier expert swordsman poet playwright philosopher and even a science fiction writer His best known literary work today is A VOYAGE TO THE MOON which is why Rostand put so many references to moon travel in the play Cyrano suggested several means of extra terrestrial propulsion mostly absurd but on one he got lucky Cyrano de Bergerac was the man who first suggested that space travel might be possible using rocket propulsion The story is of the noble swordsman who would like to woo his beautiful cousin but is stigmatized by his own prodigious nose When it turns out that an inarticulate but handsome soldier under Cyrano s command also loves her Cyrano agrees to help the soldier The soldier will provide the good looks and Cyrano will provide the words The story packs into a surprisingly small space comedy tragedy drama action and adventure This production cost seventeen million dollars and taking into account modern production costs that was something of a bargain considering the number of detailed sets costumes and even battle scenes Presumably shooting in Hungary kept prices down Director Jean Paul Rappeneau co authored the script with Jean Claude Carriere editing down the Rostand and occasionally adding some of their own lines The film is in French with English subtitles by novelist Anthony Burgess who had previously translated the play The producers decided that for each foreign language in which the film would be subtitled they would get where possible the best known translator of the play into that language to do the subtitles for the film Gerard Depardieu has a very natural style as Cyrano that Jose Ferrer lacked in the previously best known film version His nose also looks surprisingly real thanks to the contributions of Michele Burke who receives on screen credit for creating the nose Special notice should be given to a fine score by Jean Claude Petit who produced many very good themes For action scenes his score sounds not unlike Danny Elfman s score for BATMAN but Petit also has some very melodic themes for other emotions CYRANO DE BERGERAC is a top flight production I give it a 3 on the 4 to 4 scale
0951,Ju Dou,1990,Synopsis In 1920s China an old man the owner of a dye factory buys a beautiful young wife He beats her every night because she has not produced children an heir Meanwhile his young wife and his adopted son have an affair which results in the birth of a child A tale of adultery revenge and murder Even though it has superb photography and excellent acting the story falls flat and the film is primarily a mediocre melodrama China English subtitles color 1990 94 minutes Director Zhang Yi mou This film has received considerable publicity recently because the Chinese government has repressed the film in China the film is banned there Also the film has been nominated for a U S Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category The Chinese government asked that the film be withdrawn from Academy Award consideration on the grounds that it has not been screened in its country of origin a point of considerable controversy The film is set in a dye factory in 1920s China The factory is owned by a cruel old man whose only laborer is his adopted son The old man buys a beautiful young bride Ju Dou his third wife he beat to death the first two wives The old man is apparently impotent every night he savagely beats Ju Dou because she is not yet pregnant In one scene Ju Dou is tied up while the old man is beating her he tells her when I buy an animal I treat it as I wish and you re no better than an animal Ju Dou and Tian qing the adopted son of the mill owner are attracted to each other One day when the old man is away the pair become lovers with Ju Dou actively seducing Tian qing Soon she is pregnant with Tian qing s child Shortly thereafter the old man is crippled in an accident and confined to a crude wheelchair The story continues with the birth of the child and the two lovers confronting the social limits on their relationship adultery being punishable by death The film is excellent in many respects The photography is beautiful the set design is very colorful with shards of dyed cloth hanging from the rafters of the dye factory The acting is generally excellent with a superb performance by Li Wei as the cruel sadistic factory owner who thinks he can make his wives pregnant by beating them The film Direction is good also Director Zhang Yi mou s earlier works include RED SORGHUM Some of the writing is very good also However despite having so much going for it the film quickly turns into a predictable melodrama Because the story weakens so much in the second half the film is not as good as for example A GIRL FROM HUNAN or the soap opera ish THE REINCARNATION OF GOLDEN LOTUS Although it is not as good as some other Chinese films whether from China Taiwan Hong Kong the film suggests that the stagnation in the film industry of China may be ending The events in Tienamen Square and the crackdown afterward seriously disrupted the film industry in China I recommend the film to fans of melodrama and to anyone that appreciates Chinese films Distribution In its first U S release currently 3 15 showing in the San Francisco area San Francisco Gateway Cinema May be available in other areas also showing primarily in arthouse type theaters The U S distributor for the film is Miramax Films
0952,Closet Land,1991,CLOSET LAND is a movie written and directed by Radha Bharadwaj The cast consists in its entirety of Madeleine Stowe and Alan Rickman Yes a two actor movie No one else appears on the screen through the entire running time The movie has attracted some talented and well known people to become involved with it Ron Howard is one of the executive producers and Janet Meyers is the producer Philip Glass is credited with something like creative musical direction the meaning of which is vague but the sound track does have a Glassian quality to it It has also attracted a number well known backers to pay for it The names Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Sundance Pepsi and Coors appear in the credits too As well as that of Amnesty International Amnesty International is certainly central to CLOSET LAND which is about a woman being interrogated and tortured to make her sign a confession that her children s book is politically subversive This is a movie about the horror of torture and the ability of the human mind to resist CLOSET LAND transpires almost entirely in one all purpose room and consists of Rickman and Stowe alternately torturing and being tortured in physical emotional and psychological ways The worst bloodiest violence as in a Greek tragedy takes place in the dialogue descriptions and away from the view of the audience The rest is nakedly exposed to us The most interesting thing about the story is that at one dramatic moment the victim and the tormentor trade places From then on he knows he can t win no matter what else happens and she knows she can t lose even if she can t escape I don t think I have even seen this before The weakest aspect of the movie is that it is definitely a filmed play and not a movie as such Nothing is done that couldn t be done on a live stage The film maker uses animation and a few limited special effects but a creative director could give us exactly the end results on stage The movie is extremely talkative limited to one set and two actors It induces in the audience extreme claustrophobia and general tension which is to the good and part of the message of the film but it also limits the audience that will tolerate it Certainly the strongest parts of the movie are its point of view and its actors The point of view I ll leave mostly to those of you who will be lucky enough to see CLOSET LAND for it has a very limited release but it may show up in the better video stores in a few months Suffice it to say that the film s view of political violence abduction terror and torture is both complex and unequivocal Indeed the hope it offers against these evils is decidedly of a spiritual and or moral sort that may be of little comfort to the materialists amongst us but which comforts informs and ennobles the struggle against torture and its kin The actors are perfectly wonderful One would be hard pressed to say who outacts the other Rickman is the more identifiable as a movie actor for me he has often played intellectual heavies and so his performance is less surprising perhaps His character is an actor too in a way and so he gets the fun of playing an actor acting which is always impressive I think Stowe is less familiar to me but I won t soon forget the moral commitment she brought to her performance her appearance is amazingly flexible and she has a marvelous sense of her body in her acting She also projects complete conviction whether she s terrified outraged or triumphant CLOSET LAND is one of the roughest movies I have sat through in a long time because it is one of the truest and it personally challenges me as the audience to measure up to its outrage and its ideals I recommend it highly to all who get a chance to see it
0953,Guilty by Suspicion,1991,An artist painting a picture has the option of reproducing exactly what the eye sees or of distorting reality to reach a deeper truth The artist who just reproduces reality may be little more than a human camera the artists whom we consider to be great have known how to distort reality to show a greater truth It is possible to make a film about a subject that is realistic and at the same time does a disservice by being so realistic Irwin Winkler s GUILTY BY SUSPICION based on his own script is a very realistic and at the same time subdued portrait of a blacklisted film director But what is called for is a howl of rage against the government subversion of the Bill of Rights Martin Ritt s THE FRONT which starred Woody Allen does have that release at its climax GUILTY BY SUSPICION whimpers its way up to a modified version of an exchange that actually took place during the Army McCarthy Hearings but it is not nearly as effective as Allen telling the government to go fuck itself GUILTY BY SUSPICION mixes real Hollywood figures such as Darryl Zanuck with purely fictional ones and ones who are thinly disguised versions of real actors like cowboy star Jerry Cooper The story begins as one of Zanuck s best directors David Merrill played by Robert DeNiro returns to Hollywood in 1951 after having been in Paris for a while However Hollywood is not the town he remembers The House Un American Activities Committee and the FBI are conducting a witch hunt to find Communist sympathizers in the film industry Careers are being destroyed and marriages broken up by the paranoia and the government pressure David sees the family of a friend destroyed and soon he too is called upon to explain his attendance at a few meetings of what is now accused of being a Communist front organization He is willing to cooperate until he is required to start by giving names of involved associates For refusing to draw others into the net he finds himself blacklisted The project he is working on is canceled and the studio nearly bankrupts him by insisting he return a 50 000 advance What follows is a long and not entirely interesting siege of unemployment seasoned with FBI harassment The film builds to his eventual hearing with HUAC Winkler spent a fair amount of the budget recreating the early 1950s much more than Martin Ritt did or needed to do for THE FRONT I thought while watching the film that some of the women s hair styles were anachronistic but I could easily be wrong The period feel was somehow just missing as was the dramatic edge of the film DeNiro s character is weak and indecisive and spending so much time showing him not finding work just does not grab the audience the way it could I give the film a flat 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0954,Doors The,1991,I wrote this title after seeing THE DOORS IN EUROPE a documentary of the original Doors performances That movie made a worshipper out of me Then I was brought down hard by NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE the biography Jim made so many deadly errors it s a wonder he didn t die sooner But although the book killed my hero worship it did not kill my love for the guy But what difference does it make No woman could have broken through to Jim All my love s in vain Total failure No blame Jim talked of women as meager food for souls for God What woman could win out in the face of such a total negation So I was prepared to find Oliver Stone s DOORS a grueling experience As a great admirer of Stone s artistry I was afraid that he would successfully revive the past the feeling and meaning of it I was 17 in 68 and if he was successful Stone could make me relive my feelings I was prepared for that but it didn t happen Instead I was able to compose this review in my head during most of the movie The music was there and the fashions and all but nothing touched me as it should have Perhaps the problem was that Jim Morrison was not just a guy in the crowd that a mere camera could capture Jim was a soul who was doomed to be the spirit of his times He was racked on the extremes of those times He was born into a proto typical American family his mother a neglected nag and his father Mr Megadeath a nuclear war expert in the army He appeared to be normal and conforming like every other boy did But he caught a spirit from those Indians He passed puberty just as Rock and Roll was being born He came of drafting age during the War in Vietnam He came to consciousness just as LSD was invented He discovered love during the Summer of Love He briefly became a father when the red tide of abortion reached its peak In himself he was the times and he did his best to work out those terrible internal external conflicts and make something positive emerge from the struggle into his poetry and to give that good thing to others That s why I love his soul because he was the anti Hitler He fought harder than his father who was the youngest general in the navy Jim s personal struggle took him farther faster Don t underestimate the audience Jim said They want the sacred Stone s movie fails to deliver One can hardly blame Stone for that Maybe Jim s soul was just too big to capture Or maybe I just expected too much after viewing THE DOORS IN EUROPE Or maybe it was because I m a woman looking back at a time of life and a time in history when men and women just didn t see the same things I can find myself in the movie only as a rag of Indian silk a boney body and a hank of hair My experience is locked on the wrong side of those heavily made up eyes Maybe I should not have expected Stone to revive those times for me but actually I think that the movie missed all the points Things didn t ring true or have the impact they should have had For instance in the scene where Jim tells his wife to kill their baby I can t believe that Patricia replied to that by criticizing Jim s recent weight gain That is not how the scene could have been or how it is described in NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE Everything in the movie was like that for me just not right So I left the theatre competely unmoved and unable to write the review I wanted to write I suggest seeing the documentary and reading the poetry
0955,Perfect Weapon The,1991,First of all let s get one thing straight martial arts films are not in the same league with major motion action pictures There is for some reason a lack of large budgets good writers and great actors who can do both martial arts and emotion Those actors who know martial arts and have been in the business for a long time James Caan etc have no desire to do martial arts films So let s look at the scale of stardom here I rate ENTER THE DRAGON as four star not for its plot or its great fight scenes but because it did more than any other film for its day Bruce was dynamic on film and was great in his motion ABOVE THE LAW was a one star no range of emotion the same techniques were repeated over and over and over That being said I liked THE PERFECT WEAPON Not because Jeff Speakman the staring role was such a great actor or had a great range of emotion or that the film was non stop action from start to finish It was none of these things Although Mr Speakman is a credible actor he is certainly better at emoting than Seagal he is not in the league of top billed actors but then again he never claims to be He claims he can act and he can Enough said What I did like about the movie was the little things the one liner that Jeff pulls off Unlike Seagal s badder than all attitude Speakman tries to deal with the fact that he doesn t want to kill people though he still does I like the kid who helps him He is a more natural actor and helps the movie He is not just a foil who constantly gets in the way or into trouble No one in this movie seemed incompetent Many movies have some dumb cop who cannot get untangled from his own limbs to get an arrest not here Speakman gets bruised He gets hit and then has a bruise that lasts I thought bruises went away in ten minutes He is The Perfect Weapon not because he is so good only because he is an outsider Most movies would have made it because he is invincible He loses a fight to low odds It is not ten to one where he loses granted I was curious how he could get kicked so many time and not go down but goes down to this one attack but hey he does go down Okay the script is predictable there are no surprises You see the ending long before it happens it is obvious But I like the way he moved the way he hit and kept hitting until all opponents were down No attacker waits until a previous attacker is beaten until he attacks all attacks seem very realistic A look at the movie This is a revenge movie essentially a troubled kid is placed in Kenpo training to teach him to control his anger After years of training and a falling out with his father he meets up with his old Oriental friend who got him into karate when he was young The man played by Mako is in trouble with the Korean mafia and is killed by Tanaka his real last name and character name The movie follows Speakman trying to unravel who did it and get revenge for his friends death Most predictable But all in all a good movie I will give it two stars A workman first effort with a little too much commercialism on the Kenpo name but also good choreographed fight scenes that need closer scrutiny under slow mo and stop action
0956,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze,1991,Yes the Turtles are back and I got a chance to preview them at a local S I D S foundation fundraiser Vanilla Ice was even there ohh ahh but I m not a rap fan so I didn t pay too much attention to him This film has many of the same flaws of its predecessor Unfortunately it also suffers from How do we end this disease The filmmakers come up with some interesting ideas during the first half of the film and then they fail to develop any of them The last one third of the film is one corny illogical scene after another The first Turtles film was made to cash in on the craze but it had a certain amount of story to it that was based on a mixture of Eastman and Laird s comics the animated series and the writer s imagination This is strictly mind candy that is designed to entice kids into talking their parents out of some pocket money The Turtles are living with April O Neil while looking for a new hideout They make a new friend a pizza delivery boy who also knows martial arts The Shredder comes back I d consider that a spoiler except that the TV ads have not only been showing that information but they have actually been showing pieces of the surprise ending How the Shredder survived a 7 8 story fall into a garbage truck and subsequent crushing by the trash masher is unexplained The rest of the movie involves the Turtles discovery of the origin of the radioactive ooze that created them and Shredder s simultaneous discovery of it and his use of it in his revenge This is a kid s film all the way More than half of the jokes are drawn from the first movie though some of the rest are funny The violence is toned down a bit from the first movie though there are more actual confrontations between the Turtles and the Foot Clan My son enjoyed it and I didn t see anything in the film that would harm any child s psyche My prediction is that this film will be out of the theatres in a few weeks and appear on video in November just in time to be put in a bunch of Turtle Kid s stockings Bottom Line Thumbs down if you re an adult Kids are less critical and just want to see Turtles I have to admit that I was disappointed because I was one of the minority of adults who liked the first movie It wasn t Oscar material but it was a decent rendition of the Turtle s story SECRET OF THE OOZE is the dog that I was afraid the first movie would be C est la Vie Scott Schultz uunet microsoft scottsc or uw beaver microsoft scottsc
0957,State of Grace,1990,Late last year three gangster movies involving some of the world s best actors and directors were released at the same time GOODFELLAS MILLER S CROSSING and STATE OF GRACE STATE OF GRACE may have received the least attention of the three at least it was the one I did not catch in the theatres I did enjoy GOODFELLAS and MILLER S CROSSING a lot and generally enjoy movies about the psychology of criminals and the workings of organized crime So I recently caught STATE OF GRACE on video and although I don t think it is as good as the other two films mentioned above I thought it offered some great moments and a great performance by Gary Oldman I don t know much about Gary Oldman He s British I saw him recently in ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD where he gives another great performance and also in PRICK UP YOUR EARS Does anyone know more about his film credits and background He seems to have had some training as a classical actor as he jumps around with grace and abandon and seems to know fencing In STATE OF GRACE he broke my heart with his performance as a slightly out of control hyper active messy violent and alcoholic gangster who visibly aches for love and something worth fighting for This is the sort of character that Eric Roberts plays so well the kid who could not sit still in class and whose life has gone straight down hill since the third grade It s a memorable and manic performance and next to seeing Annette Bening naked in THE GRIFTERS one of the highlights of my movie year I think Oldman outshines Sean Penn in STATE OF GRACE one of Penn s more low key performances Penn can still communicate more with his face and body language than most screen actors can do with a hundred great lines But Oldman has the better part in this extremely violent movie about Irish gangsters being swept away by changing times in lower Manhattan Penn seems a little tired and depressed in this film and he shows some influence of Robert DeNiro who he seems to be imitating in the way he reads certain lines I also wasn t thrilled by the violence in STATE OF GRACE It seemed gratuitous to me lots of showy bloody slow motion shoot outs with bags of fake blood exploding all over the place This sort of cinema ultra violence went out with Butch Cassidy and Bonnie and Clyde at least I thought so Another problem with the movie the script focused on an ethnic subculture and old way of life under attack but none of the lead characters seemed very ethnic to me Ed The Abyss Harris gives a good performance as a ruthless SOB but there s nothing very Irish about him The same goes for the lovely Robin Wright the princess of THE PRINCESS BRIDE who shows she is not just a beautiful ex model but a promising and interesting actress in her role as the younger sister of gangsters trying to live a decent life and distance herself from her shameful family and past Also Burgess Meredith hams it up as an old sot a character a lot like the one he plays in the Rocky movies Is Burgess Meredith alive or dead Seriously I thought he died If so this must have been one of his last roles Funny I recently saw THE FIELD where the characters were definitely Irish but which suffered from an overwrought and silly script The script for STATE OF GRACE by Dennis McIntyre was very good I thought but needed some real Irish people to bring it to life And less contrived special effects violence to distract us from the human tragedy Where was Mickey Rourke when we needed him
0958,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,The story would have worked great as a straight documentary but they tried to play it as a monster in the house thriller As a result there were more loose ends than you see in a Deal a Meal commercial The biggest flaw a real whopper was that the main bad guy Anthony Hopkins after a lengthy escape sequence simply removed himself from the plot about two thirds of the way into the film not to figure in the climax and resolution at all In an attempt to smooth this over the main character Jodie Foster announces gratuitously to a minor character that the bad guy will not be heard of again and goes off to deal with bad guy number two All the main conflict was based around the heroine trying to get from bad guy number one information about bad guy number two whom we did not even meet until well into the film Once she had as much info as she was going to get about half way into the film the lengthy escape sequence contributed absolutely nothing to the plot The only excuse a poor one is that it really happened that way Of course I didn t know that and since he was the genius at psychology and she the talented beginner I kept expecting Jodie to be proven wrong for the main bad guy to show up when we least expected him The other shoe never dropped and I felt very dissatisfied Wait a minute Is it over Whaaa Well he did get a joke cameo at the very end after Jodie had vanquished the bogeyman which she somehow accomplished despite her utter incompetence in the monster in the house scene I still don t know how she offed him in a pitch dark room with him wearing infra red glasses and carrying a pistol while she was flailing around helplessly on the floor Some people in the audience apparently thought it was scary but I thought it was just dumb She s supposed to be one of the brightest recent grads of FBI school and she doesn t know the first thing about hostage situations Oh well the monster gave her a second chance to get it right Jodie Foster did not turn in nearly as good a performance as she usually does The high points of the film were Anthony Hopkins s portrayal of the demented psychologist and the creepy images of the insane asylum although those scenes were marred by an auditory cue a deep rumble in the sound track which was no doubt intended to make the audience uncomfortable and which in my case at least succeeded I wonder what Orion Pictures will come up with next audience thumb screws to heighten anticipation
0959,Perfectly Normal,1990,PERFECTLY NORMAL is a Canadian film directed by Yves Simoneau produced by Michael Burns and starring Robbie Coltrane Michael Riley Deborah Duchane and Kenneth Walsh It is wonderful funny fresh exciting and completely satisfying Alonzo Robbie Coltrane is the vast pushy sleazy operatic con man cum restaurateur who unbidden unwanted and irresistible moves in with Renzo Michael Riley Renzo is so withdrawn and self contained as to be almost catatonic seemingly incapable of doing anything but working by day in a brewery driving his late father s cab by night drawing up plans for house he d probably never build and playing goalie on the company hockey team this is a Canadian movie after all Alonzo takes charge of Renzo s life and most certainly brings a weird liveliness to it as does Deborah Duchane s character who pretty much has to seduce Renzo and who has one of the funnier bits in a very funny movie when she asks Renzo The movie is populated with several wonderful characters such as Renzo s friend at the brewery his boss and hockey coach the coach s girl friend Deborah Duchane s girl friend whose sexual fantasies provide us with a kind of leitmotiv throughout inter alios The movie ends with two moments of high magic and a bit in between that I don t understand Anyone who seen PERFECTLY NORMAL please e mail me I have a question I need to ask The director of photography was Alain Dostie and the music was by Richard Gregoire They both deserve high marks indeed Some wonderful stuff in the brewery and elsewhere and the music through was central to the movie Please do yourself a favor and seek out PERFECTLY NORMAL Ask your art house exhibitor why he she isn t showing it In Seattle it is playing at the Metro Cinema without any visible support no display ads no handbills It deserves and could win a large following I can imagine the situation being similar elsewhere if it is shown at all I think word of mouth could build this film into at least an art house success in the U S If anybody wants to post or e mail how it has done in Canada and or whether it has been distributed in Europe I would be interested One final word the film was financed in part by Telefilm Canada and The Ontario Film Development Corp one more sign of the superior civilization in Canada
0960,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,1990,Written and Directed by Tom Stoppard Cast Tim Roth Gary Oldman Richard Dreyfuss What we have here is a case of an excellent adaptation of a brilliant stage play Tom Stoppard has done a fabulous job of both adapting and directing his play for the screen I believe this is Stoppard s directorial debut at least in film although his screenwriting credits include BRAZIL as well as screen adaptations of J G Ballard s EMPIRE OF THE SUN and John LeCarre s THE RUSSIA HOUSE For those of you unfamiliar with R G think back to Shakespeare s HAMLET Remember those two guys who hang around with him for a little while and then are gone Those are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Minor characters in Shakespeare s play Now imagine this Watching HAMLET through the eyes of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern This is what R G ARE DEAD is all about having HAMLET happen around the bewildered and confused R G To be glib R G ARE DEAD can be described as an intellectual Who s On First Indeed there is much verbal fencing and witty dialogue that I almost would recommend that those unfamiliar with the text rent it first or read the play so as not to miss a lot of the texture I m not going to dwell upon plot anymore because I ve said all I m going to say about it That s the general outline and to say any more would be a foul and hideous deed indeed Another thing that makes R G ARE DEAD a real treat are the performances of Tim Roth last seen in Robert Altman s not so good VINCENT AND THEO and Gary Oldman STATE OF GRACE etc as the befuddled bewildered duo They pull of their roles with grace savoir faire and charm seemingly effortlessly portraying R G Definitely tour de force performances with few histrionics and with much subtlety This is what I believe makes R G ARE DEAD a superior adaptation the fact that subtlety comes across much easier on film than on the stage A subtle facial expression which may not make a great impact on stage due to the scale can make all the difference in a film and it does here There are times when both Roth and Oldman make a scene so funny just by a slight change in facial expression Richard Dreyfuss is also wonderful as the Player the leader of a travelling theatre troupe that plays at Elsinore Tom Stoppard does a fabulous job of directing as well He has created an Elsinore like no other Elsinore to quote another review an Elsinore by way of M C Escher Don t take it literally but Stoppard s Elsinore is a wild and wacky place He has made some textual changes to accommodate the transition from stage to screen and I believe added some material The sight gags are plentiful enough and a sight to behold neither staid nor cliche but fresh and witty
0961,Hamlet,1990,Two Shakespeare plays translated to film in one year is my idea of a good year I liked HENRY V despite the staginess and some of other cavils Likewise I liked HAMLET with reservations Now I know the movie and opera world divides pretty neatly into those who like Franco Zeffirelli s work and those who abominate him and it Likewise the world of Shakespeare divides into purists who sanctify the full and complete received texts and those who don t mind having a bit a fun here and there and aren t above playing fast and loose with the Master Zeffirelli s HAMLET is no more Shakespeare s HAMLET than his ROMEO AND JULIET or his TRAVIATA was anybody s but his own What I like about his work is that he understands the difference between a play and a movie His HAMLET is absolutely positively a movie and not a filmed play And movies always muck about with the source material very much as Shakespeare mucked about with his source material Even in the titles it doesn t say Shakespeare s Hamlet it says quite honestly Based on the play by William Shakespeare Zeffirelli has excised scenes moved scenes around relocated scenes Almost every fan of Shakespeare s HAMLET will find a favorite scene missing or altered There is even added material such as the executions of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and the death of Ophelia These edits seem to me to be fully justified in the name of making a movie out of a play Of course most of us will agree that Zeffirelli has a vast and dramatic visual sense whether or not we can agree that he always uses that visual sense with the best of taste He uses locales sets and costumes with exuberance and care And it makes this movie like his others visual feasts He also shoots many of his scenes en plein air others indoors in something like available light His camera is busy perhaps busier than is strictly necessary or desirable but that may be preferable to long static shots of actors declaiming no names please Another thing to like about Zeffirelli s HAMLET is the diction of the actors They speak their parts more naturally less hurriedly and swallow less of the words than is the general rule with Shakespearean productions Without a doubt I understand HAMLET better now that I ve seen Zeffirelli s version I ve studied it in school and seen live and filmed versions but I missed not being a great Shakespearean scholar even in my grad school days some basic structural details that came through loud and clear this time for the first time Par exemple just as the play within the play mirrors the major action so too does Laertes mirror Hamlet and his situation when he lets Claudius manipulate him into killing Hamlet but with the telling difference that Laertes never questions Claudius s honesty or motives and proceeds without scruples to do his treachery Probably everyone else in the civilized world knew all about this to me it came as a revelation while watching the final scene in the movie And there are some fine actors in this movie I don t have the cast list in front of me so rather than bollix the actors names as is my wont let me just say that the Ghost Polonius Laertes and Guildenstern Rosencrantz one of whom was almost certainly a Maloney by the way were all first rate the Polonius was especially fine in my humble opinion balancing comedy and an underlying seriousness with great deftness and precision And the Ghost made the most of his small role with some fine physical shtick especially one gesture where he covers half his face by fanning it with a kind of broken wrist movement as he tells Hamlet he is forbidden to speak of the afterlife a gem of acting I was almost as impressed by the acting of the name stars Helena Bonham Carter Glenn Close and Mel Gibson in descending order of impressiveness Bonham Carter brought a knowing strength to Ophelia that I ve seldom seen her mad scene was disturbing and pathetic Close looked marvelous and her scene with her son that ends with a hint of incest was strong and moving it had me in tears Gibson a Shakespearean dark horse if ever there were one was surprisingly good in most of his scenes with other actors the art of the soliloquy however has eluded him so far He moves well brings a brooding energy to his part and did not embarrass There were times though when I feared his eyes would pop right out of his head which is distracting at the least And I have to say that he was too old for the part at least as I envision Hamlet the young scholar prince Part of Gibson s trouble with the soliloquies perhaps derives from Zeffirelli s direction The movie has tendency to pause and almost clear its throat before launching into a famous speech at times the quotation marks were nearly visible I think any director has to work very hard to overcome the Barlett s Familiar Quotations aspect of HAMLET Too often I felt Zeffirelli instead of downplaying this distracting aspect was playing it up as if he had just realized Oh that s were that comes from Overall despite its shortcomings I don t think you can regret going to Zeffirelli s HAMLET
0962,Johanna DArc of Mongolia,1988,Synopsis Seven Western women are travelling on the Trans Siberian railroad when their train is hijacked by female Mongolian warriors The Western women are taken as hostages and kept in a Mongolian village Although the premise of the film is interesting it is not an adventure story Instead it is more of a travelogue and culture study and is fairly boring West Germany English subtitles color 1989 165 minutes Director Writer Ulrike Ottinger The plot of the film is relatively low key It begins on the Trans Siberian railroad where four travellers all women meet and get acquainted Two are middle aged an English anthropologist and a German schoolteacher Two are young an American actress and Johanna a young woman who is travelling light backpack only The women meet an amusing American man an effeminate Yiddish opera singer who is a glutton and describes his meals using extremely beautiful poetic language Also on board is a singing group the Kalinka sisters While crossing Mongolia the train is stopped by a group of female Mongolian warriors The Western women the 4 travellers plus the 3 Kalinka sisters are taken as hostages and moved to an all female Mongolian village The story continues with the cultural confrontations that result when the Westerners experience Mongolian culture and traditions I saw this movie because a brief review of it published in a film festival program guide described it as a lesbian LAWRENCE OF ARABIA Because of this comparison I expected the film to be an epic adventure with a big budget The reality is that the film is a very low budget travelogue The film has a very thin plot that serves as filler between scenes of traditional Mongolian culture and the countryside The primary focus of the film is cultural interaction A pamphlet available in the theater lobby included an interview with the Director and in the interview she specifically states that the focus of the film is not exotica i e Mongolia as an exotic culture but the interaction of cultures that are substantially different I would prefer to quote the interview directly but have lost the pamphlet The comparison of the film to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA may be reasonable or not depending on what you consider LAWRENCE to be an adventure film a travelogue or a film on cultural interaction The very low budget and low production values of JOHANNA are not even close to the high standards of LAWRENCE The film does provide a view into Mongolia an isolated country that is rarely visited by Westerners However in order to experience the travelogue portion one must endure roughly 1 5 hours of slow weak plot development At 2 hrs 45 min the movie is much too long Because of the weak nearly non existent plot I would not recommend the film to a general audience Those with a strong interest in Mongolia might find the film worthy of consideration
0963,Nikita,1990,Synopsis Nikita a violent young woman with a drug problem is sent to prison There she is recruited by an unnamed French intelligence agency and given a new life and a new job as an assassin for the French government A violent drama that varies from unbelievable to gripping Overall a very good movie France English subtitles color 1990 approx 118 minutes Director Writer Luc Besson Nikita is a 19 year old woman with serious problems She is a junkie and a thief One day she and her friends are robbing a drugstore to get drugs Things go wrong the police arrive and a bloody shootout follows The ultimate result of this is that Nikita ends up in prison serving a life sentence Nikita is deliberately given a drug overdose by prison officials and she officially dies Nikita awakens from her death to find she is being held by French Intelligence officials She has a choice work for the government as an assassin or go back to her grave this time for good This begins Nikita s new life working for the government After a lengthy training period the story continues as Nikita is returned to the outside world to begin her work as a killer but is she actually ready for life on the outside again Can she have a personal life while working as an assassin Given the storyline of the film I was concerned that it might turn into a woman exploited by big bad guys story Although you do have some sympathy for Nikita by the end of the picture you won t forget her depiction from the first part of the picture a hateful drug addicted young woman who is prone to acts of uncontrollable extreme violence and who kills without hesitation The film does not glamorize or victimize Nikita Instead Nikita is the victim of her own violent actions and her own wrong choices in life The production values of the film are high and some of the acting is very good The actress who portrays Nikita Anne Parillaud is excellent However some of the things that happen in the film seem rather unbelievable For example the way some of the covert activities are accomplished is dubious one would think that an assassination for political purposes would be thoroughly planned to avoid risk of discovery and would not have any last minute uncertainties These complaints are minor however and do not distract from the action or enjoyment of the film Overall I thought the film was very good certainly worth considering because of its interesting story line and the fact that it does not glamorize Nikita One caution the film is very violent Distribution Scheduled to open Friday 4 5 in San Francisco AMC Kabuki 8 Cinema in its first U S release U S distributor The Samuel Goldwyn Company
0964,Sleeping with the Enemy,1991,Let s face it I saw this film just to see Julia Roberts With that out of the way the film can be criticized SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY can only be called derivative I can t think of any other word that so accurately describes it After the first twenty minutes which I found tense and intense the film became highly predictable There were some moments of nice camera use not enough to help The dialog was very spotty ranging down to the absurd in a couple of scenes In one scene Roberts sits down to a meal and has a conversation with the enemy that almost makes the film laughable There are some Hitchcock like elements in the film but it covers only one bit of territory Alfred didn t domestic violence actually at times it seems as though the production is ripping off Brian DePalma who ripped off Hitchcock I found myself thinking back to STRANGERS ON A TRAIN at one point VERTIGO at another and in each thinking how I would ve rather seen those fine films again than this one the first time Actually I knew once I heard Robert s name in the film Laura what was in store My rating would be an even 0 on the 4 to 4 scale Immediately after watching it my rating would have been a generous 1 but with reflection this movie can t even carry that rating
0965,Ten to Chi to,1990,HEAVEN AND EARTH is a Japanese costume drama by Haruki Kadokawa who is inter alia a Shinto priest The story pits two feudal warlords against each other one young spiritual dedicated to preserving his domain the other older materialistic ambitious to conquer all Japan and be the next shogun In a sense HEAVEN AND EARTH is organized like a traditional epic such as the Iliad or the Bhagavad Gita in that it begins in medias res and concludes inconclusively focusing on battles as physical manifestations of spiritual struggles But for the modern Western viewer it s merely inconclusive The stars of the film are the costume designer the cinematographer and the horse wranglers I went to the film for the spectacle the color and the texture and so was not disappointed As a dramatic vehicle it is pretty weak at least to an American viewer Two hours of a grim faced silent men staring relentlessly into the infinite makes it pretty hard for your humble reviewer to learn anything about character development When people change they just do it without much motivation or preparation When characters die they just die and it hardly seems important whether it was disease or suicide But this is not to say the film is not interesting or worth seeing It is eye filling The costumes are positively stunning The scenery magnificent even though most of the exteriors were shot in Alberta Rich saturated colors almost as painterly as early Technicolor visual drama in every shot There is a sequence in cherry blossom time that is not to be believed There is narration by Stuart Whitman to get us up to speed with the historical events otherwise the events would be nearly inaccessible to a Westerner This part of Japanese history may or may not be well known in Japan but the Battle of Kawanakajima is nothing I know anything about Apparently research was a major budget item here with authentic restagings of the battles attention to traditional strategy and a simulation of actual troop movement Not being a military history buff myself what I saw a the amazing spectacle of thousands of men in red and black armor even more thousands of flags and banners The influence of Kurasawa and especially RAN is pretty obvious and ironic in its way This movie cost 42 million dollars every one of which is visible on the screen whereas Kurosawa has to go overseas to fund his masterpieces and has not been liked in his homeland for decades HEAVEN AND EARTH is a pretty picture but it is not a great movie However I can recommend it with reservations to at least the Japanophiles amongst us
0966,Career Opportunities,1991,CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Starring Frank Whaley Jennifer Connelly and Dermot Mulroney Written and Produced by John Hughes Directed by Bryan Gordon CAREER OPPORTUNITIES is a story about a 21 year old who really hasn t done anything with his life he is also not liked very much around town It is also about a girl who is very unhappy with her home life and wants very much to escape They find themselves one night locked inside of a Target store they get to talking and consider whether or not they should just run off out of town to L A These are basically the highlights of the film it does not elaborate on them much further the rest is mostly antics This movie could have been a first draft script for HOME ALONE that got rewritten by John Hughes thrown out and then revitalized somehow by Bryan Gordon Gordon probably figured that since this script was written by Hughes it was sure to be a hit He got Hughes to produce it and figured he couldn t go wrong Well I m sorry to say I think he did anyway CAREER OPPORTUNITIES is a movie full of overpowering rock music sensational film credits and very little plot and or character development This film has an interesting premise but I believe it was underexecuted by Gordon and his crew This film is advertised under the following headings A new comedy from John Hughes creator of HOME ALONE He took the job that no one wanted and got the girl that everyone did and Maximum comedy at minimum wage Unfortunately this movie lives up to none of these tag lines It s not much of a comedy it doesn t even have it s moments There are only one or two funny lines and only one or two funny sight gags The two hoods in this movie gave me the impression that they were the prototyype characters for the two hoods in HOME ALONE which makes me believe even more that this script was a preliminary throw out version of HOME ALONE and even they are not convincing This movie doesn t even live up to it s name It seems the biggest star of this movie is Hughes rather than Connelly or Whaley Frank Whaley is not very convincing as Jim Dodge the Town Liar who seems to be a rip off of Ferris Bueller Second Jennifer Connelly s looks are perfect for the character she plays but she fails to display any real depth I think that if this film had been cast better the characters might have been more convincing and I stress might There is nothing in this movie that does real justice to Connelly s acting talents and I know she s got talent I ve seen it it just hasn t been tapped by any of her roles the closest would have to be SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN and I don t remember if I have seen Frank Whaley anywhere before If I have he didn t make much of an impression on me Connelly however did and I hate to see her so poorly used For the purposes of this movie Connelly was merely beautiful and Whaley was merely a wisecracker I am basing this review on the previous films spawned by John Hughes Even though HOME ALONE is getting lukewarm reviews from the critics I believe the basic appeal of the movie is that it is pure fun it s like a big Looney Tunes cartoon in flesh and blood and it embodies everything you go to the movies for On the other hand we have the Hughes fan s all time favorite THE BREAKFAST CLUB where the characters do have fun but they also display some depth and substance A good example of a combination of the two is FERRIS BUELLER S DAY OFF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES emulates only ghosts of these things I think the basic problem with CAREER OPPORTUNITIES is that it was not directed by Hughes I believe that when he does not direct the scripts he writes the results are lukewarm with the granted exception of HOME ALONE One movie that exemplifies what I mean is SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL It was not a bad film it was better than this one but I think it could have been better under Hughes tutelage The majority of Hughes films have some kind of sentimentality in them and I mean that in the best way even among those which upon first glance you wouldn t expect to have any such as PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES I m afraid CAREER OPPORTUNITIES just doesn t deliver what a Hughes fan would normally expect in a Hughes movie After all Hughes is the most advertised name of this movie There is a small attempt to furnish the characters with some traits normal to the Hughes characters like people who are frustrated with their lives and just want to break out of the routine but Gordon just doesn t do justice to what might have been a entertaining movie again stressing might The movie is formulaic which is in my opinion what sours the film It seems that Gordon believes that if you put enough rock music and beautiful people in a movie it doesn t matter if it doesn t have a plot That s exactly what kills this movie It lacks feeling A good telling of a John Hughes story is one where the music is right the actors play the parts right and it leaves you dare I say fulfilled That s part of Hughes appeal This one left me unfulfilled Maybe I should say shame on him for letting this movie slide by Unless you re a die hard Jennifer Connelly fan I would not recommend seeing this movie This is a movie that might have been but just doesn t deliver what it should The Hughes fan has higher expectations than he she had before and this film does not live up to those expectations It s too bad the actors can t see the finished film before it comes out I m sure they all did it in good faith
0967,Warlock,1989,Surprise of surprises WARLOCK was actually released to a paying audience in New York City the place the Phantom calls home This caught the Phantom somewhat off guard as he expected that WARLOCK would suffer a fate similar to that of BRIDE OF REANIMATOR which is even now shocking unsuspecting parents of the twelve year olds who are renting it in droves from Blockbusters across the country The long awaited sequel to the cult classic REANIMATOR got either no theatrical release or such a limited run that it made no difference for all intents and purposes the film went straight from the mind of Stuart Gorden to a half dozen video duplicators across the country Such things depress the Phantom for he knows that there is a market for horror out there if only the independent production companies responsible for most of it could muscle their way into our increasingly monopolized theater chains Getting an independent film into movie houses is no mean feat these days even or perhaps especially in New York which has been neatly divvied up by MCA Universal on one hand and Loews Paramount on the other These days some films are playing everywhere and some almost nowhere and never does it have anything to do with the quality or type of film just the distributor WARLOCK s story is slightly different it was one of the last few films still on the shelf at New World Pictures when that B movie powerhouse found that all its low grossing schlock had come back to haunt it straight into Chapter 11 proceedings Even two hit television series The Wonder Years and Tour of Duty couldn t save it and when the lawyers had finally finished picking over its corpse there was WARLOCK still in the can It appears that rather than let it go completely to waste some small and limited distribution was made overseas the Phantom believes that it may have had its world premiere in Australia of all places followed quickly by an equally brief showing stateside As the lights dimmed and the film began the Phantom was pleased to note the many scratches and splices that this New York premiere copy of the print already contained Sadly that print had seen more states more countries and the insides of more theater auditoriums than the Phantom is ever likely to see in his lifetime THE PUNISHER WARLOCK s brother on the shelf at New World when the debt hit the fan is likely to suffer a similar fate both films were advertised in in theater previews two years ago and it s only now that WARLOCK is seeing the light of day The Phantom is still rather eagerly awaiting the estimable Mr Dolph Lundgren in his near Shakespearean sure to be remembered at Oscar time performance That said the Phantom should move on to the film itself which turned out to be quite enjoyable in a low key low rent sort of way Directed by Steve Miner WARLOCK feels very much like Miner s 1986 horror comedy HOUSE which turned out to be a surprise box office hit It was a film that blended just enough laughs with just enough scares and offered little to offend anyone Audiences responded well to its style and pacing which resembled nothing so much as an extended episode of Tales from the Darkside It was in a way the ARACHNOPHOBIA of its time though unlike ARACHNOPHOBIA people actually went to see HOUSE WARLOCK tells the story of an upwardly mobile demon who travels through space and time in search of each of the pieces of the Devil s Bible which in the film is referred to very gravely as The Grand Grim Something Or Other the Phantom can t quite remember though everyone had very serious expressions on their faces when they said it This anti Bible when reassembled would also show the true name of God which if spoken backward will cause all of existence to be uncreated a sure way to end the film if there ever was one so it pretty much guarantees that nothing of the sort will happen for at least 90 minutes For reassembling the Bible the Warlock would be rewarded by meeting the Cursed One himself or by becoming his servant or his chauffeur or personal assistant or something of that nature In any case it was a definite career advancement for this very 80 s style warlock On second thought perhaps the Warlock wanted to be more downwardly mobile than upwardly mobile With long blonde pony tail custom all black tailoring and a profile that looks like it came straight out of an Armani ad Julian Sands plays a very charming demon But trailing him out of the past in reverse TERMINATOR style is a certified good guy to borrow a phrase from Chuckie named Redferne who is bent on avenging the death of his sweetheart And has been so for centuries Talk about grudges Redferne had last tangled with the Warlock in the film s opening scenes set in late 17th century Massachusetts and it was only by the narrowest of margins that the Warlock escaped public execution Curiously he was sentenced to be hung and then burned over a basket of live cats The Phantom isn t sure what effect this last part of the sentence is supposed to have had perhaps baskets of live cats were used regularly as part of the complex criminal justice system of the late 17th century but as our Constitution now clearly prohibits allowing cats anywhere near a public execution the Phantom suspects that such a sentence will come as quite a shock to some of the more liberal members of the audience Frankly the Phantom would consider even 100 hours of community service with a basket full of live cats to be cruel and inhuman punishment and so he was once again reminded of just how lucky he is to be living in these more enlightened times Both the Warlock and Redferne pop up in late 80 s Los Angeles which seems less of a shock to the Warlock than it does to Redferne who arrives and remains dressed somewhat peculiarly in furs as if he had last been tracking the Warlock through 17th century Montana rather than pre colonial Boston One of the film s small in jokes is that neither the Warlock nor Redferne attract much attention in L A Also on hand is our heroine Kassandra with a K who makes the mistake of letting the Warlock get away with one of her personal objects as it happens one of her cheap plastic bracelets is all he needs to cast a devilish hex on her This gives Kassandra some personal incentive beyond just the saving all of existence to help Redferne stop the Warlock from completing his task and getting that corner office in Hell The film focuses almost exclusively on the chase and this is just as well since it keeps the bogus Catholic theology to a minimum and the plot humming along Other recent bogus Catholic theology horror films have fared both better and worse THE EXORCIST III was a far superior film but it took itself very seriously and was excessively stagey at times On the other hand no one apparently least of all the filmmakers took THE FIRST POWER very seriously and in addition it spent far too much time attempting to explain things and far too little time on acting lessons for Tracy Griffith for it to have been much good THE FIRST POWER was a terrible film but in many ways it stands as the best homage ever made to one of the worst horror or mainstream films of all time EXORCIST II THE HERETIC a film that featured nothing but pseudo Catholic theology and fabulously bad acting WARLOCK by way of contrast uses the Warlock s quest for the Grim Whatever as the means to a very ordinary ends a 60 minute chase with the requisite fight to the death before the closing credits fortunately for us it spares only the briefest of moments on all the theological mumbo jumbo In a sense WARLOCK could be considered the HARD TO KILL of horror films and with his excess of charm and male model good looks it s easy to think of the Warlock as the Steven Seagal of demons Julian Sands plays the Warlock like Steven Seagal plays well Steven Seagal and the Phantom could never shake the thought that at any moment the Warlock was going to take on a gang of bikers in a billiards parlor swinging a pool cue in lethal fashion while keeping one eye on himself in the mirror over the bar However although the Warlock does engage in some gratuitous acts of violence early on he soon limits himself to scuffling with old Mennonite farmers and threatening meek looking priests Things proceed pretty much as you might expect WARLOCK is a film that holds few surprises other than the timing and placement of a few assorted Spring Loaded Cats but the film doesn t really suffer for being completely predictable any more than did THE TERMINATOR on which it is quite obviously based WARLOCK also adds a dash of WITNESS and a pinch of THE OMEN just to keep from being too bland Instead its predictability and good humor are its assets and account for much of the film s considerable charm As with HOUSE there is little for all but the most severe critic to find fault with it is a film that s much too easy going to dislike On the other hand neither is it a film that will be much remembered in a few months like a good episode of Tales from the Darkside one might think of it fondly for a week or two and then let it fade painlessly from memory Unlike Tales from the Darkside however WARLOCK will be back to remind us all of its existence in a few months when it reincarnates itself as a video release in Blockbusters nationwide Among the film s high points are the acting which is as good as it gets in this sort of film though the Warlock s first victim could give even Tracy Griffith a run for the worst actor of the nineties and the dialogue which is unusually witty especially when either the Warlock or Redferne is uttering an oath of some sort Redferne s Scottish accent is a tad bizarre and he says Tarry not a lot but his speech and dialogue play off well against Kassandra s beach bimbo L A chatter There are continuity errors aplenty starting not even 10 seconds into the film with a pay telephone that rings as its receiver hangs at the end of its cord but the plot has no gaping holes and at least attempts to make sense when it needs to And although the special effects sometimes seem to have been salvaged from POLTERGEIST s cutting room floor they are mostly adequate and occasionally first rate As an added bonus the editing is quite good and the music by Jerry Goldsmith is better than it has any right to be To be honest WARLOCK isn t really worth seeing in the theaters even if you can find a theater in which to see it Better to wait a month or two and then check the recent release section at Blockbusters The film s easy going nature and general good humor will play just as well at home as it does in the theater and the popcorn is free All in all WARLOCK is not by any means a great horror film but it s entertaining and diverting and the Phantom recommends that you give it a try especially if you re looking for something a little lighter than the standard horror fare
0968,Comfort of Strangers The,1990,THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS is a new film by Paul Schraeder dir PATTY HEARST screenwriter TAXI DRIVER among others Schraeder s films are usually descents into a world where the viewer s moral and social assumptions are constantly called into question They re explorations of the nature of hell THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS unfolds similarly A nice young English couple Natasha Richardson and an English actor whose name I can t recall who plays her boyfriend visit a decadent Venice trying to determine the future course of their relationship They ve been seeing each other for a number of years and she wants to get married he s not sure One evening lost while looking for a late night meal they encounter Robert Christopher Walken a very refined upper class Italian gentleman the son of a diplomat Robert is somewhat slimy but the couple is hungry it s late and the force of Robert s personality is such that they have no choice but to follow him to a local bar where Robert spends most of the time talking about himself This not so pleasant evening ends but the English couple is not yet through with Robert or his Canadian wife Helen Mirren The older couple has plans for them and you just know if s going to end badly for somebody but there seems to be no choice for the English couple a common problem for Schraeder protagonists The problem with the story is that the entanglement of the English couple with Robert and his wife doesn t seem so much predetermined or inevitable as forced on them by the filmmaker There seem to be plenty of opportunities to distance themselves from the unpleasant Robert even for such a determinedly nice and polite couple as the English When Travis Bickle shoots up the whorehouse in TAXI DRIVER you just know it had to happen everything led up to that point Here however we have more questions than answers Why doesn t the young couple avoid Robert Why does their contact with Robert supercharge their lovemaking Why does Robert hold the views and tastes that he does and why does his wife help him I felt unsatisfied at the end Some of the fault must lie with Harold Pinter the screenwriter who adapted the screenplay from a novel although someone with as strong screenwriting talent as Schraeder must be held responsible too The production itself is fine Schraeder films Venice in beautiful rich colors most of the outside scenes take place in the evening or at twilight and Venice looks entirely and appropriately menacing an accomplice in what follows The English couple is inoffensive but sympathetic Walken is loathsome in a way that s hard to put one s finger on but it s very well done and Mirren is good as his wife with her own menace but her part is less weighty than it might have been If the screenplay were more motivated I could recommend this film as it is it seemed overlong and was disappointing
0969,Iron & Silk,1990,I was very much looking forward to this filmed version of Mark Salzman s book on his experiences as an English teacher in China I must admit that I ve never read the book although a friend of mine who had was enthusiastic about it but I did once see him read from the book in person at the Black Oak Bookstore in Berkeley where he also did some of his kung fu routines and I knew a woman who knew Salzman and had been in China on the same Yale program as Salzman and was a witness to some of the events described in the book although she and Salzman s other American colleagues had generally been written out of the book and the film Salzman who is an engaging personality in person insisted on starring as himself in the film version he also seems to be something of a self promoter and I was curious to see what he would do with it The result in my brother s words he also saw the film was insipid Salzman comes off engagingly Some of the reviews called him a bad actor but I think he was just fine The problem is in the story There s no conflict no tension At least none that seems to matter There s no sense of any real failures that he experiences no feeling for the difficulties he must have had teaching English to a class of middle aged Chinese teachers who had been told to forget their Russian and learn English not even any feeling for the efforts he must have gone through to become the kung fu expert that he became although he must have worked very hard We have no idea of how or even whether Salzman has grown at all over his two years in China He comes into the country fully well adjusted and we never feel that he ever had occasion to call any of his beliefs into question What s good about the film Well Salzman himself isn t bad and the man who plays the head Chinese teacher is a rather interesting and ambiguous characher of whom I would have liked to see more Salzman s kung fu teacher who was also his kung fu teacher in real life he plays himself has a fun part although he s played as a crusty guy with a heart of gold it would have been interesting to get into his head a little more The kung fu practice scenes are interleaved with scenes from the old kung fu movies that Salzman thrived on as a kid it s a witty touch The photography is also good and there s one sequence where Salzman visits a boat dwelling family that s breathtaking I wish there were more scenes like that in the film
0970,Defending Your Life,1991,Capsule review Find out where Southern Californians go when they die Albert Brooks s life after death comedy is charming and fun but sidesteps substance Rating low 1 Albert Brooks writes directs and stars in subtle little comedies about human foibles He has a good feel for small characters and a good ear for dialogue His MODERN ROMANCE has him wooing a beautiful woman with whom he is unable to get along His LOST IN AMERICA has him quitting a good job in a fit of pique and then going out in an RV to discover a real America that is not what he thought it was Each gives a hint what he thinks life is about but it is open to some interpretation In DEFENDING YOUR LIFE he turns to fantasy so instead of hinting he can come right out and state his values A Brooksian character Daniel dies on his birthday and finds himself in a very Californian view of an afterlife In Judgment City he is given a hearing to defend his life and the way that he has led it At stake is whether he will attain a higher plane in the next life or not Rather than just hint at his values the way Brooks as screenwriter did in previous films he now can posit a heavenly host who can say This is the standard by which you will be judged And his standard comes down to Be brave If you do not insist on the salary you think you deserve if you do not take a chance on your investments if you do not have sex with someone when you want it it will be held against you in Brooks s afterlife Ethics count for nothing Helping others if not done in a spectacular feat of courage counts for nothing Courage is what counts What could have been a view into Brooks s personal philosophy suffers greatly from the apparent shallowness of that philosophy At heart then the film misses a chance to be about something profound and instead is just another film like L A STORY and SCENES FROM A MALL about California values This particular vision of Limbo adjusted for Californians is a vision of what Brooks thinks his contemporaries would like in an afterlife It is garish hotels and gourmet food You can eat as much as you like without worrying about calories cholesterol or capacity During the day you have hearings on your integrity as a person then at night you can go hear a comic or see what you were in previous lives in a sort of upscale convention center Brooks s character meets and falls in love with the perfect woman Julia played by Meryl Streep She is easy going and affable and was a hero in her previous life Julia is not so much a woman as a walking good example She is sailing through judgment while Daniel is having serious problems with a strident prosecutor played by Lee Grant and an enigmatic and strange attorney played by Rip Torn DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is diverting but the ending is weak and the philosophy is shallow I rate it a low 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0971,Defending Your Life,1991,Albert Brooks is at it again making another movie about one man s quest to redeem himself Brooks directed acted and starred in Defending Your Life the very funny story of a man defending his life after his death Brooks is a Muppie Middle aged Urban Professional what happens to Yuppies after 35 who is clearly beloved by his coworkers But on his 39th birthday Daniel Brooks absent mindedly crashes his new BMW convertible into a bus and finds himself someplace else The someplace else is Judgement City and it s a place people go after they die At first Daniel is just dazed and meekly does whatever he is told Judgement City is a wonderful creation and Brooks deserves loads of credit for creating the most amusing afterlife since BEETLEJUICE This is the afterlife as if the US government created it everything is very orderly there are lots of glass towers you can eat anything you want and never gain weight and people who behaved very well in their lives get the best accommodations Daniel for example winds up in a place that s a lot like a Holiday Inn Daniel is instructed to go to meet his lawyer Mr Diamond The purpose of a stay in Judgement City is to see if you are ready to go onto the next stage or if you need to return to Earth to conquer your fears by living another life He has to watch himself from nine different days in his life and defend his actions These scenes show him to be basically well meaning yet fearful When he isn t defending himself Daniel discovers a woman Julia wonderfully played by Meryl Streep Julia is a very sweet vivacious woman for someone recently dead She and Daniel take to each other right away after all they are some of the few young people there It s clear that Julia is destined for the next stage and that Daniel no matter how good his intentions is destined to return to Earth to try again Here s a spoiler only if you ve never seen a commercial or trailer for the film The ending is shown in every commercial and trailer ever shown for this movie This was a mistake This movie is very sweet and good natured and very funny However aside from Brooks and Streep the other performances were aggravatingly muted Jim my husband wished Robert Preston was alive to play Mr Diamond because Rip Torn gave an annoying two note sort of performance Likewise Lee Grant was utterly colorless as the prosecuting attorney While there is much amusing in this movie and I do recommend it because the leads are so strong Brooks belabors a few jokes The eating all you want comments got to be a bit much along with the small brain jokes I rate it a 7 on the Chuck scale Oh members of the Gaffe Squad will notice a minor one when Daniel and Diamond are eating lunch I already sent a note about it to PREMIERE magazine
0972,Silence of the Lambs The,1991,Jonathan Demme creates a horrifying and gruesome story of two serial killers One is an imprisoned and demented psychiatrist Hannibal the cannibal Lecter and the other is a serial killer on the loose Buffalo Bill Lecter is visited in his maximum security cell by a young FBI agent in training Clarisse played by Jodie Foster Clarisse had been sent by her boss and trainer played by Scott Glenn Lecter was jailed for committing heinous crimes including cannibalism hence the nickname Clarisse s objective is to retrieve information from a psychopath like Lecter in order catch Buffalo Bill Lecter is helpful at first But Clarisse is dealing with a highly intelligent and clever criminal On the other hand Buffalo Bill is a serial killer who skins his victims He kidnaps the daughter of a senator in West Virginia The minute the news hits the FBI agency in Washington DC Clarisse offers a vacation plan to Lecter as a supposed bribe The chase for Buffalo Bill goes on from here Meanwhile problems occur with Lecter after he is transferred to a temporary cell ordered by his officer in charge There are some explicit scenes of victims and of extreme violence in this film The film lets us look into the mind of a serial killer There are many surprises and a heart pounding ending in this well executed and mind numbing movie The cinematography and music help set the dark mood Anthony Hopkins performs Hannibal Lecter to the hilt It is the best acting performance of 1991 so far Hopkins should be a shoo in for a nomination for next year s Oscar awards Jodie Foster does a competent job as a FBI agent who learns very quickly how dangerous her job can be Overall Silence of the Lambs is definately one of the best thrillers in a few years
0973,Bashu,1989,Last night I saw a film called BASHU THE LITTLE STRANGER in San Francisco It is a film made in Iran The San Francisco Chronicle had a review of it last week end It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time BASHU is a fantastically directed and acted dramatic movie about a ten year old Iranian boy who lost his family in southern Iran during the war His village was bombed He sneaks into the back of a truck to get out of the war area Traveling north he ends up in the beautifully green areas of the northern Iran by the Caspian Sea where he faces suspicious villagers who distrust him because of his dark face and southern dialect A young woman villager takes him in and the story begins The story is great The cinematography is fantastic Bashu was played superbly What is interesting that I noticed is that even though the movie did not have a haunting score the rare occasions of audio percussion were quite moving Also in the Thirty fourth San Francisco International Film Festival there will be another Iranian movie called CLOSE UP NAMA YE NAZDIK Here is an article from the San Francisco Film Society publication
0974,Eating,1990,Director Henry Jaglom s new film EATING has the voyeuristic attraction of spying on a group therapy session On the surface the scene of this film is a large birthday party in where else southern California where 38 women gather to celebrate the birthdays of Helene turning 40 Kate 30 and Sadie 50 However much of the film centers on the deeply personal revelations of these women concerning their problems with food men and body image As the film progresses we see more and more how the various problems of these apparently independent and successful women express themselves in an obsession with food thinness and dieting One of these women is Martine a French television documentary maker played convincingly by Nelly Allard Martine is ostensibly producing a documentary about Southern California lifestyles but her work actually centers on women and food This play within a play mechanism is contrived but it produces some of the most memorable moments of the film EATING is sprinkled with short cutaways and collages from this woman s videocamera as the women at the party describe the formative moments of their relationship with food I will not try to list all of the notable performances in this film since every one of the actresses even the nameless bit players has her moment of revelation many in front of Martine s videocamera Director Henry Jaglom obviously establishes a rapport with these women and the portrayals come across as absolutely authentic I will however single out two performances Gwen Welles plays the neurotic and unsympathetic Sophie whose jealousy of her successful and above all thin friends leads her to viciously attack and manipulate her closest friend Helene And Frances Bergen Candice s mother plays Helene s mother perhaps the only character who is not obsessed with food and who tries to confront various other characters with their neurotic behavior One memorable scene The cutting of the birthday cake where slices of birthday cake are passed endlessly around the room as if they were time bombs My favorite line I guess I m still looking for a man who will excite me as much as a baked potato While EATING does center on the topic of eating disorders it is completely unlike those preachy television docudramas which isolate specific problems in an otherwise Leave it To Beaver world EATING presents eating disorders with both humor and pathos as a symptom of the problems women face in affluent Western society I strongly recommend EATING to anyone who can put up with talky films In my opinion this may be the best film to hit the arthouse scene since JESUS OF MONTREAL
0975,Yume miruyoni nemuritai,1986,Synopsis In 1950s Japan the daughter of an aging silent film actress is kidnapped A young detective is hired to find and return the kidnapped young woman the trail leads to the Japanese subsidiary of M Pathe Co where the woman is trapped in a 1915 silent film A nearly silent film that interweaves reality and dreams so skillfully that they are indistinguishable A challenging but worthwhile film Japan English subtitles black and white 1986 81 minutes Director Writer Kaizo Hayashi This film is a tribute to Japanese silent films particularly the films made in the final phase of the silent film industry The story concerns an aging silent film actress who hires a young private detective to find and return her daughter Bellflower who has reportedly been kidnapped and is being held for ransom The detective is a strange fellow who sits around eating hard boiled eggs in huge quantities while he analyzes the ransom demand delivered via tape recording to hopefully find and return Bellflower The detective and his young assistant follow a long maze of clues to find Bellflower only to eventually learn that she is trapped in a 1915 silent film from M Pathe Co that has no ending From here the story continues with reality magic and dreams intermingling so seam lessly that it becomes impossible to determine what is reality and what is a dream In the synopsis I describe the film as challenging but worthwhile for a number of reasons First the film is completely silent except for some sound effects the taped messages from the kidnappers and a brief narration in one scene provided by a benshi a person who was hired by Japanese theaters in the silent days to read the dialog to the audience The challenge here is that modern audiences are used to sound and may find the silent medium less interesting Another challenge for some is the slow way the story builds At the screening 3 or 4 people from a rather small audience walked out before the film even reached the midpoint 40 minutes This may have been due in part to the slow pace of plot development However there are rewards for patience because the pace of the film increases just after the midpoint and the film becomes very interesting The film accomplishes something that is not very common in cinema the interleaving of relative reality and fantasy within a single story line in such a way that it is difficult to tell where the fantasy ends and reality begins Other films where this is done include THE PEDDLER an Iranian film I reviewed some months ago and the last parts of BRAZIL also TOTAL RECALL if you consider the controversy over whether the adventures really happened or were just a dream I recommend the film to fans of silent films and to those interested in a film that blends reality and dreams
0976,Baxter,1988,Synopsis The story of a dog a bull terrier who goes through a succession of owners in search of an authoritarian master A black comedy satire that explores the strange things that people do The film is thought provoking but not very entertaining France English subtitles color 1991 82 minutes Director Jerome Boivin The screenplay for this film was written by the Director and Jacques Audiard and is based on the novel Hell Hound by Ken Greenhall I haven t read the book so cannot comment on how the film relates to the book The film is the story of Baxter a dog a bull terrier Perhaps I should identify the bull terrier breed the dog in the beer ads Spuds McKenzie Party Animal is a bull terrier The story is told from Baxter s viewpoint with extra scenes added that Baxter does not appear in to complete the story Some scenes are shot from Baxter s point of view i e close to the ground The story is narrated by Baxter who relates his thoughts and plans The story begins as Baxter is taken from a breeding kennel and given to an old woman Baxter quickly tires of living with the old woman because he wants discipline he wants to obey and the old woman will not discipline him Baxter looks across the street at the young couple moving in their liveliness and strong smells excite him The old woman suffers from two mysterious accidents were they arranged by Baxter and Baxter is given to the young couple That arrangement does not last and Baxter is given to a new perhaps ideal owner a young teenage boy with a Nazi fetish The story continues as Baxter is disciplined by his new owner who constructs a replica of Hitler s bunker in the junkyard that he plays in The film has some black comedy in it and at times becomes a sharp satire on human relations and customs Unfortunately the film is not very entertaining there is not much humor Indeed one local newspaper mini review described it as a horror film in some ways it is However the film gives a rich insight into the personality of Baxter and the craziness of humanity There are layers of social commentary present in allegorical form to analyze Inasmuch as Baxter is searching for someone to obey his relationship with people can be seen as an allegory of the fatal attraction humanity has with totalitarianism An alternate view is that Baxter with his strong need to be controlled is the ideal citizen for whom social and political activists are only too happy to provide control Because the film is not very entertaining I would not suggest it to a general audience If you want a film to analyze for its layers of social comment it is worth considering Distribution Now in its first U S theatrical run Playing in the San Francisco area should be available in other areas also
0977,Warlock,1989,Capsule review Three years after the coming attractions ran WARLOCK is finally getting a release albeit spotty A prestigious producer a good director and a distinguished cast turn out a good drive in horror movie made with care and imagination The one flaw is a rather obvious borrowing from the plot of TERMINATOR Rating low 2 4 to 4 One of the odd mysteries of cinema of late has been whatever happened to WARLOCK Three years ago there were coming attractions that promised a horror film with a nice look From what we saw it could have been decent or it could have been another special effects and gore film But for three years it did not seem to get released either to theaters or to cassette Finally in 1991 the film is getting a spotty here and there release and while nothing great it is certainly closer to my best hopes than to my worst fears Only on reading material about the film afterwards do I discover that the film had a pedigree that should have raised my expectations perhaps to the point that I would have been disappointed when I actually saw the film It is produced by Arnold Kopelson who also produced PLATOON It is directed by Steve Miner whose HOUSE did have some good moments It stars Julian Sands of A ROOM WITH A VIEW and Richard Grant of WITHNAIL AND I The film has a very nice look It is clear this was not intended to be a film dominated by special effects There is a little gore about the amount you might find in a Hammer Films horror piece of the early 1960s Most of the other effects are nicely orchestrated and occasionally done with the subtlety to leave the viewer not quote sure what has just been seen The worst touch is that the basic plot is very similar to TERMINATOR The film opens near Boston Massachusetts in the year 1691 A rather unappealing witchfinder Giles Redferne played by Richard Grant has sentenced to death a rather charismatic sorcerer played by Julian Sands Our warlock escapes with a spell that catapults both him and the witchfinder into modern day Los Angeles There the warlock begins a mission to re unite three separated sections of the Devil s Grimoire When brought together they will tell the warlock God s most secret name This aspect sounds more as if it came from the Kaballah than from 17th Century European tradition Reciting that name backwards will uncreate the world which then presumably Satan can recreate by his rules The warlock kills one of the two housemates who care for him after a somewhat rocky arrival The other housemate he curses Each morning she will find herself aged twenty years over the day before This rapidly aging woman played by Lori Singer and the witchfinder set out to find and stop the warlock This is an oddly sexless film and that works in its favor The plot is never stopped nor is its mood sabotaged for gratuitous scenes of titillation Nor is the film padded out with long chase scenes The film is 102 minutes long because there was just about 102 minutes of story to tell Most of those 102 minutes show some imagination Don t get me wrong WARLOCK is a drive in sort of movie not great cinema It is not a ground breaker even as a horror film It is a drive in movie that delivers the goods just about every moment it is on the screen I give it a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0978,Nikita,1990,Director Luc Besson Producer Jerome Chalou Music by Eric Serra Starring Anne Parillaud Jean Hugues Anglade Tcheky Karyo Jeanne Moreau A French Italian co production 1990 French with English subtitles France s Luc Besson is well known for his films LE DERNIER COMBAT THE LAST BATTLE SUBWAY and THE BIG BLUE which are stylish and somewhat surreal However along with some other directors of similar stylish films such as Ridley Scott Kathryn Bigelow David Lynch and Michael Mann he sometimes has a problem with scripts that let down the images There tends to be a lack of substance which is illuminated by the contrast with the production values and attention to detail and imagery Does this film close the gap Besson s wife Anne Parillaud plays a teenage street punk called Nikita who is spaced out on drugs and in with a group that are equally spaced out and very violent They break into a chemist drugstore for Americans and are surprised in the act of stealing drugs by the owner and the police Basically everyone dies in a hail of bullets except Nikita who is dragged off to jail She is shown to be extremely violent and irrational which gets her life imprisonment The French secret service who knows which group it is supposed to be perhaps La Securite recruit her by staging her death then offering her either life as an assassin for France or a real death to fill the empty grave her family grieved over You can guess which she takes The rest of the story revolves around her training acceptance of her situation and finally after three years release into the world as a government sanctioned killer She comes out as a smart beautiful deadly woman who knows little of living in the real world Nevertheless with the aid of what has become her surrogate father her boss in the secret service and a man she eventually becomes engaged to she slowly fills in the gaps of compassion feeling and love However as she carries out her hits each mission gets more and more difficult messy and violent Without wanting to spoil the story or ending I must say the whole thing is a bit far fetched in detail and the ending even more so There is no real resolution and the denouement such as it is is particularly weak Indeed the story is light on the Pygmalion like personal changes Nikita goes through and her relationship with her boyfriend is rather unbelievable although it is touching The idea of her being an assassin has a curious veracity and France has been shown to use women in hazardous missions witness the Rainbow Warrior bombing in New Zealand so fortunately we are left only with a taste of silliness Besson uses some of his mafia such as electronic composer Eric Serra and actor Jean Reno as a cleaner a very black comedic role They and the other cast and production people perform well with not a step wrong Technically Hollywood couldn t do better France has made some excellent thrillers over the years DIVA comes to mind made by Besson s compatriot Beineix but let s not forget Clouzot s WAGES OF FEAR or LA BALANCE by America s expatriot Bob Swaim and many others This film compares favourably but is not quite intricate or involving enough to quite make it to the top few Nevertheless it stands out from much of the dross today and I recommend a look as you will at least enjoy the ride if not the mulling over afterwards
0979,Nikita,1990,This sort of plot has been done many times before in American films Most notably it was done in the film REMO WILLIAMS THE ADVENTURE BEGINS based on the Destroyer books of Murphy and Sapir Some super secret government agency wants to create an assassin without a background so they start with someone whom the world thinks is dead but who is not really Maybe they even arrange the purported death and then they train this zombie to be their agent Nobody misses the person nobody can trace the person either That story told competently but without too much in the way of new twists is the currently playing French film LA FEMME NIKITA The film opens with four French punks breaking into a pharmacy to steal drugs for one of them a nineteen year old woman who is clearly in a bad way The robbery goes wrong for just about everyone involved the owner of the pharmacy the police that he calls and the would be robbers Three of the punks are killed and only the young addict survives She identifies herself to the arresting police as Nikita This Nikita is not just bad news she is deadly to anyone around her The record later said that this woman committed suicide by an overdose of tranquilizers but she is in fact administered them by injection and they are not lethal Then begins the process of turning her from a sociopathic killer into a controlled weapon While LA FEMME NIKITA is playing mostly in art theaters it is not an art film any more than DIE HARD was This is a slick light weight high violence adventure film Much like REMO WILLIAMS the story of the training of the human weapon takes about half of the film and it is by far the best half In both films the actual missions that the character is assigned are rather shallow and silly exercises One mission seems to be only a make work project where the organization has done everything but actually pull the trigger and sends Nikita at great expense to pull the trigger herself It is not that Nikita is so great a marksperson since the shot seems an easy one Nor is it professionally done since she leaves the gun barrel out a window for about five minutes while she waits for her orders Nor is it that she is still untraceable since by this point she has a reasonably permanent new identity The whole sequence is there only to add some comedy and a little more action to the film LA FEMME NIKITA stands as testimony that English language film makers do not have the patent on silly action adventure This one is a likable see once and forget sort of film My rating 1 on the 4 to 4 scale
0980,If Looks Could Kill,1991,IF LOOKS COULD KILL starring Richard Grieco will be a very amusing 2 rental in the video store At 3 50 matinee rates it still provided some honest laughs but I cannot recommend it to anyone who can wait a while a short while judging from the three other people in the auditorium at the Friday 5 PM showing to see this personable hunky guy with great pecs and good definition in the tummy spend a five minute scene in rather abbreviated jockey shorts Obviously I couldn t The movie which hardly merits a serious review is a parody of secret agent flicks and especially of GOLDFINGER my favorite Bond movie Like the old Punch cartoon of the country vicar being served bad eggs by his bishop Parts are excellent And indeed the movie romps along powered by the idea of a wise guy going to France with his French teacher from Hell and the French Club to make up his French class he is immediately mistaken for Secret Agent Man who in the first of many coincidences has assumed the same name as the Grieco character The bad guys include Linda Hunt having a lot of fun with a bad German accent and a gold whip that does double duty as her necklace The scene where Grieco tours the weapons lab and get his shiny new gadgets including a Bondian sports car is pretty rich Unfortunately the movie slows down occasionally to take itself a little seriously to introduce the love element and to make room for a couple of MTV videos The woman who plays the French teacher is rather wonderful as is the madman intent on stealing all the gold in Europe Hunt s boss Also unfortunate is the skimpy special effects budget and enough editing errors to fuel r a m for a year
0981,Long Walk Home The,1990,Summary Socially correct historical drama scores in a big way by foregoing melodramatics histrionics and contrivance in favor of simple human observation and dead on accurate sense of place and time You know the type the well meaning socially redeeming liberally uplifting Hollywood movie GANDHI MISSISSIPPI BURNING LILIES OF THE FIELD CRY FREEDOM NORMA RAE Etc etc You know the characters the saintly hero es doing the right thing at deadly threat to life and limb the horrific villains eager to maim to maintain the status quo You know the scenes heroes confront injustice and muster their inner resources for the battle dramatic scenes of human transcendence as heroes reach out and touch one another in ways they never expected villains beat up on heroes who in spite of their fear and ambivalence stick to their path ultimate triumph in the end as heroes are vindicated and villains vanquished You know the sell see this movie it s Good For You I know the type too which is why THE LONG WALK HOME was on my B list of movies until last night when the starting time happened to be right It may just be my background in the South but there were several times that I wondered if I was going to be able to take the whole thing and that was just in the first half It s about the Montgomery Alabama bus boycott of 1955 56 one of the first incidents in recorded history where blacks stood up for themselves against their surrounding society Whoopi Goldberg is maid to Sissy Spacek middle class housewife and pillar of her community The details are astonishingly right from the accents to the way people look to the horrible 1950s interior decoration Most Hollywood movies set in the South don t have a clue treating the locale and its occupants like exotic threatening specimens from some far off planet who wind up unrecognizable to anybody who s actually from there Believe me this movie gets it right I can still remember my mother s bridge party cackling at the news of Martin Luther King s death and I believe I recognized one or two of them in the bridge party here Of course the credits are first rate Whoopi Goldberg has to convey quiet strength without becoming saintly and she does Sissy Spacek s housewife has to give up her whole life without a word to anyone and she does These two roles are ripe for an orgy of Acting but these two actors gave up their shot at an Oscar for the sake of their characters But what impressed me most was what s missing The villains are hissable but you recognize them as regrettable but real human beings with understandable though not admirable motives There isn t a whisper of insufferability in any of the heroes And it doesn t focus on the white middle class housewife and the way her life is touched and transformed by these Struggling Negroes It s about the most unheroic heroes you ever saw The biggest surprise omission is the lack of Big Scenes The boycott starts about two minutes into the picture and it s not even over before the end no victory rally no heroic vindication In fact you can probably spot half a dozen opportunities for the big scene each one of them resolutely passed over in favor of I think bigger stakes For example there s a scene just after a black minister s house is bombed The maids are in the kitchen doing their usual work and the housewife is just standing in the living room looking at them Not a word is said not a movement is made This film is secure enough to let you feel the gulf between those two rooms all by yourself and sure enough you do What a compliment to the audience By maintaining a human level of interaction THE LONG WALK HOME is out to touch you deeply rather than hitting you over the head with the kind of drama that these pictures specialize in And for me it succeeded magnificently Maybe it s just me maybe I was just in the mood but I haven t seen a movie in a long time that had me so close to tears so often with such understated dynamics I ll tell you it s really something different to be so moved by a movie that doesn t need histrionics or contrived heroics to do it Did I mention that I think you might like to check this movie out for yourself
0982,Long Walk Home The,1990,THE LONG WALK HOME is a powerful and moving film telling the story of simultaneous victories over racism and sexism during the 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery Alabama Sissy Spacek plays Miriam Thompson who slowly comes to realize her own importance and her power to affect events when she is torn between loyalty to her family on one hand and her social conscience on the other Miriam the wife of an influential real estate developer is shocked when the police harass her maid Odessa Cotter played by Whoopi Goldberg for accompanying Miriam s children to a whites only park Using her position she coerces the policeman into apologizing When Rosa Parks is arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus the blacks boycott the buses and Odessa begins the wearing routine of walking to and from the Thompson house Initially more out of the need to have Odessa cleaning the house on time than out of any conviction Miriam saves Odessa the long walk two mornings a week by picking her up on the way back from a convenient grocery She hides this from her husband and his red neck younger brother Eventually her husband will find out and she will have to choose between her husband s insistence that no white woman can drive a black one and her own sense that the bus boycott is right and should be supported The film is a powerful statement but it is doubtful that after 36 years any of the audience will have any sympathies against the boycott Given that is the case one might expect that director Richard Pearce and screenwriter John Cork could afford to be a little magnanimous to the losing side This most certainly is not the case With the exception of Miriam and her children whites are uniformly portrayed as being racist telling racist jokes and being hypocritical Blacks are all honest church going people wonderful to each other in closely knit families While these stereotypes may be substantially correct the portrayal makes it a little overly obvious where the audience s sympathies should lie The film also tampers a bit with historical fact The CURRENT BIOGRAPHY article on Rosa Parks says that it had previously been the practice to force blacks to enter the bus at the front pay the driver exit the bus and re enter at the rear door so as not to walk past whites already on the bus However this practice had already been abandoned at the time of Parks s arrest The film depicts this practice as if it were still going on at the time of the arrest Certainly the truth is damning enough without distorting it to make an even stronger case While it would be difficult to exaggerate the degree of polarization of whites against blacks at the time this film manages While it was a small percentage of Southern whites who supported the black cause this film implies there were no more than a half dozen or so adult whites supporting the blacks which does something of a disservice to those whites who were courageous to stand up for their conscience It is the opposite problem to the one of MISSISSIPPI BURNING which went to the other extreme having it be mostly whites in the form of the FBI coming in and fighting for black freedom My suspicion is that THE LONG WALK HOME is the closer to being accurate but the truth lies somewhere in the range between the points of view of the two films Pacing is also a minor problem It takes Miriam a long time to decide she will make a stand then when the story gets going it is over with the remaining history told in screen titles Still THE LONG WALK HOME is good filmmaking It makes the viewer angry about injustice rather than just depressed about it the way GUILTY BY SUSPICION does On that basis it deserves a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0983,After Dark My Sweet,1990,Cast Jason Patric Rachel Ward Bruce Dern Director James Foley Screenplay Robert Redlin James Foley based on Jim Thompson s novel Just about any book on screenwriting stresses that the first few pages of a screenplay must establish the main character s personality and introduce the major conflict Few means 3 5 or 7 which translates to 3 5 or 7 minutes It s a good thing that Redlin Foley ignored such advice AFTER DARK MY SWEET pulls you in bit by bit always holding back and making you try to fit the pieces together Interesting from the very beginning it sure as hell doesn t follow a formula Ken Collins Jason Patric is an ex boxer When we first meet him we discover that he has escaped from an institution but it isn t clear why he was institutionalized We meet up with him in the Californian desert where his voice over begins the narration that continues throughout the film He has a diffident voice stumbling non energetic shy and reserved Non Hollywood His gait is curious too he walks with his shoulders hunched forward his legs advancing him toward an unknown opponent in the peculiar somehow awkward stance of the boxer He stops in a bar and tries to strike up a conversation with Fay Anderson Rachel Ward who immediately sizes him up as a stupid oaf When the bartender attempts to throw him out Collins reflexes take over He stumbles out into the desert along the highway where Fay impulsively picks him up She looks at his face and renames him Collie There they are on a road in Indio California The landscape provides nothing absolutely nothing No reason to stay but too hot and still for people to summon the energy to leave Everything that happens just seems to happen all by itself and the flat endless landscape is flattened still further by a relentless sun A friend describes this film as Technicolor noir Maybe he read that somewhere or maybe he made it up himself but it s a good label Certainly the tone is film noir and the overbearing light in this film serves the same purpose as the dark shadowed images of yesteryear While regular film noir depends upon particularly malevolent characters and a pervasive pessimism AFTER DARK MY SWEET differs in that the characters aren t stereotypical or especially stylized Although the characters are at once recognizable they are in some sense archetypes instead of stereotypes Also in contrast to film noir is the holdout for hope that the characters maintain I don t want to spoil this for you by telling you too much about the story or giving away too much about the characters Let me put it this way though these characters are complex and their relationships constantly shift The acting is superb I d never even heard of Jason Patric before but I know of him now and greatly respect his ability Rachel Ward is grand Bruce Dern is perfect as Uncle Bob a schemer who amuses Fay Hats off to the writers of this play for creating such complete characters and events that just start happening In contrast to many screenplays the characters reactions to events and opportunities actually drive the story Put another way the plot doesn t drive the characters the characters drive the plot Rare is the screenplay that allows this to happen Why this didn t get more attention is beyond me It s well worth seeing and Patric s performance makes this a film worth buying Rent it though and tell me what you think And tell me what the heck the title has to do with the film OK I never did get it
0984,Highlander II: The Quickening,1991,Plot Summary The year is 2024 The ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by Connor McCleod The shield although saving lives has made the atmosphere hot and humid Connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope On returning from the opera one night Connor is accosted by the leader of a terrorist organisation They have tried to find out what the Company that now runs the shield unit are covering up Connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by Katana from the planet Zeist like Zeit get it They fail and Connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off He then brings Ramirez back to life in Glencoe in Scotland Both Ramirez and Connor are rebel leaders back on Zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment Connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the Company and the shield Katana meanwhile fearing Connor would return sets out himself to kill the Highlander Being a fan of Highlander and Mr Connery I was in the cinema as soon as I could to see HIGHLANDER II THE QUICKENING I wish it had been quicker I feel whatever else you can say about a film bad script bad music etc if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said The film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so the time Mr Connery is on the screen for is worth watching The plot sounds a little ridiculous but I was willing to give it a chance Maybe they could pull it off Instead I find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film It s as if they are different people with the same names Witness Connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance where is the attitude of who wants to live forever when love must die gone to The love sub plot must have had footage cut out The highlander and Ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before Putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying I still want to know why Connor s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal We are not given enough time on Zeist to believe in it nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill Why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck I know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first To be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world s worst shot Meanwhile Connor develops Luke Skywalker like powers of laser beam deflection As for bad guys we see a rebellion on Zeist crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on Katana being obsessed with killing McCleod in case he returns to Zeist Two assassins are sent presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged Connor kills them both with no problems No more assassins are sent Katana supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill Connor Has he no more assassins Has he no better Why was the rebellion crushed so easily then Michael Ironside is totally unconvincing bring back the Kurgan He seems like a cartoon character and really isn t that evil just stupid and violent We see the Hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents Yet he still seems like no threat perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten Connor or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn t have been amiss with Larry Curly and Mo So much for plot and characters The music is atrocious It is at best intrusive and at worst annoying Bring back Queen There was an audible sigh of relief when Connor played a Queen track in a juke box I believe this at least is to be corrected for the American release The acting is at best flat except for Mr Connery Lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered There can be only one this time around it just made me wish there had only been one HIGHLANDER Michael Ironside is unconvincing sorry Michael I usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable So why 2 10 Visually the film is interesting at all times It has a BLADE RUNNER feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning Add to this an irrepressible Sean Connery who smiles throughout the whole film or is he smirking to himself His lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey I d have done it for 12 million Oh and I agree with a previous reviewer she does look like Sharon Stone but I believe it is her first film Incidentally there is a line producer credited and I hear rumours of HIGHLANDER III THE WIZARD
0985,Highlander II: The Quickening,1991,I went to see the sequel to HIGHLANDER last night and I can honestly say it is very irritating HIGHLANDER was a kind of magic where the mystery was maintained throughout the film the characters were intelligent and the film made an effort to make us believe what we were seeing HIGHLANDER II THE QUICKENING makes no effort along these lines and in fact appears to have been written by someone who didn t watch the first film carefully The plot is simple the world has lost its ozone layer and people are dying from UV radiation from the sun McCloud has developed some ingenious device which places a shield around the earth to block off the UV radiation We see it switched on and then skip 25 years into the future where we find the shield is blocking all light from the sun and stars and an evil company now controls the shield The countries of the world pay the shield company to keep the radiation from their people and so this company has something of a monopoly The world is a depressing place which is in constant darkness and decay Having got the plot out of the way in about six minutes including the credits and about four sentences of meaningful dialogue the film starts to destroy the magic of the first film Firstly we find out that McCloud is in fact an alien from the planet Zeiss and together with a bunch of rebels including Ramirez was banished to earth When only one rebel was left on earth the winner would gain the prize either be mortal on earth no mention this time of the knowledge or return to Zeiss Before McCloud is captured on Zeiss he and Ramirez go through a ceremony called the quickening in which they both dunk their fingers in a pot of water This basic plot causes a whole bunch of problems How was Ramirez sent to a different point in time to McCloud This planet doesn t have time travel and all the other transfers arrive together How come McCloud doesn t recognise Ramirez in the first film if in fact they were fairly good friends to start off with How come the villagers in Scotland didn t notice McCloud didn t have a Scottish accent when he turned up Why did he have to be taught to sword fight when that was the main weapon they used on Zeiss McCloud had the prize and knew what everyone was thinking home come he only solved the ozone problem what about war and famine are we to believe he didn t turn his talent to those problems after he perfected the shield Obviously with McCloud aging and all the other immortals dead the film then decides its time to add some action The ruler of the planet Zeiss General something or other decides that he doesn t want McCloud back on Zeiss and so sends out a couple of guys to wipe him out McCloud dispatches them and because they were immortals he too becomes immortal again and returns to being the age he was when he lost his immortality So the General decides to turn up and do the job himself He decides to take over the shield company for no reason that is explained or even questioned during the film and then McCloud and he fight it out guess who wins Having done this McCloud then destroys the shield he has found out along the way that the ozone layer has repaired itself and so we wait for HIGHLANDER III Ramirez is reincarnated by McCloud and helps out in a few bits and pieces along the way Nothing significant basically he s the comic interlude There is a female in the film basically a blonde bimbo terrorist who demonstrates no intelligence to whom McCloud is attracted It is she who discovers the ozone layer is back when she and a bunch of friends break into the control room for the shield and take a reading She then follows McCloud around for the rest of the movie There are many bits of the film that are just done for effect When the general arrives he lands on earth in a tube train that s subway train for the Americans and decides that he wants some new clothes So he kills the nearest guy wearing something he likes Then he decides to drive the train General I bet you ve always wanted to drive one of these Some poor kid he has by the neck nods General Me too A curious statement as he s just arrived from a planet where there was no evidence of anything that even looked like an American subway train He then manages to get the train up to 400 miles per hour gets it to look like a Catherine wheel and then ploughs it through a brick wall in which it stops after about 30 feet without even a dent to the driver s cabin The special effects are all done to excess they are also very poor The flight scenes between McCloud and the immortal assassins are done by speeding the film up This presumably was done to make some fast action however the camera moves too fast making it hard to follow and the flying is jerky and has no grace Some scenes are shown at normal speed and this gives a far better impression of the gracefulness of a sword fight in the air The scenes where McCloud kills an immortal are seriously overdone In the first HIGHLANDER there were usually a few things moving and a few cars going bang In this one he has the effect of a fairly large bomb Everything within 100 yards bursts into flames including all the cars most of the buildings and a petrol tanker that happened to be passing The death toll should have been about 100 but it seems McCloud wasn t worried about all this destruction he had just wreaked and calmly walks away So here are the movie goofs I spotted Firstly the script Secondly when the general is transported to earth you see his ungloved hand just before he disappears when he arrives on earth it is gloved When McCloud and Ramirez go to the maximum security prison then are machine gunned we see McCloud s door open and he is shown taking lots of bullets on the floor When the bimbo is taken from the boot she looks into the car and McCloud is now comfortable in his seat and the door is closed I also got confused between the max security prison and the shield It seems that at the end these are the same place and yet I got the impression they were supposed to be separate In conclusion this is a reasonable film but a very poor sequel For that reason I d score it 2 on a scale of 4 to 4
0986,Queens Logic,1991,The summary I posted above DINER goes to Queens is not necessarily dismissive DINER was a great film and we need more films like DINER I used to call these films coming of age films thinking of such examples as AMERICAN GRAFFITI but as I wrote this review it occurred to me that most of the most interesting examples of this genre involve post adolescents although the central event is one that finally forces the group to grow up These films involve a group of long time friends who are either reunited or one of them who has been away for a long time finally returns The cause for their reunion is usually an event like a wedding or a funeral although it may sometimes simply be a regular reunion The films are usually comedies Some of the best films in this genre in my opinion are the aforementioned DINER THE RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN THE BIG CHILL FIVE CORNERS and THE WANDERERS the only example in the group that is about adolescents The worst film in this genre that I can think of is ST ELMO S FIRE QUEENS LOGIC falls somewhere in the middle although on the better than average side The plot is easily summarized One of the gang is about to get married They all hang out together and are joined by one friend who returns from California for the wedding They hang out talk about life get drunk Each has a problem Al s wife has just walked out on him Ray the one about to get married is getting cold feet Denny was never the success in Hollywood that he claims to be Vince is looking for love or maybe just a good lay it s not clear which Elliot is a homosexual which according to Hollywood rules is supposed to make him unhappy Everything comes to a head at the big bachelor s party which is more like a regular great party than a traditional bachelor s party Let s talk about what s wrong with the movie first Most of the characters are simply labels Ray is an Artist Denny is a California Musician Vince is a Lover Elliot is a Tormented Homosexual A little more depth in the characterizations would have been appreciated Also the women s roles are generally peripheral In a film where relations with women are central Al s wife Ray s wedding the women are good long suffering and eventually forgiving Jamie Lee Curtis shows up in a cameo that s somewhat inexplicable The screenplay could have been a little more carefully written There are two incidents involving a gun near the end of the film that are almost replays of each other The first one worked the second could have been taken out Also some of the set piece speeches just don t work The film trades on a Queens mystique But the problem is there is no Queens mystique It s just a place and not a very interesting one either At least not in the white working class ethnic areas they concentrate on there are some very interesting ethnic neighborhoods in Queens I have some limited experience in this I was born in Flushing spent a year in Forest Hills and my mother s family comes from Queens It s just not such an interesting place So what s good about the film The main thing that s good about it is Joe Mantegna as Al His performance holds the film together just as Al holds the group of friends together This is the first thing I ve ever seen Mantegna do that I ve really liked The other things I ve seen him in were HOUSE OF GAMES THINGS CHANGE and THE GODFATHER PART III John Malkovich is good as Elliot but he s been good in everything I ve seen him in Tom Waits has an excellent small part as a wonderfully strange shady character named Monty The best thing about the movie is the friendship between the characters It s believable that these guys have been together for a long time and that the genuinely like each other Since the friendship is what s on screen most of the time the film worked for me
0987,Mortal Thoughts,1991,Micro summary Alan Rudolph does a murder mystery Summary A young woman Demi Moore gets inadvertently involved in a murder committed by her best friend Glenne Headley The facts come out at the police interrogation I ll just start by saying that Alan Rudolph is one of my favorite filmmakers and that he s done some of my favorite films THE MODERNS and TROUBLE IN MIND He always tries something unusual and it s usually interesting When the film started though I was surprised Where was the surreal or hyperreal story line and physical setting Where is Rudolph s production company Geraldine Chaplin Keith Carradine Genevieve Bujold Something unusual was going on As I learned later this isn t entirely an Alan Rudolph film Rudolph joined the production a week into the shooting when the producers Demi Moore and Taylor Hackford fired the original director and brought in Rudolph Rudolph was able to bring long time collaborator Mark Isham to do the music but he had no hand in the story Still he was able to put his stamp on the film Cynthia Kellogg Demi Moore and Joyce Urbansky Glenne Headley are best friends Cynthia also works in Joyce s beauty parlor Joyce is married to James a dangerous and violent lout played by Bruce Willis Moore s real life husband Joyce keeps talking about killing James and well one day it happens Cynthia is there and she ends up helping her friend conceal the evidence and gets involved more and more deeply The strain affects both women and the friendship unravels Cynthia isn t helped by the fact that her own husband isn t any great shakes although he s a step above James All of this is revealed as flashbacks during Cynthia s interrogation But the senior detective Harvey Keitel has some doubts about Cynthia s story The film is nicely paced and the screenplay gives us good reason to understand why James is killed when it happens We understand how and why a law abiding friend can be drawn into a crime and then find it hard to extricate herself The friendship between the two women is believable Their acting is good as is that of Willis who makes a convincing and hateful villain The supporting characters particularly Keitel s detective and Cynthia s husband John Pankow are well drawn and well acted The ending is good Won t say anything more than that This is a superior murder mystery Rudolph s contribution lies in the pacing which is slow enough to raise the tension along with appropriate use of slow motion and sound vivid colors and shiny lights reflected in wet nighttime streets Isham s music contributes to the atmosphere The main problem is that he s constrained by the realism of the script which just doesn t allow many of the strange Rudolph touches like the alternate reality of Rain City Seattle in TROUBLE IN MIND or the modern art painted backdrops to many of the scenes in THE MODERNS This is definitely Bayonne NJ in the late 1980 s and there s nothing Rudolph can do to change that As I said before this is a superior murder mystery and it also shows that Rudolph is capable of handling conventional genre filmmaking if he has to So it s worth seeing in itself However there are any number of directors who could have made this film I d rather wait for a film that only Alan Rudolph could make
0988,Society,1989,Director Brian Yuzna Writers Woody Keith and Rick Fry Producer Keith Walley Executive Producers Paul White Keizo Kabata and Terry Ogisu Cinematography Rick Fichter Special Make Up Effects Screaming Mad George Cast Billy Warlock Devin De Vasquez Evan Richards Ben Ferguson Patrice Jennings Tim Bartell Heidi Kozak This film is directed by Brian Yuzna of REANIMATOR and BRIDE OF REANIMATOR fame It was released in Europe in 1989 and was a success in England but never released in the United States It had its US debut at the USA Film Festival in Dallas on April 20 1991 The film centers on Bill Billy Warlock an upper class teenager living in Beverly Hills Bill is the star of the basketball team dating a blonde cheerleader and a shoe in for class president He is also visiting a psychiatrist and feels like he is totally different from anyone else in his family His parents and older sister seem alien to him This is a common theme among teenager films and done fairly well here with the difference being that we in the audience quickly realize that there is more to Bill s feelings than normal teenage angst somewhat reminiscent of PARENTS The theme of class differences also is meant to be brought out but suffers somewhat because no one in the film actually seems to be of a different or lower class The class differences are more implied than demonstrated Bill feels like part of the lower class even though the rest of his family is upper class This feeling of difference feeds his suspicions and he slowly becomes aware that they may have substance beyond his feelings A spurned boyfriend of his sister not our kind of people bugs her car during the drive to her coming out party and gets a tape of a conversation between Bill s sister and parents The casual chit chat is about a bizarre rite that resembles the normal coming out festivities only in parody First you copulate with a young male your age then you copulate with us and then When Bill needs another copy of the tape the former boyfriend is killed in a suspicious car accident The odd incidents increase as Bill gets more uneasy All the time he is assured that he is imagining things and that he will make a great contribution to Society a bit of heavy handed foreshadowing Bill also becomes romantically and sexually involved with a girl who is part of the somehow different and privileged class Finally Bill is waylaid and hospitalized by his parents and psychiatrist This is the point that the film changes from one of paranoid menace to horror Bill apparently looses any of the common sense that he exhibited earlier in the movie a trait seen too often in horror movie protagonists He returns home to find all his parents society friends having a party and he is both the entertainment and entree The action picks up quickly as the true nature of the members of Society becomes apparent The usual goo and gore chases and escapes result with an ending that leaves too many loose ends to be satisfying My main problem with the movie comes at the transition point As soon as the horror portion of the film begins the tone of the movie changes from one of menace to outlandishness Any message suddenly becomes lost in a host of special effects The effects are well done and effective at conveying gross and gruesome but they overpower all else Failed heavy handed attempts at humor also contribute to the destruction of the mood created earlier in the film I suspect that the director wanted to have the horror add to the menace but the two did not sync The subtle feelings of unease are completely overwhelmed by the grotesque imagery Brian Yuzna and Screaming Mad George were in attendance Mr Yuzna is very likable and I wish I had a better review of his movie but I also wish I had seen a better movie

0991,Mortal Thoughts,1991,MORTAL THOUGHTS is a film by Alan Rudolph starring Demi Moore Glenne Headley with Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel inter alios MORTAL THOUGHTS is a suspense film about the death of the Willis character James and told through a series of flashbacks framed by a police interrogation of Moore The device works well and lets the script slip us a few interesting surprises Alan Rudolph is one of my favorite directors when he is working with his own scripts such as CHOOSE ME or THE MODERNS This film unfortunately is not one of these It is a project he took on at the last minute and as such is one of his second string efforts To compensate for the general lack of Rudolphian quirkiness the film features some glitzy photography and flashy editing The overall effect is slightly fussy I think But still it s a watchable effort and one that is not totally unworthy of some qualified admiration For one thing Demi Moore is slightly wonderful as the Italian American working class hairdresser in Bayonne NJ MORTAL THOUGHTS they may be but the accent is strictly down and dirty Joisey Moore gets to do some acting for a change It turns out that she is not a totally discreditable actor if fact I was impressed by her gritty unpatronizing portrayal It redeems her role in GHOST for me Glenne Headley whose name I may or may not be spelling correctly plays Cynthia James wife and the Moore character s boss and lifelong friend She brings to her part a similar egalitarian flair for Bayonne and the added fillip of getting to portray a woman not that stable to start and who descends into a kind of madness by the end It s a well modulated performance and one which I greatly enjoyed Willis gets to play James the totally irredeemable druggie abusive husband layabout and general scumbag And Rudolph to his enormous credit got Willis to play this unattractive role without a glint of that horrible Willisian cuteness and charm It maybe that Willis too is under it all an actor Harvey Keitel is the cop who conducts most of the interview and is wonderful as always The other character actors were also attractive and effective in their roles Indeed this is a movie for acting buffs more than story buffs perhaps I was interested but not compelled alert but not alarmed through the unfolding of the story I can recommend MORTAL THOUGHTS to anyone who can get to a cheap matinee I hope Rudolph made enough off this movie so that he do one of his own next
0992,Object of Beauty The,1991,Capsule review A well crafted comedy with some nice dramatic moments and some serious things to say This story is of the theft of a valuable piece of art from a spendthrift American couple living in London The story touches a broad range of emotions with some of the minor characters more interesting than the main ones Rating 2 It is fairly easy to make a comedy with an Eddie Murphy or a Bette Midler mugging away on the screen and a lot of artificial gags With a film like that you know why it is enjoyable and ten minutes after it is over it is really over It is much harder to make a comedy with solid three dimensional characters in a situation that is not obviously comedic and just let well observed characters drive the story OBJECT OF BEAUTY is at least nominally a comedy but it spans a broad range of emotion It is a good story well told Jake and Tina played by John Malkovitch and Andie MacDowell are an American wheeler dealer and his girlfriend living together in a posh London hotel and virtually hemorrhaging money The problem is that it is money that Jake can ill afford to waste on meals that cost over a hundred pounds Jake is hoping for a big return on an investment in cocoa which has been washed out by a dock strike in Sierra Leone He needs money desperately and wants to sell a valuable Henry Moore sculpture that Tina was given by her husband Larry Tina prefers hiding the object d art and claiming the insurance Meanwhile the lonely deaf mute chambermaid delicately played by Rudi Davis finds that this little bronze head is the only solace for the loneliness of her affliction She spirits the head away and keeps it as a needed friend Since Jake and Tina had just discussed hiding the head for the insurance each suspects the other has done just that and is holding out on the other The story then moves between the two worlds One is the hotel where Jake and Tina are finding this new strain destroying their relationship It is also where Jake is finding it increasingly difficult to dodge the hotel management on the matter of his bad credit while he is still getting them to pursue the matter of the missing piece of art The other world is the lonely one of Jenny the chambermaid and her delinquent brother Here what has been a light comedy gives way to some serious drama including at least two scenes of real dramatic power The script by Michael Lindsey Hogg who also directed seems to have attracted a first rate but oddly matched cast of supporting actors including Lolita Davidovich from BLAZE as Tina s best friend veteran British heavy Joss Ackland as the hotel manager Bill Paterson from COMFORT AND JOY and Peter Riegert from ANIMAL HOUSE and CROSSING DELANCEY as Tina s real husband The script is subtle and rewarding in a way that the British seem to do far better than the Americans This is a rewarding story with a good balance of comedy and drama I rate it 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0993,Shadow of a Doubt,1991,When I was growing up I was aware that there were a series of dramas brought to television by the Hallmark Hall of Fame It seemed that near card sending holidays Hallmark would do a television play and some were decent but I would have preferred to go out to a movie any day I think as I got older Hallmark really did get better I know my perspective changed but I genuinely feel that objectively they improved also I first noticed how good they had gotten in 1979 with the remake of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT I liked the film a lot and really wanted to see the original classic film Actually I was a bit disappointed by the original which did not seem to be so detailed a story or have so well developed characters But I told myself it was not a fair comparison The original was an early sound film before a lot of techniques were developed Besides I d seen the remake first and it had formed my opinions on the story I also preferred their BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to Cocteau s but then I am not a big fan of Cocteau s style I ran out of excuses with Michael Tuchner s HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME I had seen the three major film productions with Lon Chaney Charles Laughton and Anthony Quinn in the title role Anthony Hopkins was the best Quasimodo and this production was the most detailed I have also liked some of their original productions but have only recently started paying closer attention to them DECORATION DAY was among the best five films I saw last year If I was going to put made for television movies on my Top Ten of the Year list this would have made the list Now Hallmark is back remaking the classic film This may be their first real suspense film but they are starting with grand style Overall the production values of SHADOW OF A DOUBT were very good They used the original script which was co authored by Thorton Wilder The murderous gigolo Uncle Charley was played by Mark Harmon in the role that Joseph Cotten originally filled Now Harmon is a lot better looking than Cotten almost pretty Had someone with Harmon s looks played the role in the Hitchcock you have never have been able to put someone with Cotten s looks in the remake But putting someone better looking in the role of the charming and villainous lady killer works just fine Harmon is not a very good actor and he does not project much emotion In this role his synthetic charm and the veiled emotion work in his favor The remake on its own is a pretty good suspense film The Hitchcock film was made in 1943 and being made during the war it was intended to show the soldiers what they were fighting for It was a portrait of somebody s idea of an ideal American town pearly white Anglo Saxon Protestant It was a town where just about everyone sees each other in church It was set in its present of 1943 The remake is a slight update being set in 1953 the year Fidel Castro was captured and imprisoned we hear about the event on the console radio That really is the film s one questionable note In a town like Petaluma California I doubt there were still many wind up Victrolas in 1953 With that one minor objection this remake is done in fine style I would give it a 2 on the 4 to 4 scale
0994,Reise der Hoffnung,1990,Synopsis A low income Turkish family leaves Turkey for a better life in Switzerland Unfortunately they are illegal immigrants and are preyed on by smugglers and other criminals on their trip Their journey of hope turns into a desperate struggle for survival when they are abandoned in the Alps by a smuggler A good story but not told very well a generally mediocre film Switzerland Turkish German with English subtitles color 1990 105 min Director Xavier Koller The story is centered on a poor farmer in Turkey and his family He has received a postcard from a relative who emigrated to Switzerland telling him that Switzerland is sort of a paradise over the mountain paraphrased He is determined to go to Switzerland to find a better life at any cost To this end he sells his cattle sheep and land to get the money he needs for false passports and to pay the smugglers However his wife insists on taking the children they have seven Reluctantly the husband agrees to take only one child the youngest The rest will remain in Turkey with his parents They begin their journey and things go smoothly at first However problems arise when they get to Istanbul there are no tickets or passport for the child The story continues as the smugglers hide the family in a cargo container for the journey to Milan next stop on their journey This film won the Academy Award for best foreign language film competing with such films as JU DOU and CYRANO DE BERGERAC Although I feel that the film industry grants so many awards that most are meaningless I really hoped that this film would be better than average Unfortunately the film is very ordinary and did not live up to expectations The last part of the film is relatively exciting and many viewers will react to it emotionally However the problem with the film is the first part which you must endure to get to the last part In the first part you see the farmer behaving in a completely irrational way He is not wealthy but he is able to support seven children from his small farm Unfortunately he is primarily interested in money he and his wife argue on this point when he tells her they must leave the children behind for an indefinite period Where is his fatherly concern for his children Is going to Switzerland worth the destruction of a family of nine The problem with the film is that there is insufficient characterization particularly for the farmer whose actions drive the film You see his mistakes and frequent irrational behavior but the motives for his actions have not been sufficiently established Because of this you might not be fully sympathetic with the characters when they get into trouble I think that people will react to this film in one of two ways the mind approach given above in which case you might view the film as a case study in irresponsible behavior or the heart approach By heart I mean that you will fully identify with the characters in which case you might think the film is pretty good Even though it is mediocre average the film does illustrate the refugee and illegal immigration issues that are major political topics of the day Some might consider the film worth seeing simply because it dramatizes those issues Overall I think the film is definitely over rated and is only average first part is below average second part above average Your reaction to the film may vary according to your interpretation of the rationality of the farmer s actions Distribution General U S release occurs this month May The U S distributor is Miramax Films
0995,Asfour Stah,1990,Synopsis A kind hearted story of the coming of age of a 12 year old boy in modern Tunisia Provides a rare look into sensuality and sexuality in modern Arab societies Charming frequently witty and funny and very entertaining Tunisia France English subtitles color 1990 98 minutes Director Writer Ferid Boughedir The story centers on Noura a 12 year old boy who is small for his age Because of his size and appearance he is still permitted to accompany his mother to the women s bathhouse Inasmuch as Noura is feeling the first desires associated with puberty the baths are centers of eroticism to him as they are full of naked partially naked women I wonder whether the film was screened uncensored i e including nudity in Tunisia However Noura is growing up and he will soon be banished from the women s baths and the society of women into the much harsher society of men The story line centers on Noura s exploits as he explores his new and growing sexual desires Typical of hormone comedies he has two male friends who are a bad influence on him and encourage him to engage in various types of mischief Noura s entry into the world of men is helped by two women his mother s cousin and a beautiful young woman hired as a maid in Noura s household Because of religious sensitivities films from Arab countries usually cannot be as frank about sexuality and sensuality as Western films In some ways that can be good because it can force the filmmakers to use humor or wit to compensate An example is the film THE CITADEL an extremely funny and witty film about polygamy and the effects of uncontrolled sexual desire What makes HALFAOUINE interesting is the direct view it provides of sexuality and sensuality in an Arab culture The view is generally kind hearted and relatively upbeat In an interview published in the San Francisco International Film Festival Program Guide the director Ferid Boughedir explains his treatment of sexuality It has always fascinated me how everyday sensuality has always belied the inflexibility of official dogma At a time when cliches about the Arab culture are becoming as arbitrary as ever I am tempted to talk about a Mediterranean society that can still be experienced today a society that is luxuriant and tender where humor and eroticism are always prevalent together with tolerance a word rather difficult to brandish about today The film has been compared to MY LIFE AS A DOG another story of a young boy s coming of age However HALFAOUINE is more upbeat and does not have the melancholy spirit of MY LIFE AS A DOG Of the two films I strongly prefer HALFAOUINE for its pleasant humor and wit Because of its pleasant humor and wit I recommend the film to a general audience Overall the movie rates in the very good excellent range Print Source Ervin Cohen Jessup 9401 Wilshire Blvd 9th Floor Beverly Hills CA 90064 Note a screening is scheduled for 5 9 91 at the Aquarius Twin Cinema in Palo Alto CA
0996,Guilty by Suspicion,1991,Rarely in these days of socialist Big Government does one get to see a movie that is daring enough to support true American values GUILTY BY SUSPICION is such a movie The plot is based on the well known but oft distorted patriotic actions of HUAC The House Un American Affairs Committee in the 1950s when a Hollywood rotten with Communists and Liberal Fellow Travellers was purged of its socialist toxins Robert De Niro plays one such commie writer who returns from a European trip The Soviet Union I need not point out is in Europe and is asked by his employers to cooperate with HUAC in its crusade against the corrupters of America De Niro s character refuses this very reasonable request and over the next two hours is smashed like the communist filth he is I particularly enjoyed the careful and thorough case HUAC assembles against De Niro We are shown he has friends like An alcoholic woman judged unfit to raise her child who kills herself a mortal sin after a pathetic binge I need not point out that a woman who can t raise her own offspring is a crime against human nature The family is no matter what the perfumed homosexuals of Hollywood might claim the basis of all human civilisation An obese comedy writer who can neither control his craving for food not his craving for approval from his socialist friends who refuses to testify to a Congressional Committee of the United States of America De Niro s wife a communist teacher whose access to the pure minds of American Youth is rightly taken away She is shown undermining the USA s defenses in one telling scene She and De Niro are divorced The usual Hollywood serial polygamy no doubt but later in the movie he is shown living with her What kind of an example must they set for their child two single adults living together outside the bounds of matrimony De Niro s character is shown to be paranoid when he attacks a man and his wife while they are out enjoying American Free Enterprise Clearly the anticipation of the Stalinistic purges that would have swept the USA if not for HUAC eroded his mind These are just some of the examples of moral corruption HUAC has to deal with in this film They succeed in sniffing out communism in cases a normal untrained observer would have mistaken as perfectly harmless or even as Pro American What you think I d post this without a disclaimer Tee Hee Just a joke folks apologies to those who took it seriously Inspired by a comment by a friend and a conversation I eavesdropped on
0997,Cabeza de Vaca,1991,Synopsis The story of Cabeza de Vaca a Spanish explorer shipwrecked off the coast of Florida in 1528 who performed the incredible feat of traveling by foot from Florida to the Pacific coast of Mexico an eight year journey of hardship and adventure The director put more emphasis on ethnographic details than on story telling and the film reflects this An interesting film nonetheless Mexico English subtitles color 1990 112 minutes Director Writer Nicolas Echeverria Screenplay based on the book Naufragios by Alvar Nunez In 1528 Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca the treasurer on a Spanish expedition to the New World was shipwrecked on the coast of Florida with several other men from the expedition This began an eight year journey on foot no horses in those days horses were introduced later across the new land of America to the Pacific coast of Mexico It s an incredible true story although the film appears to have quite a bit of fiction mixed in with the facts The film begins with Cabeza de Vaca arriving in a Spanish settlement in Mexico Then thru a long flashback the story unfolds It begins with the shipwreck in Florida The shipwrecked men find wooden trunks from their ship amidst evidence of cannibalism The men are attacked by Native American tribesmen and Cabeza de Vaca becomes a slave to a shaman sorcerer Cabeza de Vaca views his fate in spiritual terms and becomes something of a shaman himself The shaman recognizes his spiritual power of healing and sets Cabeza de Vaca free The story continues as he heads west alone This is the first feature film by director Nicolas Echeverria who is an ethnologist and has done a number of documentaries His knowledge of Native American culture shows in the detailed interesting view it provides of the Native American tribes that Cabeza de Vaca encounters These are not the Hollywood Indians of old westerns nor do these cultures resemble the DANCES WITH WOLVES images Rather it is a view of Native Americans before the influx of the white man So there are no horses as horses were introduced by Europeans and the Native Americans live in primitive hunting and gathering societies that are very close to the stone age in terms of technology I think the film is worth seeing for the view it gives of early Native American culture However the film has a number of flaws some of which detract from the story The film is the story of the outward journey of Cabeza de Vaca and his inward journey as he becomes a faith healer of sorts His interaction with Native American shamanism is the driving force in the story and the story is not told very well Some of the editing is abrupt and there are huge gaps in the story In one scene Cabeza de Vaca is being set free in Florida in the next scene he is walking in a snowstorm in what appears to be the West Further we see only 3 different tribes in his long journey across America One serious technical error deserves mention In the scenes that are supposedly taking place in Florida there are mountains in the background As one who grew up in Florida I can guarantee that there are positively no mountains in Florida The Florida scenes were filmed in a mangrove swamp possibly in Yucatan Although the abrupt editing and faith healing subplot detract from the film it is still worth seeing for the view of early before the arrival of the Europeans Native American cultures The film is rather interesting though I didn t find it to be very entertaining Distribution The production credits for the film list a number of financial sources which suggest that the film will get wide distribution These include American Playhouse Theatrical Films implying an art house run in the U S possibly followed 2 years after theatrical release by broadcast on PBS television stations in the U S Channel 4 Television England possible television broadcast Television Espana Spain television etc Print Source Ventana Films 2021 Rosilla Place Los Angeles CA 90046
0999,Object of Beauty The,1991,THE OBJECT OF BEAUTY is a film written and directed by Michael Lindsay Hogg starring John Malkovich and Andie MacDowell with Joss Ackland Peter Reigert Lolita Davidovich and Rudi Davies THE OBJECT OF BEAUTY brings together two actors from two of my favorite 1989 films Malkovich in DANGEROUS LIAISONS Andie MacDowell in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE in a story that seems to have been written to showcase their delicate aristocratic mannerisms If theirs had been the only story it would at best have resulted in a shallow comedy of manners two spoiled jet setters living off the last of their used up credit united in their mutual mistrust their mutual fear of being broke and having to give up luxurious London hotels and the rest She owns a 9 inch Henry Moore sculpture worth 40 000 she won t sell it but she might fake its theft and take the insurance money But when it turns up missing they both think the other took it What saves the characters and the movie is the radiant presence of the hearing impaired hotel maid played by Rudi Davies Her life of poverty parallels Jake and Tina in their brocaded suite her struggle to find a place for herself her punk younger brother who wants to take care of them someday just as Tina is waiting for Jake to take care of her and the power of the Henry Moore over her life Davies doesn t speak she glows brighter than her red hair with a beauty than MacDowell may someday achieve if she s lucky The same sad beauty of the Henry Moore the beauty of experience of having lived of having perceived something behind the quotidian Not that I don t admire Andie MacDowell greatly for her sly skills as a deft subtle comedienne I don t think she s quite as good here as she was in SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE but it s close a talking point certainly Malkovich s Jake reminds me of Jeremy Irons in REVERSAL OF FORTUNE if only less fascinating and more human He s funny despicable and sympathetic especially when he drops his upper crust moue long enough to give us a glimpse of the frightened man behind it Of the other players I give much praise to Joss Ackland the duplicitous hotel manager whose oleaginous will is to avoid scenes and run his hotel on a seamless cloud of perfection whatever compromises and dirty deals are required Peter Reigert is Tina s soon to be ex the man who started it all by giving Tina the Henry Moore The little bust is itself a kind of character too as it passes through many hands inspiring a range of emotions and serenely being itself in a variety of environments The only casting problem was that the script really had too little for the wonderful Lolita Davidovitch to do Still it s always good to see her on screen Over all THE OBJECT OF BEAUTY is a well crafted subtle comedy about growth that makes humans out of us all Highly recommended even at full prices
10000,Lost World: Jurassic Park The,1997,Chad z rating out of 4 fair below average 1997 PG 13 134 minutes 2 hours 14 minutes starring Jeff Goldblum Dr Ian Malcolm Julianne Moore Dr Sarah Harding Vince Vaughn Nick Van Owen Arliss Howard Peter Ludlow written by David Koepp produced by Gerald R Molen Colin Wilson directed by Steven Spielberg based on the novel by Michael Crichton Seen November 29 1997 on home video rented They say when you ve got a winning strategy don t change your game plan That s good advice unfortunately the one place it doesn t work is Hollywood or else The Lost World Jurassic Park might have been something original Instead it s just a repeat of everything Spielberg s done before and proves some things are only impressive once The film opens in typical Spielberg fashion with a supposedly charming scene that also shows the advances made in special effects Initially it is interesting to watch but within a few minutes we get a lot of screaming and off screen bloodshed and it s apparent the film is going to be much like the original Jurassic Park That feeling of deja vu continues to manifest itself as the story unfolds much like another mediocre sci fi thriller Aliens We catch up with Dr Ian Malcolm Goldblum who has apparently been shunned from the scientific community for telling stories about what happened on that South American island four years ago He visits Dr John Hammond Richard Attenborough the owner and curator of the park who tells him there is another island full of dinosaurs which he is in danger of losing to either the government or poachers I couldn t really tell from all the jargon He wants Malcolm along with palentologist Dr Sarah Harding who just happens to be Malcolm s girlfriend and photographer Nick Van Owen Vaughn to go there and make sure the park is stable Of course Malcolm panics when he realizes Harding is already down there and agrees to go rescue her It s not surprising how quickly the opening act is paced This film is meant to be a special effects thrill ride so it doesn t want to waste anyone s time with a story God forbid Only the bare essentials are necessary such as Hammond s arrogant newphew Peter Ludlow Howard who constantly berates Malcolm or the fact Malcolm is a bad father to his adopted daughter The dialogue between these character is trite and blatantly foreshadowing All the characters are generic and thus Goldblum sticks out like a sore thumb since he s the only character with depth Once the main characters reach the dinosaur island the film practically becomes a remake of the original We get many shots of dinosaurs roaming the island which are impressive visually but almost boring intellectually because of the bland story It s no surprise that once a team of hunters invade the island all Hell breaks lose and the film becomes a 100 minute chase scene We get another scene of the dinosaurs pushing a vehicle off a cliff with our characters inside dangling by a thread There s more hide and seek scenes with those nasty raptors who are conviently delt with by the daughter s gymnastics talent And of course the brave mighty hunters turn into cowards and many are eaten as they flee But the film s problem isn t just the fact it repeats itself and its predecessor it s the way it does so There is no sense of satire here which means the film wants to be taken seriously which is hard to do considering how corny and contrived the screenplay is It often wanders from the main characters for large blocks of time just to show other people be eaten by the dinosaurs which is just an excuse to dodge the story and show off the effects Not to mention how badly it over doses on the cliffhangers The last act somehow shifts the setting to San Diego and much like a modern Godzilla we get a T Rex wreaking havoc there Not surprisingly the ending isn t quite resolved which could and probably will leave room for another sequel It seems like The Lost World Jurassic Park was meant to be a genuine intense thriller but it s too ridiculous to take seriously
10001,Total Recall,1990,The booming introduction music finishes and the camera sweeps over red mountains We see two figures looking over a barren and very red landscape They kiss then walk on One of the characters Schwarzenegger slips and falls The glass on his mask cracks His face scruches up and his eye s begin to pop Then Doug Quaid played by Schwarzenegger wakes up It s all been a dream He wakes up next to his beautiful wife played by Stone and the film begins TOTAL RECALL is a typical sci fi film wrapped around an intresting if far fetched plot Quaid who has never been to Mars keeps on having dreams of the planet which has now been colanised One day while riding on a train he s see s a ad for a company called Rekall which implants memories of a holiday instead of you actually going there yourself Quaid chooses the Secret Agent on Mars memory and then the s really hits the fan The implant goes wrong and Quaid really thinks he is an agent on Mars for about two minutes until he goes back to normal and can t remember a thing However everyone he knows his workmates his wife turn against him saying how blabbed about Mars and blew his cover on the mission A strange man called Richter played by Ironside wants to kill him Quaid now hopelessly confused follows the advice given to him by a friend He get s his ass to Mars Mars is ruled by Cohagen played by Cox who charges people for air Against him are the rebels who are mainly mutants The rebel s need Quaid to defeat Cohagen because Quaid knows but can t remember yet about a reactor that produces air Eventually Quaid kills Cohagen turns on the reactor saves the planet and goes away with a beautiful girl just like the guy at Rekall promised him Throughout this plot there is huge explosions thousands of deaths and I mean a LOT of death swearing sex and everything else that make s a good Verhoeven director of Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers movie Naturally there s some pretty imaginative deaths with arms getting ripped off someone getting drilled and heads exploding As you can tell it s violent stuff But it s done so stylishly and of course Arnie tones it down with a one liner that s it excusable The acting is variable Arnie of course is useless but he goes has some good lines and in the first twenty minutes he even act s like a normal bloke not like some action hero Stone of course is useless making a pretty poor wife and a pretty poor action hero But she does sex scenes alright Ticoton most recently seen in CON AIR again is OK doing some good action but getting her emotions all wrong One minute she hates Quaid the next she loves him and she never gets this tranisition right So the good guys are awful But the bad guy s are excellent Cox is basically reprising ROBOCOP but he s still great in this and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end Ironside is superbly evil with an utterly emotionless face The supporting cast are fine and not even the comedy sidekick this time in the form of a taxi driver is annoying One disappointing aspect though are the special effects ILM and Dreamquest do some good work such as a subway station scene but the model work is not so good Some of the model heads look appaling fake and Quatto is a major disappointment Another irritating thing is the product placement There are a lot of plugs and a good Mars Today gag However the sets look great and the special effects at the end of the film aren t too bad either There s also a good soundtrack running through by Jerry Goldsmith THE OMEN POLTERGEIST STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE Overall then TOTAL RECALL is a hugely violent yet hugely enjoyable action fest with a reasonable plot thrown in there too some great bad guys and some imaganitive death For a Schwarzenegger movie this is not bad at all In fact it s very good
10002,Twelve Monkeys,1995,Time travel is a fascinating confusing very complex subject That s one reason movies about time travel are in theory fascinating confusing and very complex TWELVE MONKEYS is a prime example of these attributes an excellent example In the 2020 s a date never specified but pretty conclusive James Cole Bruce Willis is an underground prisoner Yes a literal underground prisoner You see most of the Earth s population 99 to be exact was eliminated by a mysterious virus about thirty years earlier a virus that has forced the survivors to forever live in an underground hellish sanctuary Forever that is unless thru the use of unwilling volunteers they can discover the beginning of this virus and learn how to destroy it The volunteers are prisoners used like guinea pigs and thrust back in time with orders to gain information about the plague Cole is chosen by the dictator like group of scientists as a very promising candidate One problem time travel is still a shaky form of transportation and when Cole is meant to go back to November of 1996 one month before the deaths began he is instead sent to April 1990 1990 proves to be too early for Cole to gain any information about the virus Instead he is found to be insane and locked up in an institution During all this we are introduced to two crucial characters Dr Kathryn Railly Madeleine Stowe the psychiatrist in charge of Cole s evaluation and Jeffrey Goines Brad Pitt a patient in the asylum and the son of a Nobel Prize winning scientist Cole miraculously escapes the institution traveling back home to tell the scientists what he has learned which is nothing But while he s back in the 21st century we do learn that Goines is the man behind the Army of the Twelve Monkeys a militant radical group believed to spawn the virus that destroys mankind So in just a matter of minutes to us Cole is sent back this time correctly to 1996 via World War I see the movie to find out why In 1996 Cole quickly locates Railly and abducts her reminding her that she had promised six years ago to help him out Railly is a compassionate albeit frightened woman who wants to help Cole but can t be convinced of his absurd tales of time travel and apocalyptic prophesies Eventually pieces of the puzzle start falling into place just as two conflicting elements come to pass Cole begins to believe he is insane while Railly begins to believe he isn t We re almost as messed up in the head as Cole as we try to figure out who s who what s what and even when s when We don t know who to trust and we don t know what s behind a lot of things but it all starts to unravel and like a good time travel story wrap around so the beginning and ending blend into one and we re stuck in an M C Escher like mind trip TWELVE MONKEYS is an awesome flick that explores time travel with a surprisingly believable approach They re not trying to prevent the past Everything that has happened has happened and there s no changing it They are merely observing it with hopes of a better future Willis has proved himself quite a good actor with roles like this and in PULP FICTION He s good at action roles because unlike Segal and Van Damme Willis has depth not just muscles and a chiseled chin Stowe does a fine job but the real performance here is by Pitt As scrutinized as he can be Pitt is an excellent actor who caters to a variety of characters He very much deserved the Best Supporting Actor nomination he got for this role TWELVE MONKEYS isn t the light hearted time travel movie we re used to seeing This ain t no BILL TED S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE thankfully It s not a comedy but you couldn t call it an action film either It s more of a brutal psychological thriller that s so mentally captivating and intriguing that one can t help but sit wide eyed thru every scene ears perked so as not to miss a crucial bit of information Trust me there s a lot of them TWELVE MONKEYS is enjoyable enough to sit through several times In fact if you re ever going to figure out this film you just might have to Then again that s part of what makes this film so fun
10003,Ice Storm The,1997,Review by Ed Johnson Ott For more reviews go to nuvo online com and click on film Ice storms are magnificent and dangerous The outdoor world becomes a gallery of ominous wonders filled with crystalline sculptures that glisten in the winter light Of course the ice creates great hazards along with the beauty Tree limbs and power lines grow heavy and snap under the extra weight while surface areas become slick and treacherous Although ice storms are alluring most people choose to stay inside Those who elect to venture out do so with great caution But not the characters in The Ice Storm Adults hop in their cars to go for a drive on the slippery roads while children venture forth to explore One boy actually maneuvers his way onto a frozen diving board where he proceeds to bounce up and down over the concrete surface of an empty swimming pool Why Why does a group of apparently intelligent people repeatedly engage in self destructive behavior The Ice Storm succeeds because director Ang Lee doesn t tell us why Set in an affluent suburb of New Canaan Connecticut in 1973 against the backdrop of Watergate and the remnants of the 60s cultural revolution the angst filled characters play out their lives without explanation To paraphrase Lisa Simpson they are enigmas wrapped in riddles wearing polyester Lee director of Sense and Sensibility and the wonderful Eat Drink Man Woman uses the tacky fashions of the early 70s to establish the era but generally avoids playing the garish trappings for comedy His stance is that of an observer maintaining almost as much emotional distance as his characters keep between each another He uses a beautifully staged ice storm as a metaphor but leaves it to the viewer to determine exactly what aspect of human behavior the metaphor is addressing The result is disquieting and compelling images of these foolish people linger long after the movie is over The story based on Rick Moody s 1994 novel focuses on the Carvers and the Hoods upscale New Canaan families who frequently travel the wooded path between their houses Benjamin Hood Kevin Kline is the bed mate of Janey Carver Sigourney Weaver in a loveless affair Meanwhile his wife Elena Joan Allen trudges through her duties brimming with hostility but playing the role of silent martyr Jim Janey s husband is a preoccupied type who makes little impact on his family When he returns from one of his frequent business trips and cheerfully tells his boys I m back one of them replies You were gone As the tension builds between the adults their children keep busy aping their parent s behavior When not glued to her television watching the Watergate proceedings or tossing caustic remarks at her father Wendy Hood Christina Ricci pursues her sexual curiosity with both of the Carver boys moody analytical Mike Elijah Wood and his little brother Sandy Adam Hann Byrd a painfully shy kid who spends his spare moments blowing up his toys Wendy s brother Paul Tobey Maguire comes home from prep school for Thanksgiving but his focus is back at school where he vies with his roommate for the attention of a beautiful young woman With the Carvers and the Hoods it all keeps coming back to sex The New Canaan suburbanites have read about the Sexual Revolution and are determined to keep up with fashion Everything builds to a pivotal scene involving a Key Party where the men drop their car keys in a bowl At the end of the evening the wives are to fish keys from the bowl and go home with whoever owns them The camera captures all of the awkwardness of the hapless partygoers downing large amounts of liquor and bantering nervously as they strain to be on the cutting edge of sexual behavior Lee is adept at creating a vivid sense of place using numerous establishing and tracking shots to make the wistful forlorn atmosphere of New Canaan come alive When Elena looks up from a sidewalk book sale and sees her daughter riding her bike down the street you can almost feel the crispness of the autumn air Watching her daughter Elena envies Wendy s freedom and playfulness unaware that the young girl isn t feeling anything of the kind That sort of emotional misunderstanding is common in The Ice Storm The uniformly strong cast conveys the discomfort the characters feel with themselves and each other Trapped in some perceived code of behavior these people desperately want to relate to each other openly and honestly but don t have a clue how to do it so they make impulsive foolish gestures They know the danger inherent in an ice storm but can t resist the beauty so they venture out onto the slick surfaces anyway And they fall
10004,Wings of the Dove The,1997,Along comes another adaptation of a great Henry James novel the second this fall and as is the case of Washington Square which preceded it we could endlessly debate the virtues of the movie compared to those of the book One might as well compare a photograph of Pablo Picasso to a Picasso painting Aside from the fact that both bear some relationship to the artist there s not much more than the name Picasso to connect the photograph and the painting The same applies to The Wings of the Dove Don t expect a movie like this one to equate with the book The Wings of the Dove is one of the greatest novels of a writer whom many believe is one of the very best American writers perhaps the best novelist this country has ever produced In his writings Henry James explored such issues as the conflict between cultures European and American but as much as anything else his novels are about character And his nuanced descriptions of character together with the dialogue and narrative out of which his stories are built constitute the essence of his work His novels exist in the form of text yet in the reading of the text pictures emerge and are seen against the screen of the imagination which one brings to the reading With movies things are very very different The pictures predominate The director Iain Softley and the cinematographer Eduardo Serra provide the visual images out of which flow a sense of place and story And it s up to the actors by the tone and tenor of their voices body language and other visual cues as much as through lines of dialogue to suggest what is happening within All of this is supported especially in period movies like this one by costumes and sets that convey mood as well as a sense of time and place This film is highly visual from the lively street scenes of turn of the century London to the luscious interiors of English town houses and Italian canal houses and churches Of course visual images can have symbolic depth and power just as words do but they function on a different wave length altogether For example in one transition a rather scary looking medical instrument in an operating room dissolves into a soccer ball that seems to descend from the heavens into the midst of a soccer game In another scene the central characters riding in gondolas illuminated by the warm light of oil lanterns drift off into the distance and into the darkness of a Venice canal And in visual gestures such as these the contrast between life and death light and darkness reinforce what is happening within the lives of the novel s central characters Against this visually rich backdrop the novel s three central characters play their parts Kate Croy Helena Bohnam Carter the protagonist who is torn between love of journalist Merton Densher Linus Roache and her need for social and financial security the young zestful and idealistic American heiress Millie Theale Alison Elliott who is fighting for life in the midst of death These three form a classic triangle a configuration of love and hate commitment and betrayal friendship and deceit in which we see all that is both virtuous and sordid in human relationships combine and collide In this complicated and perplexing set of relationships there is some evidence of what made Henry James a great novelist James had a profound sensitivity for the moral complexity of human relationships he understood that one cannot divide the human family neatly into tribes with villains on the one side and heroes on the other He knew that both good and evil can and do reside within a single life and that for us all life is a struggle of life against death and darkness against the light I would recommend this movie for three reasons First the scenes of London and Venice are quite well done You ll want to visit Venice soon after seeing this movie Second the actors all do a very credible job with only a modest quantity of dialogue suggesting and evoking some of the more complicated themes of the novel And finally this movie will give you a number of reasons to ponder your own motives and examine your own relationships with what may be an embarrassing recognition of how closely the desire for friendship and love can be related to the need for power Four flames
10006,Sunday,1997,Starring David Suchet Lisa Harrow Jared Harris Larry Pine Joe Grifasi Arnold Barkus and Jimmy Broadway Directed by Jonathan Nossiter Running Time 93 minutes Rated R _______________________________________________________________ A man briskly meanders alongside a Queens railroad station His appearence leaves something to be desired bald overweight and despite his various items of clothing to protect from the chilly winter cold he elicits gestures that indicate heat loss in some part of his ample body Without warning a woman in her early fifties late fourties approaches him Are you Matthew De La Corta she rabidly asks with a punctuated British accent We met at a party in London she adds The woman Madeleine assumes the man she s formulating the question to is the famous English director she deeply admires Yes replies the man after a heavy pause I m Matthew But as we ve witnessed a prolific film director residing in a homeless shelter in a seedy part of the Big Apple is an impossible circumstance Oliver his actual name plays along with the woman s erroneous presumption and embarks on a journey an odyssey of love despreation jealousy pain and the other pathos of life subsequently commencing the gripping Sunday winner of the 1997 Sundance film festival and rightfully so For here we have one of the most ardently passionate visually absorbing and dramatically intriguing films of the deacde Director Jonathan Nossiter s creation will likely conclude the year as 1997 s best film As the story intensely marched on I found myself glued to my seat Experiencing Sunday produces the same enigmatic jolt similar to reading a novel by Dostoyevsky albeit the structure is different one gets the pleasurable satisfaction of seeing characters emotionally stripped down right before our eyes symbolizing class structure and frame of mind but also revealing their most intimate secrets and feelings I was exhilarated permeated into the lives of these two people a man whose labor injustices he was unexpectedly fired form IBM have led him to unfold a side of his nature that has been greatly swayed by the poor environment he inhabits a calm callous gentleman who has discovered a new way of life previously unfathomable to him and learned how to cope with it His migration from an economically stable man to a quietly desolate home less living has left him no alternative but to live life day by day abiding an unwanted existence one fears of enduring Madeleine an amiable yet dissatisfied aspiring actress who s been consistently undermined by his buffoonish and oppresive whose own life hasn t been exatly the most ideal of them all From her eyes we see this excursion into the desired and the unknown as an escape from reguliarity a testament to liberation a ballad to unadulterated detachment As written by James Lasdun and Jonathan Nossiter Sunday has the ability to be multi layered without clogging our senses whimsical yet not sentimentalizing and mystifying but not alienating us from the protagonists Nossiter s crisp cool and compelling direction is the sort of work that won Shine s Scott Hicks his first Oscar Nomination And if that happening doesn t occur to Nossiter and the film I will dismiss the March event Here is a film shot in an equally meager budget as Chasing Amy and In The Company of Men surpassing them both in the optical and scriptwriting departments The two leads are nothing short of superb Suchet last seen in the big budget techno thriller Executive Decision conveys the sense of loss from an everyday man with extreme restraint He doesn t indulge in sorrow but he prudently indicates us to symphatize with him as we contemplate his dead end and how he functions around it And it appears Oliver is prone to live his life as a journeyman one day at a time omitting the anguish that naturally arises Madeleine played magnificently by Lisa Harrow fleshes out hewr character in an extremely convincing fashion Madeleine is in better shape than Oliver but surprisingly much more desperate and eager about her fate representing that at one juncture money becomes irrelevant as to who you are Harrow allows us to penetrate into her torture wonderfully But Sunday s perceptiveness extends to much more than that We are immersed into the lives of Oliver s homeless fellows how the Big Apple perceives them and we are there to understand what they live through In one wonderful scene we observe a scrawny fella who also convives eith Oliver in the shleter with a deep penetrating glare he stares at the legs of a woman he cannot see Nossiter focuses the camera solely on her thighs giving birth to what this man s sense of lust the absence of her face acknowledges how vagrant folks have been fogotten by standard society As the credits of Sunday rolled I remained calm in my seat recollecting the situations and glares of the characters admiring the power the impeccable narrative and remembering the visually arresting New York s texture has rarely been captured so well sites Nossiter surrenders Sunday is a true illustration of authentic movie magic
10007,Romy and Micheles High School Reunion,1997,ROMY AND MICHELE S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION I ve got a couple more years until my ten year high school reunion I therefore have that much time to lose fifteen pounds make twenty million dollars become famous and marry Sandra Bullock But let s face it I d be lucky just to lose the weight Movies made about high school reunions are very sympathetic toward this predicament The plot is pretty much always the same The main characters get an invitation to their ten year reunion and realize that they are not what they wanted to be by this time They make up an elaborate ruse to fool people into thinking they are more successful than they really are only to have their cover blown at the reunion itself causing significant shame However through a process of learning that certain other classmates are also not doctors lawyers corporate heads or movie stars while still others who have achieved success are not leading the fantasy life they thought they would our heroes find that just by being happy they are success stories after all ROMY AND MICHELE S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION follows this formula to a tee Romy Mira Sorvino and Michele Lisa Kudrow are friends who have stayed together since high school having moved from their hometown of Tucson Arizona to Venice Beach California Romy is a cashier at the service department of the local Jaguar dealership while Michele is one of California s gainfully unemployed They find out through a classmate Janeane Garafolo that their reunion is a couple of weeks away and while filling in an informational survey for the event realize that they have not come nearly as far as they had expected After failed attempts to lose weight how much more stick thin could they get and find good jobs and dreamy boyfriends they hatch a scheme to show everyone up by agreeing to pretend to be successful businesswomen From the beginning of the film Romy and Michele are so full of themselves and their appearances I thought I was watching a movie about the reunion for the high school class from CLUELESS Needless to say I didn t start viewing this movie caring for the characters very much at all Romy and Michele are quite simply annoying with annoying ways of talking and annoying little laughs We only start identifying with them as protagonists because we find out through a series of high school flashbacks that there were other students even more self absorbed than them Once that is made plain the two women become a little more likable The film does a good job of characterizing some of the cliques which comprise the teen social strata and it s fun to watch them on screen There s the A Group made up of the debutantes and the handsome jocks the B Group comprised of the drama people the C group consisting of your various kinds of nerds and then there are your loners The representation of each group is pushed just the right amount over the top so you can have a nice laugh reminiscing Too much would have made them utterly ridiculous and unidentifiable Too little would have probably caused horrifying flashbacks of your own Romy and Michele decide they don t quite fit into any of those groups but I d say airhead transcends many categories As astonishing as it is there is actually some decent character development By the end of the movie the two women not only find out something about themselves which is always the case is this formula but also about each other Take for example their plot to tell everyone at the reunion that they developed Post It Notes as a team Michele is horrified to learn that Romy doesn t think anyone would believe that Michele would do more than suggest they make the notes yellow You re more of a design person she tells Michele implying that she doesn t have the brains to do much more than express feelings To the credit of screenwriter Robin Schiff the conflict between the two friends is not suddenly laid in our laps to give us drama at the right point Instead the first allusions to a possible falling out occur shortly after they find out about the reunion and it builds from there This not only fleshes out the characters in a more believable way but also results in a nice way of showing how reunions can bring out the worst in everyone Mira Sorvino does a competent job playing Romy who is annoying and vacuous but not completely hopeless Lisa Kudrow is basically playing the character she plays on Friends but for an hour and a half She is definitely the heir apparent to the ditz queen title previously held by the likes of Goldie Hawn and Teri Garr Janeane Garafolo is the one who really steals the show as the highly successful but mean spirited classmate who s spite is indiscriminate Unlike the A Group she is just mean to everybody and her interactions with other characters is absolutely hilarious Although she s not on camera for much of the film any more screen time would have seen diminishing marginal returns True to formula the reunion goes exactly as you d expect You re given a message about human nature and society and you take it with a grain of salt I suppose it s because so many of us have faced or will be faced with a situation similar to Romy and Michele s that by the end of the film you re actually hoping things will work out for those who deserve it even though you know they will That s in the formula too you know
10009,4 Little Girls,1997,Ingredients black and white photos interviews with people tight close up shots of faces Governor George Wallace standing in a school doorway Synopsis This documentary explores the senseless bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Alabama on September 15 1963 which cut short the lives of four children attending Sunday school Addie Mae Collins 14 Carole Denise McNair 11 Cynthia Wesley 14 and Carole Rosamond Robertson 14 The bombing was a defining moment in the civil rights movement because it awakened Americans to the real nature and ultimate perversity of racist hatred Interviews with people such as Walter Cronkite George Wallace Coretta Scott King civil rights leaders the former Mayor of Birmingham and clergy are interspersed with photos and film clips that locate the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church within the context of the heated battle for racial integration which was occurring in Birmingham Alabama at that time But the meat of the story is the memories of the friends and family of the four slain girls They re all older now and we get to watch them during the interviews as they think back and explain things Of course some details are crystal clear and forever remembered while others are fuzzy or lost in time At one point a mother stops and shows us her daughter s doll collection which she has faithfully kept pristine for over thirty years Another person says with difficulty It s not easy Because we had put so much of this behind us Opinion In some documentaries history is examined without emotion as if it happened in limbo to people we don t know to people who wear black and white clothing on grainy film Not in this documentary In 4 Little Girls Spike Lee foregoes dramatization or chronology and instead opts to do this material as a set of interviews showing the plain and simple or even contradictory truth the way people remember it As real flesh and blood folks ramble on about the people and events of Birmingham in the 1960s the camera allows us to watch every unconscious tick of the muscles on their faces including the parents and siblings determined efforts to keep a stiff upper lip and hold back tears Through this documentary Spike Lee reminds us that history is neither impartial nor located in the past History is today living life as we live it
1001,Bakenbardy,1990,Synopsis A medium sized Soviet city is plagued by a youth gang that resembles Western punks A traditionalist organizes another group the Alexander Pushkin Appreciation Society to combat the punks A satire of Soviet society and the effects of Perestroika this film resembles a movie version of a Monty Python historical sketch Outrageously funny U S S R English subtitles color 1990 100 minutes Director Yuri Mamin The time is the present A medium sized Soviet city is plagued by a gang of college aged youth the Capellas They look and act like Western punks they hold wild parties in a disco their women expose their bare breasts in public and they engage in other types of openly decadent behavior They are opposed by another gang the Bashers who are rednecks and body builders Into this social turmoil come two young men dressed in rather formal clothes black dress pants white shirts black capes hats and canes They worship Alexander Pushkin a Russian literary figure who lived around 1800 They despise the decadence of the Capellas and organize the Bashers into a Pushkin gang dressing them in the uniform they wear i e they all dress like Pushkin They train in the use of the cane as a martial art in a hilarious scene reminiscent of those group calisthenics scenes that are obligatory in a kung fu movie One night the Pushkin gang attacks the Capellas and runs them out of town This pleases the city s residents very much The story continues as the gang is certified as an official youth organization They grow in membership and power and evolve into a para military organization This film is a nice satire of current trends in Soviet society The Pushkin cult is clearly a cult of personality similar to the personality cults the Soviet government has forced on its citizens in the past This point is underscored when the cult members go around town taking down the large red government banners with their stupid socialist slogans replacing them with large white banners with quotations from Pushkin As the Pushkin cult grows from a small gang to an official youth organization to a large organization with a merchandising wing it becomes increasingly more militaristic and totalitarian The growth of the cult is an example of one of the dangers of increasing freedom in the USSR namely that new forms of totalitarianism may arise to take the place of the old totalitarianism of Communism Indeed by presenting a totalitarian organization based on an 1800 s literary figure the film suggests that the roots of totalitarianism are old and firmly established in Soviet society and the Soviet psyche Reportedly the film has had only limited screenings in the USSR probably as a result of the fact that it links personality cults with the emergence of new forms of totalitarianism Although the work has clear political overtones and an important message you do not need to appreciate that to enjoy the movie The idea that literary figures form the basis for large totalitarian personality cults is so silly that the film is really very funny Also the film doesn t take itself very seriously as it is intended to be a satire The silliness makes the film resemble a movie length version of a Monty Python style historical sketch Because of the great humor in the film I recommend it to a general audience strongly recommended to fans of satire and Monty Python style humor Print Source Lenfilm Golos 10 Kirovsky Prospekt Leningrad USSR
10010,Flubber,1997,FLUBBER Disney Directed by Les Mayfield In The Time Machine the passive docile Eloi were lured to their deathes at the paws of the man eating Morlocks by huge sirens that emerged from the Morlocks underground lair Similarly families are summoned into movie theatres at least twice a year by the almost irresistible call of the Disney marketing machine How can anyone with children be expected to withstand the non stop barrage of ads tie ins and merchandising that accompanies every major Disney production To make matters worse Disney has lately taken to remaking well remembered titles of the past such as 101 Dalmatians and That Darn Cat which throws baby boomer nostalgia into the equation and makes the sales pitch even tougher to resist for the over 30 demographic Flubber for instance is an update of The Absent Minded Professor the 1961 Fred McMurray comedy about an awkward scientist who discovers a kind of flying rubber that allows objects cars and basketball players to rise to new heights Changing the title to focus on the substance instead of the man who discovers it is a indicator not only of how Flubber differs from its source but also of what sets these newly minted Disneys apart from the movies that inspired them Flubber features some inspired visual effects and state of the art computer animation but it s a singularly joyless experience to sit through as technology once again trumps any kind of human interest Actually after Hook and Jumanji Robin Williams ought to know better than to attach himself to family entertainment but perhaps after the disaster of Father s Day earlier this year he figured Flubber might restore a bit of his luster Sadly not Director Les Mayfield has no idea what to do with Williams aside from reining him in always the worst way to handle such a volatile talent Not that Mayfield gets decent performances out of such reputable actors as Marcia Gay Harden or Christopher McDonald either Almost everyone in the cast seems to realize they re here purely to kill time between special effects sequences and the tiresome slapsticky antics served up by screenwriter John Hughes Ever since his grand slam with the original Home Alone Hughes has given up on writing about human beings and concentrated solely on rehashing his biggest hit Flubber is no exception to the rule as Hughes works in a pair of moronic henchmen Clancy Brown Ted Levine who must endure multiple unfunny pratfalls while trying to steal Flubber For no reason other than to offer one more reminder of Home the bad guys are often observed by a little boy who s a rather obvious clone of Macaulay Culkin and does a lot of screaming to prove it Hughes teen romances of ten years ago Pretty in Pink Some Kind of Wonderful etc had more depth than his playing out of the love triangle between Williams Harden and McDonald to make matters worse there s also a chatty flying computer on the sidelines who keeps trying to distract Williams from matters of the heart At one point this horny little love machine conjures up a holographic vixen to seduce the professor a rather kinky departure for Disney fare and needless to say an undeveloped idea Of course it s doubtful that Flubber s low quality will have much of an effect on its box office performance Jumanji was every bit as unimaginative and mean spirited and it still grossed over 100 million It s hard not to feel sorry though for the too trusting Moms and Dads who ll round up their broods and trudge to the multiplex to see this piece of product masquerading as a movie Chances are they ll have a better time looking for a parking space or waiting in line at the concession stand than they will watching Flubber James Sanford
10011,Alien: Resurrection,1997,ALIEN RESURRECTION Twentieth Century Fox Directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet Chances are good that many of the moviegoers who ll be stand in line for Alien Resurrection this weekend weren t even born when the original Alien debuted in the summer of 1979 introducing the world to Ripley one of the most dynamic and determined heroines ever to appear in science fiction Eighteen years later she s still being played by Sigourney Weaver and the most intriguing aspect of Resurrection is the way Josh Wheadon s screenplay allows Weaver the opportunity to overhaul Ripley somewhat After all when we last saw her she was plunging to her death to avoid giving birth to a new Alien queen by the time Resurrection opens approximately 200 years later scientists have successfully cloned Ripley after seven botched tries from DNA samples But their motives are hardly humanitarian Indeed when we first see Ripley she s in the process of undergoing a kind of Caesarian section having the unborn baby queen removed from her chest From this specimen General Perez Dan Hedaya spectulates science can learn about all facets of the alien and possibly even find a way in which to tame them As far as I m concerned Number Eight is a meat by product says Perez of Ripley who in this new incarnation is stronger and stranger than ever before Her senses are alarmingly acute and though she looks human her blood now sizzles when it s spilled After Perez s ship is visited by the crew of a freighter called The Betty Alien Resurrection takes a more familiar turn as the alien specimens escape and run amok decimating the human population Call Winona Ryder the least off putting of The Betty team realizes that everyone needs Ripley s help to survive but at the same time Call isn t sure this genetic superwoman is really trustworthy After all who knows how human she really is Director Jean Pierre Jeunet best known for the cult fave The City of Lost Children manages a stylish mix of arresting imagery and largely non stop action In one of the film s best shots Jeunet s camera swoops into the mouth of a screaming man and travels down his throat and into his chest to reveal the gaping jaws of the alien fetus inside of him and Internet addicts will enjoy Jeunet s visualization of the future of computer interfacing which looks like a cross between religion and heroin use Jeunet and Wheadon also handle the story s quieter moments with equal finesse the eerie encounter between Ripley and her failed forerunners is one of the finest most chilling sequences in any of the Alien films Weaver perhaps inspired by the new kinks in Ripley s character seems much livelier and more vigorous than she did in the so so Alien 3 and there are flashes of surprising humor in her exchanges with Call who Ryder underplays effectively Michael Wincott and Ron Perlman contribute the requisite grit as Call s uncouth co workers and Brad Dourif s nutty take on the chief scientist is quite amusing Though Alien Resurrection can t entirely sidestep the feeling of deja vu that hangs over most sequels and ultimately wraps up with a climax that s less exciting than most of the rest of the picture it s a perfectly respectable sequel crafted with a certain degree of imagination and produced with some of the finest special effects money can buy If it doesn t have the novelty value of the original or the relentless suspense of James Cameron s Aliens 1986 Resurrection is still a swift rewarding shocker in its own right James Sanford
10012,4 Little Girls,1997,On the morning of September 15 1963 as Sunday School was in session at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Alabama an explosion rang out Long time racially motivated bomber Robert Dynamite Bob Chambliss and a band of his followers had planted a bomb in that church with the intent of inflicting maximum damage The civil rights marches were in full swing in the south and so were the counterinsurgents These mad bombers that day killed Addie Mae Collins 14 Carol Denise McNair 11 Cynthia Wesley 14 and Carole Rosamond Robertson 14 While Spike Lee was still in film school he began to plan a movie about the bombing Over a decade later he has finally been able to deliver on his dream with a documentary which he calls simply 4 LITTLE GIRLS to tell the tragedy of those children s early death Spike Lee s publicist sent me an unsolicited press video with the goal of fostering knowledge of the film and building demand that it be shown more widely than it has been those far Even though it has gotten rave reviews it has only played in 9 major markets in the United States missing the Silicon Valley and many other regions of the country All of the revenue earned from the theatrical release of the film is being donated to a memorial fund for the 4 girls From Spike Lee s very first movie SHE S GOTTA HAVE IT he has demonstrated fresh and interesting approaches to standard material Although his DO THE RIGHT THING for which he won an Academy Award for the writing is arguably his best known film his picture MALCOLM X staring Denzel Washington remains my personal favorite Spike Lee s first documentary 4 LITTLE GIRLS certainly ranks among his best films At the time of the bombing Birmingham was a steel town with a long history of labor violence In one part of the historic film footage in the movie the Rev Martin Luther King calls Birmingham the most segregated city in America Although much of the South by 1963 had begun to remove some of the more blatant examples of racism Birmingham still had separate white and colored sections for lunch counters cabs restrooms water fountains movie seats bus seats etc ad nauseam The Commissioner of Public Safety what a misnomer was the infamous Bull Connor Bull was fond of using dogs billy clubs fire hoses and even a tank to maintain racial order These white and colored signs were not to be treated lightly Describing this era of insanity the parents of the slain girls tell their stories in retrospective Denise s father Christopher McNair talks about Denise s childhood His most vivid and moving recollection is a simple story of woe when he had to tell his hungry daughter that he could not buy her a sandwich because the lunch counter at that store was for whites only and it did not have one for coloreds It was a time when the moderate whites in Birmingham were just beginning to assert themselves When a picture of white Birmingham hooligans beating a freedom rider made the front pages of newspapers worldwide local Birmingham businessmen saw it in a newspaper in Tokyo and said that something had to be done The film does not ascribe any subsequent actions to these good intentions I say segregation now segregation tomorrow and segregation forever were the notorious words said by Governor George Wallace in his inauguration address that year From that scandalous scene Lee cuts to today where an invalid Wallace points to a black man named Al who he says is his best friend and who travels with him all over the globe Wallace claims that when he was governor he provided free textbooks for black students In contemporary interviews with African Americans they express doubts that Wallace ever believed his racist rhetoric They said he was the nicest person you d ever want to meet until the cameras were turned on him and then his inflammatory rhetoric was an expedient Starting small but expanding rapidly the civil rights protests in Birmingham grew into something that threatened the white power structure The reaction by Bull and his crew was swift and predictable The protesters were put in jail with hardened prisoners and even little kids went to jail The big event for the movement was the tragedy of the death of the 4 little girls Their funeral was packed with mourners and reporters from all over the world who descended on the town to cover their burial As Walter Cronkite put it This was the awakening for white America The movie ends with Chambliss s trial a decade and a half after his sickening deed Still laughing at the cameras he is convinced that he will escape punishment The film would have been better served with more details of the trial particularly the investigation leading up to it Also too much footage is devoted to names like Bill Cosby and Ozzie Davis who show up mainly to add star power to the picture These however are minor quibbles Lee s powerful film works best in the stock footage from the past for no words can adequately describe what happened then From images as simple as two drinking fountains one labeled white and one labeled colored to ones as dramatic as a church in rubbles the film shocks the viewers with their country s own history 4 LITTLE GIRLS runs 1 42 The film is not rated but would be PG for mature themes The picture would be fine for any child old enough to be interested in its subject matter
10013,Fatherland,,As in many a mystery the journalist is handed a picture by a mysterious stranger In the old photo is a group of unknown people brought together during a key moment in WWII What has happened to these people since and what is the relevance of this photograph Although this outline is standard issue the circumstances surrounding it are not The book Fatherland is a taut thriller and author Robert Harris s first novel I read this engrossing tale on vacation a few years back and thought at the time that a wonderful motion picture could be made from it Although the script by Ron Hutchinson and Stanley Weiser borrows liberally from the novel usually reliable director Christopher Menaul Prime Suspect 1 and FEAST OF JULY manages to excise much of the suspense Most of the key events from the novel are there but in the 1994 film FATHERLAND they are laid before the viewer devoid of much of the energy and emotion present in the novel The story is set in the mid 1960s in a Europe renamed Germania and controlled by Adolf Hitler Hitler has essentially won the war with a stalemated peace even if the US never signed a treaty and the war on the Eastern front with Russia drags on ad infinitum The US led by President Joseph P Kennedy has begun to make some peace overtones to Germania For the first time since before the war Germania is letting American journalists into the country since Germania is celebrating Hitler s 75th birthday All however is not well in the National Socialists world The knowledge of the Holocaust is limited to a few high ranking Germans Into this carefully contrived calm comes a murder of a high ranking member of the SS With the body found in a lake an SS police officer Major Xavier March is sent to investigate According to his dossier the dead man turns out to have been an architect of the Jewish resettlement program and even designed certain new efficiencies in the program The Germans and the world believe that the Jews were resettled to the Eastern front With the war with Russia dragging on forever who could check the story s accuracy anyway Rutger Hauer who specializes of late in over the top performances is remarkably subtle this time as Major Xavier March March is one of the few good Nazis an officer whose bulky uniform seems to hang on him heavily and awkwardly now The Major is a veteran detective member of the SS who has grown tired of the Nazis When his son gives the Nazi youth pledge to Hitler at mealtime March suggests they say grace instead like they used to His son Dili is a well scrubbed and naive member of the Hitler youth movement Rory Jennings plays Dili as an automaton who shows little emotion at times when any human being would have had to be significantly affected The simple murder gets more complicated when General Globus John Shrapnel the head of the Gestapo is found to have been at the scene Soon a cover up is afoot and March is taken off the case Miranda Richarson plays an American journalist named Charlie Maguire who was originally born in Germany but who left as a little girl She is passed the mysterious and incriminating photos by a stranger along with a cryptic note to see someone to find out more about the picture s background In delicious bit of casting against type Jean Marsh shows up briefly as a creepy old German actress who blames her lack of success in America on those Jews who run the studios The book spent more time on the detective work whereas the movie devotes too much time to establishing Hauer s good Nazi credentials And while the book kept the reader on the edge of the chair the movie s laconic pacing and unhurried staging robs the story of its threatening immediacy The movie makes everything too predictable but the book had the gift of making the obvious surprising A gripping and lucid book is thus transformed into a confusing and slow movie that is populated with a remarkably tame group of Nazis with little visible anger Even the Gestapo with the exception of their sinister hats don t seem to be a particularly bad lot New York City cops are usually portrayed as more vicious by the movies Still the fascinating underlying plot and Hauer s moving performance ultimately save the picture but just barely FATHERLAND runs 1 48 It is rated PG 13 for brief nudity some violence and a few pictures of concentration camp victims The film would be fine for kids age 12 and up

10016,Boogie Nights,1997,Note Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers Be forewarned Like its own opening shot from out of the darkness BOOGIE NIGHTS triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer Paul Thomas Anderson as a bonafide major talent A sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry BOOGIE NIGHTS is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking The film follows a soft spoken young man Eddie Adams Mark Wahlberg from Torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom and later to a harrowingly precipitous drop As BOOGIE NIGHTS opens he s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy San Fernando Valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity Recruited by fatherly Jack Horner a rejuvenated Burt Reynolds a successful porn filmmaker Eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as Dirk Diggler pornstar Wholeheartedly embraced by Jack s troupe including the maternal Amber Waves Julianne Moore Reed Rothchild John C Reilly Buck Swope Don Cheadle Rollergirl Heather Graham Dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled to the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being a big bright shining star His lack of discipline however incites a chain of circumstances which sees Dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in The element of BOOGIE NIGHTS which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by Mr Anderson whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious From the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool Mr Anderson s accomplished command of the camera is without question While novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating impertinent and self congratulatory case in point Marc Rocco s unforgettable perpetual motion helming of MURDER IN THE FIRST in BOOGIE NIGHTS every zoom or pan by Mr Anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent It s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker s career BOOGIE NIGHTS is only his second feature film following up his debut feature from earlier this year HARD EIGHT and although it s somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of Robert Altman while in terms of visuals he s clearly influenced by Martin Scorsese at least he s borrowing from some of the best and it s entirely effective within the context of this film While BOOGIE NIGHTS is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value it s also rollicking good fun with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour The film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by Bob Ziembicki and costume design by Mark Bridges and BOOGIE NIGHTS convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent pre AIDS scare period in American history where uninhibited free wheeling lifestyles abounded While much of the film s humour pertains to the characters obliviousness of now outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society a prime example is part time salesman Buck Swope s demo of a stereo system with an eight track tape and inviting a prospective customer to get freaky deaky with the music it s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous A giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny to be sure but oddly magical and the sequence which lovingly explores Eddie Dirk s bedroom completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures Farrah Fawcett Cheryl Tiegs Bruce Lee is breathtaking Ably supported by a well selected collection of period music all of which purportedly came straight from Mr Anderson s personal collection there s a clear affection for the era in BOOGIE NIGHTS It s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of BOOGIE NIGHTS which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the film s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters After the debacle with 1996 s Milos Forman film THE PEOPLE VS LARRY FLYNT another finely crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography related storyline the New Line marketing team faced a unique challenge with BOOGIE NIGHTS in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public However while BOOGIE NIGHTS delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago it s hardly a lurid or seamy film given the subject matter there s very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and BOOGIE NIGHTS smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality but simply as a business The glimpses on the sets of Jack Horner s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate there s a candid matter of factness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job and it s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided If anything BOOGIE NIGHTS is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves Jack Horner s dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires to make a great film and to some degree BOOGIE NIGHTS is reminiscent of ED WOOD albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence In both films the world of quickie low budget filmmaking is explored and both Jack Horner and the version of Ed Wood by Tim Burton Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski share similar mindsets Jack s retort of There are shadows in light baby to his cinematographer s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to Ed Wood s It s not about the little details it s about the big picture rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE appears patently false In BOOGIE NIGHTS and ED WOOD the aspirations of the respective filmmakers prove to be bemusing not in their intentions there s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an artistic erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark Much like the humour lacing ED WOOD the laughs involving Jack Horner are double edged after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the James Bond and porn genres when Jack breathes This is the best work I ve ever done it s genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses a tinge of sadness Mr Anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter While BOOGIE NIGHTS shows great inventiveness in staging there really isn t any clever dialogue in the film though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the film s protagonist literally doesn t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time it s no wonder why the playfully inane How much can you bench banter between Dirk and Reed constitutes one of the film s finest exchanges And while Mr Anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters it s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film s characters are simply stale material Julianne Moore s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for a less risque and uninspired TV movie version of her character s story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions Still even if he doesn t always know what to do with his characters Mr Anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive self destructive insufferable I loved them just the same In any case it s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately best executed scenes of the year a scene where Dirk Diggler and Reed Rothchild are dragged along by their loose cannon compadre to the home of drug baron Rahad Jackson a mesmerizing Alfred Molina in an unforgettable performance even if it s a small one in a suicidal drug deal scam only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of Night Ranger s Sister Christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked by an armed bodyguard If this scene already wasn t tense enough with these elements Mr Anderson introduces a Chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene to a new surreal level of delightful giddiness There are some other interesting touches in BOOGIE NIGHTS Mr Anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from HARD EIGHT here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect Similarly a painful scene where crew member Scotty J Philip Seymour Hoffman breaks down in tears in the driver s seat sobbing I m so stupid after being rebuffed by Dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with Dirk in the driver s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening BOOGIE NIGHTS is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise to the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good While most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to Mr Wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and Mr Reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film ringing true in every respect a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention Mr Reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in Ulu Grosbard s GEORGIA a genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in BOOGIE NIGHTS are among the very funniest in the film I m not sure how much of his performance as Reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee Mr Reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and it s wickedly funny to watch his Reed join in with Dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation Worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the Dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad and dead on period it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me demo track You Got The Touch in a vain attempt at a musical career Mr Reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective Ms Graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like a Disney animated heroine come to life or in this case a Disney animated heroine who came to life made a wrong turn and ended up on the New Line lot in a film focused on the late 70s early 80s adult film industry Consequently it s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in a scene where she s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera a hilariously pouty come hither look all one can do is gulp Her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out err in a figurative sense she s essentially a glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity If only Mr Anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though And a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as a teen Ms Graham s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic HEATHERS since then her most notable roles have been as a junkie Gus Van Sant s DRUGSTORE COWBOY and now a porn starlet Draw your own conclusions Perhaps the most quietly touching performance in BOOGIE NIGHTS is that of Mr Cheadle who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion His relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife Jessie St Vincent an interesting Melora Walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible it s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry While the scenario is familiar the wounded look in Cheadle s eyes makes the scene unforgettable Luis Guzman s most famous work is possibly in Brian De Palma s CARLITO S WAY and here he plays a variation on the same character Maurice T Rodriguez is a hapless but good natured nightclub owner who s a hanger on to Jack s group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding Jack with little disguise made of his desperation for a part in one of his erotic pictures Jack s eventual acquiescence to Maurice s request leads to one of BOOGIE NIGHTS biggest comic payoffs BOOGIE NIGHTS is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by Mr Anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work Striking a fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally well crafted there s no doubt that BOOGIE NIGHTS is among the very best films of the year
10017,Devils Advocate The,1997,THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE Warner Bros 1997 Starring Keanu Reeves Al Pacino Charlize Theron Jeffrey Jones Judith Ivey Connie Neilsen Craig T Nelson Screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman Produced by Arnold Kopelson Anne Kopelson Arnon Milchan Directed by Taylor Hackford Running time 144 minutes Note Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers Be forewarned Given current popular sentiment it s almost a cliche to depict lawyers as the underlings of Satan but such is the case in Taylor Hackford s THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE a delightfully glorious romp that begins with a simmer and culminates with a devastatingly impudent climax only to ultimately boil over with a disappointingly unsatisfying conclusion The protagonist of THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE is young defense attorney Kevin Lomax Keanu Reeves who seems to have everything going for him at the film s opening a beautiful wife Mary Ann Charlize Theron and perhaps most importantly from his perspective a thriving and successful practice Kevin s courtroom record is unblemished and it doesn t take long to understand why in an audaciously funny opening sequence which sees him defending a schoolteacher charged with molestation As victimized schoolgirl Barbara Heather Matarazzo perfectly cast as the hapless awkward witness I kept waiting for the jury to burst into a spontaneous chorus of Wiener Dog recounts her accusation any question Kevin may have of his client s innocence vaporizes when the defendant virtually salivates in arousement at her tale Nonetheless Kevin puts aside any moral qualms to ruthlessly cross examine Barbara and ultimately win his client s acquittal Kevin s good but there s only so far he s going to go in Gainesville Florida Fortunately a bigger fish has been keeping a watchful eye on his progress and soon enough Kevin is lured by a flatteringly generous offer and lushly exorbitant new Fifth Avenue digs to New York where he joins the powerful firm of Milton Chadwick and Waters Falling under the wing of enigmatic senior partner John Milton Al Pacino Kevin is put on the fast track to the top with a series of difficult and intriguing defense cases and becomes single mindedly devoted to his work oblivious of Mary Ann s slow meltdown Although it s not explicitly revealed until the end of THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE it s quite apparent from the outset and the promotional trailers for the film make no attempts to hide this fact that Milton is the Devil Even Milton himself performs little subterfuge to disguise his alter ego continually emphasizing his demonic qualities with his wild eyed stares and gleeful looks I particularly liked the scene in the restaurant where he adjusted his dress shirt collar up to resemble the traditional devil s cloak While in this respect THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE is fun in its recklessness I wonder how the film would have played out had it been more coy with its machinations Due not only to the promotion of the film but of the horrific hallucinations undergone by Mary Ann relatively early on there s no real sense of intrigue and no involvement required in order to decipher what s occurring in the film it s simply nothing more than a thrill ride As the conclusion of THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE nears only Kevin is in the dark with respect to Milton s true nature and his ignorance comes across more as incredulous than sympathetic Still Mr Pacino makes the devilish role his own and this is a terrific piece of casting for THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE While a few actors come to mind as possessing the sort of look and acting chops to portray the Prince of Darkness Jack Nicholson for one and I could certainly envision a demonic Jeremy Irons Mr Pacino is perfect in the part because he makes The Devil so much for lack of a better word fun This is the perfect outlet for the scenery chewing which has been plaguing many of his recent performances here such an over the top approach is entertainingly beneficial as opposed to a hindrance By the end of the film I was basking in wicked delight at Milton s unrestrained theatrical rants and blasphemously rooting as much for Mr Pacino s witty Antichrist as I was for Mr Reeves bland hero Mr Pacino seems to relish every minute of his role and delves into the part with great enthusiasm He s way over the top with his now customary bellowing grandiose gestures and plenty of demonic grins galore while Mr Reeves despite a Southern accent which wavers into every third reel and then abruptly disappears does some of the best work I ve ever seen from him His physical performance severely outclasses his line delivery he often recites his dialogue with distractingly little conviction but he s not a liability here Ms Theron s attempt at a Southern accent is far better particularly considering she s from South Africa but it s disappointing that she s saddled with such a generic and uninteresting role the obligatory wife who cries neglect although at least in THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE she gets to combine this with the person in the know staple She often has a startling resemblance to Ashley Judd which is perhaps emphasized all the more in that her performance in the film echoes back to some of Ms Judd s earlier work Ms Theron s scene in a church is eerily similar to Ms Judd in NORMA JEAN MARILYN while Ms Theron s portrayal of her character s breakdown is brings back memories of Ms Judd s emotional volatility in John McNaughton s NORMAL LIFE Judith Ivey s role as Kevin s mother is even more frustratingly generic a bible thumper whose purpose it is to serve on the polar opposite axis to all of the film s demonic aspects You dread her solemn recitation of some gravely worded scripture referenced warning because you know she s ultimately going to be proven correct Still as insufferable as her character is it s worth it for a deliciously funny scene where Mrs Lomax and Milton awkwardly share an elevator ride THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE builds up to a wonderful if excessively visually extravagant conclusion which is deliriously operatic in nature and genuine high camp in style I was stunned and thrilled by the sheer fearless temerity of the film s climax no American film had delivered such a similarly nihilistic knockout blow which left me as thunderstruck since David Fincher s SE7EN so I was consequently crestfallen that the film badly drops the ball and kicks it away with a final coda which can only be classified as condescending and absurd After teasing at a provocative and daring conclusion THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE buckles under and provides an epilogue which lacks a fraction of the bite Technically THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE is terrific to look at Andrzej Bartkowiak s cinematography is superb and the much ballyhooed production design by Bruno Rubeo is extremely impressive from the spectacular rooftop scene to the inventive design of Milton s office The film is cast remarkably well although I d have liked to see Delroy Lindo curiously unbilled as a animal sacrificing voodoo practitioner whom Kevin defends and Craig T Nelson as Alexander Cullen a smarmy real estate tycoon whom Kevin defends on a murder charge swap roles Mr Hackford s helming on THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE is generally solid although the film s build up is a bit too long There are too many scenes which involve Mary Ann complaining about neglect and Kevin defending himself and a sequence where Jeffrey Jones Eddie Barzoon character on the run from Milton is particularly ineffective given that his fate is a foregone conclusion Mr Hackford also goes a bit overboard with the use of time lapse photography to generate an ominous atmosphere showing days and nights on each other s heels as storm clouds zip through the sky Once or twice is enough but after this technique is reused over and over I felt like I was watching a 7th grade science class film and was hoping that he might insert time lapse footage of a seedling sprouting from the earth and blooming into a flower or something of that sort All the same THE DEVIL S ADVOCATE is good fun for the most part and it s highly amusing to watch Mr Pacino run rampant in a film which provides the proper context for his unbridled theatrics There s a scene where alluring Christabella Connie Nielsen interrupts a gleeful Milton rant with an unamused Shut up You talk too much What and lose the most entertaining element of the film
10018,Amadeus,1984,There is an excruciatingly fine line between madman and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart seemed to dance along that line like a tightrope walker at a three ring circus AMADEUS thrills it s audience with an excellent interpretation of both sides of one of the greatest composers the world has ever known After a suicide attempt Antonio Salieri F Murray Abraham in an Academy Award winning role winds up in a mental institution Once the court composer for Emperor Joseph II Jeffrey Jones it is in this institution that the story of AMADEUS is related by Salieri to a priest He tells how his jealousy for Mozart Tom Hulce led to a disdain for God the God who put the passion but not the talent inside of him He tells how his own cravings for what Mozart possessed led to his and Mozart s demise AMADEUS is a look at Salieri and the insane jealousy he held for Mozart From the time he was a little boy music consumed Salieri s soul He wanted nothing more than to be a legacy in the musical world a genius whose name would live on forever synonymous with great music Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart seemed to ruin all that for him Mozart s musical masterpieces tortured Salieri s own shortcomings Salieri watched in silent rage as Mozart went on to do all the things he dreamed to do He watched as his own work was mocked by the irreverent Mozart Eventually it would be the passion that these two shared that would bring the downfall of each There isn t much more of a plot than that It s simply a biographical film that s just as much about Salieri as it is about Mozart What makes this film so great isn t the story line so much as the perfection in it s presentation Abraham and Hulce are both brilliant the costumes are fantastic and the emotional involvement is surprisingly rich Never would you suspect that Mozart was such a comical improper yet intellectual being This is also a wonderful lesson in classical music as we get a hefty does of Mozart s work Then there is one of the final scenes On his deathbed Mozart dictates the music in his head to Salieri Words can not describe how perfect this scene is The way it portrays Mozart s genius is ingenious It is so well done that I would sit through this movie over and over again just to see it It s truly one of the most brilliant most moving and well done pieces of film I have ever seen Sometimes it is just as hard to say why a film should get four stars as it is to say why it shouldn t A lot of times it s just a matter of the way it makes you feel While AMADEUS at times moved at a slow but hectic pace it is still such a well done film that it needs four stars for there to be any justice It isn t for everyone and like any biography whether it be a movie or a book it can be technical and boring to the right or wrong people While it is hard to pinpoint exactly why this film is great it simply is It s probably not something you ll want to sit through again and again but it is a brilliant piece of work Even if you only see it once AMADEUS deserves to be seen
1002,Ambush The,1969,Synopsis In Serbia just after World War II an idealistic young man joins the Young Communists He works with the secret police in their campaign to exterminate all anti revolutionary elements A gritty realistic and compelling drama that exposes Communism as a completely corrupt and murderous system It s not surprising that this film was banned by the Yugoslavian government Yugoslavia English subtitles black and white 1969 banned by Yugoslavian government censors released 1990 80 minutes Director Zivojin Pavlovic The story centers on Ive an idealistic and naive young man who firmly believes in the Communist Party and its ideology His initial association with the Party is as a musician at various functions However his involvement grows particularly when his friends criticize him for his girlfriend whose father is a known bourgeois Ive neglects his schooling to work with the secret police in their campaign to exterminate the anti revolutionary elements the Chetniks who are the remnants of the previous ruling class He helps set up ambushes where the Chetniks can be killed or captured This film was made in 1969 and banned by the Yugoslavian government after its initial screening The film by portraying Communism in a very realistic light severely criticizes it In this film you clearly see the Communist ideals of social justice The Father of Ive s girlfriend is condemned as a bourgeouis in a kangaroo trial Their logic is that you are rich this proves you stole the property you now have therefore it is morally correct for us to throw you out of your house This they do then descend on his house like a gang of thieves and vandals ransacking it The secret police are shown engaging in deplorable behavior in their campaign of political justice They kill people who are found with UNNRA food packages UNNRA U N Refugee Relief Agency then trade the food for sex They stop people they suspect of anti revolutionary activity and execute them on the spot They requisition grain from mills by stealing it at gunpoint They try to ambush the Chetniks and kill them without giving them a chance to surrender Also when they return to the village they lie about their exploits portraying themselves as heroes Further the film also states clearly but by implication that Stalin and Tito are murderers and liars Given the mass murder of their regimes that is an accurate characterization The clear message of the film is that Communism is rotten to the core and Communists are either naive like Ive or evil liars thieves murderers Simply by presenting a realistic portrait of the revolution the film harshly condemns it Given the film s message it s not surprising that it was banned by the Yugoslavian government after its initial screenings in 1969 The film is in black and white and there are no stars in it However I strongly recommend seeing it if you have the opportunity It superbly tells a chilling and compelling story about a corrupt and murderous social and political system Print Source Centar Film Borisa Kidrica 71 Belgrade 11000 Yugoslavia

10023,Anastasia,1997,Cartoons were originally just the opening act to whet the audience s appetite for the cinematic main course Walt Disney changed all of that in 1937 with the first feature length animated movie SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS Since then what brings people into the theaters rather than the now ubiquitous video rental emporiums has changed dramatically The movies that make money these days rely heavily on star power or special effects frequently both Young kids are seen less and less at the multiplex because studios are ignoring them Is it that fewer kids are coming and therefore the studio s wise marketeers are cutting back on kids movies to match the decrease in demand Teenagers on the other hand remain the mother lode for theater owners Yet some animated movies have been successful and a few such as THE LION KING have been incredibly lucrative So what does it take to make a winning movie with cartoon characters Although there is no sure and certain recipe aside from having a Disney logo some of the ingredients include color images music humor and a compelling story The non Disney animated movie ANASTASIA by the directing and producing team of Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has already become a holiday hit Its popularity comes from a combination of all of the above ingredients but one part stands head and shoulders above the rest the images which are worthy of a master painter This film is so beautiful that if the sound system were to go out you would have absolutely no reason to demand your money back Just watching the picture provides the vast majority of the enjoyment which is not to say that the other parts have problems since they do not Although the songs are the film s weakest element even some of them especially Dancing Bear are quite lovely ANASTASIA is a retelling of the legend of the missing Romanov princess Historians would be well advised to skip the picture for it plays fast and loose with the facts but others will not care This is a cartoon to entertain audiences not an instructional video Meg Ryan is the voice of a sassy tough and attractive Anastasia Ryan becomes the character rather than the other way around unlike the Genie in ALADDIN for example who became Robin Williams If your girls are looking for a good role model look no further Anastasia is a resourceful and self assured young woman who is capable of saving her boyfriend rather being saved herself A con artist named Dimitri John Cusack takes a beautiful orphan named Anya Ryan and transforms her into a mock Anastasia falling in love with his creation in the process The twist is that Anya may actually be Anastasia Kelsey Grammer is the voice of Dimitri s companion in crime Vladimir If they can convince the Dowager Empress Marie Angela Lansbury that Anya is Anastasia they will get a ten million ruble reward Anastasia has a cute little dog named Pooka who unlike most cartoon characters does not get to talk Along the way Dimitri and Anastasia have to fight the dastardly villain Rasputin Christopher Lloyd who keeps falling to pieces literally His hands fly off his mouth falls down and he generally cannot keep himself together we ve all had days like that Rasputin s frequently not so willing companion is a wise talking bat named Bartok Hank Azaria The memorable parts of ANASTASIA are the visuals Although words cannot do them justice let me mention a few of the best There is one sequence in a train where they show the boiler of the engine Oranges and reds dance across the screen as the heat of the flames makes the air undulate in front of the viewers When the train crashes down into the canyon it explodes in a fireball both realistic and gorgeous The characters are all drawn with life like delicacy And there is a scene set inside a French house with photo accurate Impressionist and other paintings on the walls Finally there is a simple scene of Anya looking into the waters of a stream which reflect with a magical luminescence It is easy to go on but the film is more to be seen than discussed ANASTASIA runs 1 34 It is rated G and would be fine for the whole family There is some potential that the littlest munchkins might be scared by Rasputin but I saw no evidence of it in our packed theater My son Jeffrey age 8 said he thought the show was pretty good and that he liked the funny doggie Pooka the best His friend Kerry also 8 said she thought the movie was great Her favorite scene was when Anastasia hands Dimitri a stick of dynamite to uncouple two stuck railroad cars A surprised and wide eyed Dimitri remarks That will work
10024,Raiders of the Lost Ark,1981,You know what most adventure films ultimately lack A sense of wonder that s what But RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is an utterly delightful exception Not to say that this is a deeply philosophical film Hell no But it does possess something that adventure films often strive for but rarely achieve a real sense of the mystical Archaeologist Indiana Jones quest to beat the Nazis in the search for the fabled Ark Of The Covenant is certainly a pretty intriguing premise Still in less inspired hands such a story could easily have fallen prey to limp writing and empty spectacle Luckily for us the team of writer George Lucas and director Steven Speilberg have created such cracking good action sequences and invested the film with such a sense of awe and mystery that RAIDERS is able to stand alongside the most thrilling Hollywood movies ever made Of course the other vital components of a great action film are also in place solid storytelling colourful characters spicy romance and exotic mid Eastern locales topped off with some very convincing and horrifying special effects Oh and a terrific sense of humour One short sequence about mid way through when Jones is confronted by a showy sabre wielding bad guy is a bonafide all time classic sight gag If by chance you haven t yet seen it you re guaranteed a belly laugh Although RAIDERS is based on the old Saturday afternoon matinees of the 30 s 40 s it doesn t date the film one iota Indeed Karen Allen s strong gutsy female lead is very much an exception in action films Not for her the stupid passive damsel in distress of years gone by Nor of sequels to come I might add witness Kate Capshaw s unbearable hysterics in the follow up TEMPLE OF DOOM As Indiana Jones Harrison Ford is more the traditional action hero but what a hero he makes A nod must also go to composer John Williamson for his near perfect score particularly that haunting minor chord theme which appears right on cue at the most awe inspiring moments And the film is beautifully photographed by Douglas Slocombe so if you re seeing it on video the widescreen version is a must RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is absolutely terrific American filmmaking worth seeing again and again as an example of Hollywood at its most inspired A massive box office success and richly deserved
10025,Toy Story,1995,Toy Story is a landmark in cinema animation not only for its unique and high quality virtual reality look but also for the quality of the script and story Toy Story is about Andy s toys Andy is a typical kid perhaps ten years old and is blessed with an assortment of toys that walk and talk independently when no humans are looking Andy s favorite toy is a cowboy doll Woody voiced by Tom Hanks However Woody soon has serious competition from a Space Ranger toy Buzz voiced by Tim Allen Woody s jealousy of Buzz ultimately leads to both toys in the clutches of disturbed neighbor kid Sid who destroys toys Can Woody and Buzz find their way back to Andy Meanwhile Buzz must learn to accept that he is just a toy The animation of Toy Story is superb From a technology standpoint this is the most important animated film since Snow White The toys live in a virtual reality world where everything is very lifelike yet clearly animated Andy s toys have a very entertaining rapport Some of the toys are suspicious and cruel others endearingly earnest Their petty squabbles and jealousies are funny and very well written It is interesting to contrast Andy s toys with Sid s Sid enjoys operating on his toys interchanging parts until they look like worse than one of Dr Moreau s freaks It is not an original observation to note that Sid s toys are hideous but gentle silent yet organized while Andy s toys are conventional but bicker endlessly The quality of Snow White was never fully repeated The prospects are brighter for topping Toy Story since the animation techniques may become cheaper and better over time It will prove more difficult to improve upon the clever dialogue and the plot which is full of dramatic tension
10026,Airplane!,1980,Directed by Jim Abrahams David Zucker and Jerry Zucker Running Time 88 minutes Originally Released 1980 AIRPLANE is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making After all it s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing directing teams Even if most people don t recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles AIRPLANE TOP SECRET THE NAKED GUN and HOT SHOTS to name a few But although the Zucker Abrahams Zucker team was first introduced with THE KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE in 1977 AIRPLANE remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts In the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high Films like EARTHQUAKE THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE were big hits There was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade And so in 1980 we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film This time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish AIRPLANE is the story of Ted Striker Robert Hays an ex fighter pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades Unable to stop living in the past Ted s world fell apart He spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant Elaine Dickinson Julie Hagerty In a desperate attempt not to lose her Ted buys a ticket for the same flight Elaine is working Unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes Ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in self pity In the midst of it all something happens Someone gets sick Then another Then another Soon the whole plane is full of deathly ill Chicago bound people and when the pilots get sick played by Peter Graves Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Frank Ashmore who will save the day Gee I wonder Of course the main draw here is the non stop whiz bang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags Although I had seen this movie a few times before I was still laughing thru the entire thing The most fun character by far is the doctor played by Leslie Nielsen He s a dry subtle sterotypically straight faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film In a film like this you re not really expecting an elaborate production so one can t complain about the amateurish quality What you can complain about is the absolutely annoying Johnny played by Stephen Stucker This character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny I don t know why he was put in there and I don t think anybody will find a good excuse And when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old You gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long Aside from that AIRPLANE is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic It would be a good choice to pop in the VCR with a group of friends especially if they haven t seen it And if they ask what the plot is just tell em It s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but that s not important right now If you ve seen the film you ll understand
10027,Rainmaker The,1997,Written by Francis Ford Coppola adapted from the novel by John Grisham Starring Matt Damon Claire Danes Danny DeVito Jon Voight and Danny Glover Ingredients neophyte lawyer legal situations corrupt insurance company Synopsis Rudy Baylor Matt Damon is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time Rudy s girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband Rudy s elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded and the family of Rudy s friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn t pay for a bone marrow transplant Rudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser Danny Devito who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge Danny Glover Jon Voight plays Leo F Drummond the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all powerful insurance company s team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice Will Rudy defeat Leo Will he enjoy being a lawyer Opinion The good news is that this movie has a happy ending and it features a guy trying to do the right thing Director Francis Ford Coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie In the typical lawyer movie there s one big case and the movie focuses on solving it and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins after lots of gripping courtroom drama However Coppola s movie is deliberately more low key The Rainmaker plays out like a personality sketch of young Rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters In the background Rudy s voice narrates his feelings and makes half cynical jokes about the legal profession in general Two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be First Rudy s time is split juggling three cases rather than concentrating on a single high stakes case Also Rudy s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge The end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win and Rudy narrates his way into coming of age
10028,Alien: Resurrection,1997,Alien Resurrection takes its roots from the second film in this 18 year old film series Resurrection is more of an action film than anything and as an action film Resurrection works very well For those of you who don t want to know how Ripley comes back from the dead those that don t remember Ripley dove to her death in Alien 3 skip this next paragraph and go to the next one When I saw the trailers for Alien Resurrection I wondered how they would bring Ripley back from the dead But the well written script by Joss Whedon finds a way to bring her back that is though not unique so simple that it bypassed me They cloned Ripley with some blood samples To tell you how the aliens come back in this movie will spoil the movie but lets just say that the aliens do come back and the are better than ever French director Jean Pierre Jeunet seems to have turned up the goo level on the aliens though the spit and the drool are just generally gooey Next to this though Jeunet finds some interesting ways to show how intelligent these creatures really are An example to look for is how the aliens escape Sigourney Weaver brings back Ripley but this time Ripley is different Ripley has come back with an attitude and is going to take it out on the aliens Sure Ripley had an attitude in the last three films but this time it s a huge attitude I liked Ripley but I think Winona Rider s Call is cooler Though Ryder looks so fragile her Call shows that she can take a few hits As for the other cast members when I first read who was going to be in the movie I rolled my eyes and said to myself They re kidding right But I was completely wrong The actor that I originally disagreed with most was Dan Hedaya For me Hedaya has always been a comedic actor I wondered how they would fit him into Resurrection I m happy to say I was all wrong Hedaya does well in Resurrection The other player that bothered me was Michael Wincott but he also does a great job in Resurrection Worth mentioning are actor Ron Perlman and the great score by John C Frizzell Perlman was a joy to watch and his character was pretty funny providing a lot of the comic relief in the film with sharp one liners Frizzell s score though not as good as Horner s score for Aliens is admirable And one scene that knocked me out of my seat was the underwater scene Please look at this scene I loved it I loved how they handled the alien in the water This is a great scene The only part that bothered me was the last 15 minutes or so of the film The film builds up well but the ending is somewhat of a let down Don t let this make you skip the movie This is a fun and exciting action film set in the Alien universe See it for Weaver Perlman and especially Ryder Don t miss Alien Resurrection On a side note I noticed that H R Giger again got no onscreen credit for his Alien design And although he did not work on this film the design is his and I think that he should have gotten credit for such a wonderful design Please don t forget who created and designed the Alien one of the best sci fi aliens around Cheers to H R Giger for such a wonderful design
10029,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,1997,My mom taught me that if I haven t got anything good to say about something then I should keep quiet It ll be hard to find something good to say about Mortal Kombat Annihilation so I ll have to break that rule for just one review I enjoyed the original Mortal Kombat movie it was a fun movie When it made a bucket load of money I figure the studio heads also began loving the movie and what do studio heads do when they see a movie that grosses so high Produce a sequel of course What got me worried about Mortal Kombat Annihilation was that there was no press showing before the movie was released meaning that the all the local papers were not able to review the movie This usually means only one thing the studio heads want this movie to make lots of money based on namesake but they themselves have found that the movie was so bad that they though it would harbor lots of bad reviews which might spoil opening weekend grosses My fears were unfortunately proven correct Mortal Kombat Annihilation is a horrible movie in which the plot plays out like a teen ager with a pocket full of quarters The story is paper thin the gateways to some evil world is opened up again and bad guys come to Earth to try to steal the planet for reasons unknown a group of fighters must fight the bad guys to win back Earth The movie moves from one fight scene to another taking no breaks At the length that the movie runs after the first few fights I was numb to the uniqueness of the heavily choreographed fighting The fighting scenes are hampered by some pretty bad special effects Blue screen effects standout like a sore thumb For the price of admission a Mortal Kombat fan could play a few games of Mortal Kombat and have more fun than this painful piece of film This film should be skipped both on the big screen and on video This is a horrible attempt at trying to milk a pretty good original movie Stay far away from this one
1003,Sinnui yauman II,1990,Synopsis The continuing adventures of a young debt collector in ancient China who has a real talent for getting into trouble This time he encounters guerillas a monk who travels underground like a mole and he fights monsters and demons using magic Wild and very entertaining though it s not as good as part I Hong Kong English subtitles color 1990 104 minutes Director Ching Siu tung Producer Tsui Hark Before discussing part II it is appropriate to mention part I A CHINESE GHOST STORY part I is the story of a young debt collector in ancient China who stays overnight at a haunted temple There he meets and falls in love with a beautiful vampire ghost He battles monsters demons and ghosts to give her a chance at reincarnation Part I is a fast paced horror and adventure film with a strong dose of humor It was relatively popular and introduced many people to the exciting films that are being made in Hong Kong Part II begins where part I left off for people who haven t seen it part I is recapped in brief highlights at the beginning of part II The debt collector is arrested by the police on grounds that he may be an escaped convict He is put into a prison cell with an old man a scholar whose dietary preferences include cockroaches Just before he is to be executed he escapes After escaping he meets a monk who travels underground by burrowing like a mole They encounter a band of guerillas one of whom Windy looks exactly like the beautiful vampire ghost he was in love with in part I Together they fight political corruption monsters and demons using magic and martial arts Part II is very much like part I it is a fast paced horror and adventure film There are a few differences though In part I the emphasis was on ghosts most of whom were in human form whereas in part II the ghosts and demons that appear are primarily in the form of monsters There is a large corpse monster similar to the smaller ones in part I and the fight against it is outrageously funny Also appearing is a monster in the form of a large golden Buddha and a gigantic flying centipede The special effects are generally very good though the giant centipede is clearly a model The same actors and actresses appear in both parts so there is continuity in the roles The major differences in the two films is that part I has more humor which I really appreciate and part I has a tighter better story line Although part II is recapped at the beginning of part II I suggest that you see part I before part II First the recap is far too brief Second part I is incredibly good and it is certainly worth seeing Thus I suggest seeing both parts I and II if you have the opportunity very entertaining and enjoyable Print Source Gordon s Films International Inc 8 Chatham Square Room 805 New York NY 10038 Currently in its initial theatrical release in the U S
10030,Ma vie en rose,1997,By Harvey Karten Ph D Sony Pictures classics Director Alain Berliner Writer Chris Vander Stappen Alain Berliner Cast Georges DuFresne Jean Philippe Ecoffey Daniel Hanssens Michele Laroque Cristina Barget Julien Riviere The suburbs are stereotyped as places which do not tolerate differences the way urban residents do and writers Chris Vander Stappen and Alain Berliner do nothing to subvert that notion In Ma Vie En Rose My Life in Pink which played at the New York Film Festival and at Cannes and was winner in the Best Picture category at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival first time director Berliner scores big using a remarkable first time actor in the title role Told from the point of view of a seven year old boy Ludovic George DuFresne Ma Vie En Rose focuses in on a middle class Brussels suburb in which everyone seems to act cheerfully alike and old age appears to have been banished Elisabeth Helene Vincent a grandma and the oldest person in the movie looks as though she had gone through liposuction and a few tucks The liveliest one in the crowd this fifty something woman switches off a slow dance number at a party and substitutes music with a disco beat obviously a woman who has come to maturity during the peak of the feminist revolution The teachers are all young attractive and lithe and even the psychologist who is hired to treat Ludovic looks as though she has just received her doctorate This emphasis on youth and on startlingly bright colors as well signals us that Ma Vie En Rose is in many ways a fairy tale one which never tries overtly to make statements or suggest psychological theories in fact director Berliner could not care less about where his characters are headed This is all to the good Ludo acts differently from all others in the community though it becomes clear that he is not doing so to draw attention to himself At the age of seven he is at the point n life that psychologists say people carve out an identity Ludo knows his he is a girl in a boy s body who has little regard for hiding his transvestism even though his behavior will lead to his father s losing his job his own expulsion from his school his parents going ballistic and the neighbors staring at his antics in downright shock and deadly silence If this kid lived in New York or Paris nobody would pay heed but in a suburb which values fitting in above all other traits he is an outcast For the most part Berliner treats the situation with good humor though he does have his director of photography Yves Cape mute the vivid colors for most of the second half of the movie turning the bright reds and blues into pale shadows of their former selves Ludovic s antics lead to one disaster after another In a school play he locks Snow White in the bathroom and takes over the role himself if only to be kissed by Jerome Julien Riviere the lad he has fallen in love with He attends a party in a skirt his parents telling their neighbors that they are allowing the boy to fulfill his fantasies and thereby banalize them which is to say will allow him to outgrow his illusions Though the neighbors smile in apparent understanding they unanimously sign a petition causing him to be thrown out of school The most amusing scene occurs just after Ludovic is told by his older sister Zoe Cristina Barget that God creates boys by giving them XY chromosomes while XX genes are distributed to the females Ludo dreams that he was set to get his double x but one letter bounced off the chimney and landed in the trash can ergo the girl in a boy s body Ludo may or may not outgrow his cross dressing proclivity But Ma Vie En Rose has no intention to make us care What this charming little story does care about is relating incidents as a child sees them a boy at the age in which everything is possible including his turning into a girl when he grows up who wants everyone to love him without demanding that he conform to their narrow expectations The ensemble which at times seem like characters from a Disney sketch play their parts impeccably Jean Philippe Ecoffey as Pierre the father who learns to accept his son s tendencies Michele Laroque as Hanna the mom who tries to understand but rages within Daniel Hanssens as Albert Pierre s boss a creep who assures Pierre that his job is safe but betrays him and especially Georges DuFresne in his first acting job a solemn kid who rarely smiles but always insists on being himself Rated R Running Time 88 minutes C 1997 Harvey Karten
10032,Bean,1997,1 2 out of 4 A faithful follower of the British TV series I was eager to see BEAN Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean is the only comic these days who does great nonverbal comedy Seeing him in a feature length film was going to be a treat His TV show is presented in half hour pieces split into 2 or 3 seven minute sketches Each sketch then is about as long as a Looney Tunes cartoon and just as silly In BEAN there are still identifiable sketches and each is about the same length as in the show maybe shorter Some of them are great Many of them are recycled from his TV show One thing s certain there aren t enough of them These sketches fit within Mr Bean s latest adventure a night guard at a museum Bean is selected to be the museum s liaison in a deal to sell Whistler s Mother to an American gallery He is chosen not for his knowledge of Whistler but because the job will get him out of the British museum s hair for three months On the show the sketches are always tightly packed with Atkinson s gags However in the movie a lot of time is spent between sketches on the required structure of a movie plot characters conflict etc Those gaps are what makes BEAN an average movie instead of a hilarious star vehicle The problem with the gaps is not just the absence of Atkinson it is the presence of a token plot and shallow characters that requires the attention to shift from silly abandon to forced concern Any comic momentum Atkinson builds is halted when the movie cuts to his American host s Peter MacNicol wife Pamela Reed threatening divorce I have seen interviews with Smith who says the movie structure was a necessary evil I think he s wrong Too many directors take the traditional structure of a movie as a necessity I sometimes complain that a movie has too much plot not enough action This time it s too much plot not enough Rowan A good example of a movie that shunned plot in favor of comedy is LIAR LIAR In that movie a wisp of a plot and a clever idea gives Jim Carrey a good 60 minutes of comic material The story in BEAN seems solid enough to have given Smith and Atkinson the same opportunity but they were too careful too concerned with the plot Smith even said he had to cut some of Rowan s sketches that didn t fit well with the story What Smith didn t realize is that if BEAN will be remembered it won t be for the story it will be for Atkinson s performance Cutting Atkinson in favor of the story was a bad case of misordered priorities
10033,Gattaca,1997,out of 4 In a world where children are genetically screened and filtered before birth Vincent is born with no artificial genetic help from his parents Which is too bad for him because he is born into a society where a job interview consists solely of evaluating your DNA Vincent s parents decide to have another child a boy for Vincent This time they get the help of a geneticist So Vincent grows up weaker shorter and less graceful than his younger brother Anton If that weren t enough mom and dad treat the boys differently as if Vincent might break from the same fall that Anton brushes off Understandably Vincent grows up wanting to get as far away from home and from people as possible all the way to the moons of Jupiter Vincent Ethan Hawke makes an arrangement with Jerome Jude Law a genetically superior person who had the bad luck to become paralyzed from the waist down in an accident Vincent uses Jerome s blood urine skin and name to get the job that will send him away from Earth Jerome gets room and board and a part of Vincent s income When Vincent s mission director is murdered cops and FBI hoovers referring to the cell gathering vacuums and to J Edgar Hoover begin a close genetic scrutiny of all employees at Gattaca A wayward eyelash of Vincent s not Jerome s is found and the cops believe they are close to finding the murderer It sounds a lot like a sci fi thriller but really Gattaca is more a human drama The backdrop happens to be an Orwellian future but the story itself is a simple tale of a man with a dream fighting against stereotypes On the one hand It was wonderful It was a somber dark quiet human movie The story was a noble struggle against an unfair oppressor but it was handled with quiet determination not violent intensity The metaphoric details were relevant both to the story and to the underlying myth For example our hero s last name is Freeman his dream is to fly to the stars and those who hold him back judge his ignoble birth not his spirit The pacing was calm and unhurried The lighting and production design was not literal but mood setting cars had fluorescent bulb colored headlights Vincent s home was richly tinted blue work was cold stark and clean Overall it felt like a return to the womb It really drew me in and made me want to stay Gattaca started with a simple beautiful idea took a calm and dignified approach and was capably and coherently given life It could have been a superb movie On the other hand several details were not BAD but missed their mark When I attended film school we called making use of narration an NYU Save the joke being that if you failed to make a coherent movie adding a narration would save it It also allowed us to make fun of another film school There is a lot of narration in GATTACA It didn t DETRACT but it made me wonder why the filmmakers thought so much of it was necessary Perhaps if I weren t privy to the film school joke I wouldn t have even noticed the narration But it is a valid criticism in a medium that is supposed to show rather than tell Also the movie s setting says that genetic makeup might one day predetermine our lives This is the adversity the hero must face But it is a straw man adversity The movie makes the point that a man is more than just his genes but there s little satisfaction in proving the point because nobody is seriously arguing otherwise Finally and most importantly many of the movie s specifics were very obvious or very simple For example If you were in valid not genetically enhanced the only job you could get was night janitor Literally The real killer is identified because she spat in her victim s eye Literally These pieces ALMOST felt as if they were included to make the story mythic timeless or metaphoric But the rest of the movie was too specific to make a good myth and so these literalized metaphors felt almost like a joke The story itself overcoming discrimination to achieve your goals suffers the same problems It sounds timeless and mythic taken out of context But in a specific movie with a specific cast in a physical set open ended metaphor slips down into uninspired reality That s why I think Gattaca would make a better book than a movie All the elements that in the film seemed uninspired would with a reader s imagination be accepted more poetically I m rooting for GATTACA to do well because I think it was an inspired attempt at timeless filmmaking by a novice director no less but for me it didn t quite make it
10034,Rainmaker The,1997,out of 4 You never know what to expect from Coppola sometimes you get a great film and sometimes you get JACK THE RAINMAKER is an above average courtroom drama It is a good solid well made movie It s no classic but it s worth seeing This is the sixth big screen adaptation of a John Grisham novel In this outing the young Memphis lawyer is Rudy Baylor played by Matt Damon Rudy is just out of law school and looking for work He finds it in the shady law office of Bruiser Stone that s Mickey Rourke believe it or not who s under investigation by the FBI Bruiser agrees to hire Rudy on the condition that he recruit his own clients Rudy just happens to have two cases that he landed from a school open house event One of the cases turns out to be big a leukemia patient Donnie Ray Black Johnnie Whitworth and his mother file a lawsuit against a crooked insurance company for denying their legitimate claim One night Rudy and his legal assistant Deck Shiffler Danny DeVito discuss their future with Bruiser s law firm They decide that the FBI is getting too serious and that the heat will be too great at Bruiser s offices so they take their cases and leave the firm just in the nick of time Now on their own they bring Great Benefit Insurance and its five lawyers to court In the outstanding performance of the movie Jon Voight is Leo Drummond the high paid slick confident power lawyer of the defense team Coppola gave Drummond enough smarts and clout to match Voight s performance The role could have easily been under written and over played but the actor and the role were tailored to suit each other Most of the movie follows the specifics of the court case from beginning to end and that in itself is an interesting twist Seems like most so called courtroom dramas dedicate lots of screen time to the crime and the out of court implications then they end with a big climax in the courtroom THE RAINMAKER actually follows the courtroom story for most of the movie But there are subplots In an inept attempt at ambulance chasing Rudy meets and falls for Kelly Riker the sweet likeable Claire Danes who is the victim of spousal abuse Another subplot involves Rudy s other case an old woman his landlord Teresa Wright who wants to rewrite her will to exclude family and include a Texas televangelist These subplots really were subservient to the main story line Though they were interwoven they existed separately They never really touched on the main plot They added a nice texture to the movie but I often felt the cross cutting was labored and unmotivated Also I question the intent of making Kelly the victim of abuse The way the movie dealt with her husband was to violently hate him much the same way the movie made you feel about the insurance company All of Rudy s dialogue regarding Kelly s husband is talk of murderous revenge I suppose in that way this movie is similar toSTARSHIP TROOPERS which takes pleasure in the extermination of its villains But where the hatred in STARSHIP TROOPERS was ironic and distanced in THE RAINMAKER it is righteous I think that s probably worse for society Is this a trend in movies of the late nineties to make the audience feel good about killing Are they sating our demand for public executions Still these scenes didn t detract from the experience they played a small enough part and they fit in with the movie s overall feel If there was anything that was wrong with THE RAINMAKER it was that the movie s conflict was too easy The insurance company was too cruel and the victims too sympathetic for there to be any question of the outcome The movie left no room for any real debate on health care insurance or tort reform For example a memo from the insurance company was written by an employee having a bad day The letter calls the claimant stupid stupid stupid If that weren t enough the letter is read aloud about four times in the movie and at one point it fills the movie screen That s not to say that the movie wasn t satisfying what could be more satisfying than the defeat of a melodramatic villain But it means you won t want to see the movie more than once and you probably won t remember it in five years But for here and now it s not a bad way to spend a couple of hours It s a solid well made courtroom drama that actually spends a lot of time in court
10035,Ice Storm The,1997,Christina Ricci saying I ll show you mine if you show me yours _that s_ what more arthouse movies need THE ICE STORM adapted from the novel by Rick Moody is a powerful Ang Lee film that explores the world of empty bitterness and loneliness of two Connecticut families during the sexual revolution of the 70s As we all know the American colonial war wasn t the only revolution with a shot heard round the world I don t know what that last sentence was supposed to mean exactly just chalk it up to one more vague sexual innuendo from the mouth of Andrew Kevin Kline Mr Name Above the Title plays an average husband He s got a wife Joan Allen two kids and a lot of tacky big collared shirts It s the kind of family that ships the teenage son off to boarding school leaves the teenage daughter at home and heads off to some lame party every night parties where they speculate about those wild California key parties That s when the men put their car keys in a bowl and the women fish out a random set of keys at the end of the night to see which guy they re going home with It beats the hell out of mistletoe I ll tell you that Kline also happens to be having an affair with the neighbor Sigourney Zuul Weaver But look out tables are turning Allen eventually gets it on with the husband in his car Do these seats go back and Weaver s son Elijah Wood is messing around with Kline s daughter Ricci the kind of plot twist you d find in an X rated episode of The Brady Bunch At the same time Ricci is drawn to Wood s younger brother a weird kid who spends his time blowing up his model airplanes and hanging his Army dolls Meanwhile there s Kline s son the only person who manages to pursue anyone outside the neighbor s family Home from boarding school for Thanksgiving weekend he arranges a train trip into New York to see a girl from his school For once he s trying to get to a woman before his best friend does until he shows up at the house and finds the friend already there This storyline was my personal favorite of the movie as someone who s had that special brother relationship with a lot of girls I ve had crushes on THE ICE STORM takes its precious time to get started but once it does it turns into one hell of a ride Its circular orchestrated plot and existential dialogue keep it from being anything raunchy or low brow In a movie where people of all ages search for meaning in sex drugs and alcohol nothing is glorified or exaggerated That is the beauty of THE ICE STORM and having seen it I can now say with all honesty I ll show you mine if you show me yours Serving America for more than 1 25th of a century
10036,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,1997,Clint Eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is an Eastwood directed film Clint isn t even in and it s damn good Adapted from a best selling John Berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre Georgia town of Savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head And that s just the mayor As director and producer Eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent 150 minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor Like all great movies MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion The acting from big time stars John Cusack and Kevin Spacey is as good as you d expect but it s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm Cusack plays a free lance reporter sent to Savannah to write a fluff story for Town Country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire Spacey s parties Lots of food beverages and gunplay Yes an employee of Spacey s has a huge argument in front of Cusack and later turns up dead It seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened Spacey shot at him missed then Spacey took him out but being a movie there s much more to it than that and Cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in The weird circle of entertainment This is where the stable of supporting characters comes in There s the requisite sexy woman Alison Nepotist s Daughter Eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite Miss Chablis deserves a paragraph of his her own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the Castilian scene and her testimony Chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen RuPaul but never seems exploited as the movie s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie There are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here Clint manages to keep the movie fascinating Certainly the characterizations of the judge and Spacey s lawyer both help immensely as does having the fly guy as the jury s foreman It s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of Spacey s homosexuality Yes Spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL isn t a classic but it is one of the better celebrity directed true story best seller adaptations out there Likewise no one from this movie will be getting any Oscar nominations but the performances are all great In fact I d almost recommend that the Academy add a Best Supporting Transvestite category Serving America for more than 1 25th of a century
10037,Rainmaker The,1997,THE RAINMAKER carries on the tradition of transforming John Grisham novels into big screen blockbusters This one though leans less toward the early Grisham action thrillers like THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF and more toward the courtroom drama of A TIME TO KILL and THE CHAMBER It s about a young white bread lawyer who overcomes the odds and scores a victory for the less fortunate and it s preachy as hell However with director Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of a large likeable cast THE RAINMAKER refuses to sink under the weight and predictability of the storyline Matt Damon is the hero this time around just out of law school and cramming for the bar exam He takes a job with a shyster Mickey Rourke who sets his lawyers up on a commission basis and sends them out to chase ambulances Damon learns the ropes from an older wiser unlicensed associate Danny DeVito and gets his first clients an old lady changing her will Teresa Wright and a not as old lady Mary Kay Place whose son is dying of leukemia Just as Rourke gets nailed by the FBI and Damon passes the bar he and DeVito partner up to form their own unholy alliance Claire Danes comes along at about the same time as a young woman whose husband put her in the hospital Hers is the predictable subplot that will haunt the movie until the end as Damon falls in love with her she leaves him and they decide to go back and get her stuff I assume this sidebar was trimmed greatly from the novel but in the Cliffs Notes version THE RAINMAKER movie affords us we see enough to know this is the same old Wife Beater Gets His plotline with no new twists It s the Corporate America Gets Theirs plotline that most of THE RAINMAKER is concerned with The leukemia kid bites the dust and the family sues the insurance company for wrongful death The company denied their claim eight times so he missed his treatment There are plenty of courtroom scenes much less sophisticated than we re used to where young Damon has to orient himself to court procedures and fight off the high paid insurance company attorney team led by a sneering Jon Voight It s never in doubt what the eventual outcome will be and which surprise witness will bring it As I ve maintained these last four paragraphs the plot is weak and the constant sermonizing against both the legal profession and the e e e evil insurance companies only makes the movie less appealing but thankfully the actors trapped in this story bring their own charm There s a lot more humor than you might expect particularly from DeVito and the two judges in the case Dean Stockwell and Danny Glover so the movie is worth watching but on the whole it s a low rent A TIME TO KILL Serving America for more than 1 25th of a century
10038,Little Mermaid The,1989,Eight years after its release Disney has decided to re release THE LITTLE MERMAID theatrically for 17 days and 17 long nights only Coincidentally it was reintroduced to theaters the same day Fox s animated film ANASTASIA was released You know Disney they can t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie so when someone else wants to make a little money they counter with an old masterpiece from their vault and you know what I went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from Fox Let no one say Disney is losing its monopoly on the market They still have hotels on Boardwalk _and_ Park Place Believe it or not today November 25 1997 at 5 05 p m I saw THE LITTLE MERMAID for the first time It took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago when I stayed with one of my mom s friends for a couple weeks They had a young child who listened to the LITTLE MERMAID soundtrack constantly and over that two week period I heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times By the time I got back home I promised myself I d never see the movie But promises are made to be broken especially when you re looking at a 17 day limited engagement Damn those shrewd Disney marketers and their mind games THE LITTLE MERMAID is based on a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale but it s Disney ized which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song It also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times I never wanted so much to be a pair of shells The heroine of course is Ariel voice of Jodi Benson a 16 year old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase She skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like Buddy Hackett who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans She s also dealing with feelings she hasn t had before which comes when you get scales in places you didn t use to have them about a handsome prince no Disney movie would be complete without one Her father King Triton of the merpeople strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the savage humans in a condemnation that reads as a not so subtle analogy about old fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating What s a king to do though The girl s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn t deter her Ariel saves the prince s life when a hurricane rises up and just has to meet him She makes a deal with Ursula the sea witch voice of Pat Carroll You know she s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history She also has octopus tentacles for feet something those Dr Scholl s corn pads will not fix and offers to help Ariel out She ll make her a human for three days if Ariel will give up her pretty voice Ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her or else she becomes a slave to the witch FOREVER And if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple she ll fall asleep FOREVER It s a simplistic plot yes but THE LITTLE MERMAID was a revolution in the Disney world coming after such lackluster efforts as THE BLACK CAULDRON and OLIVER AND COMPANY It ranks as one of the best Disney cartoons certainly since the 50s All the elements are there memorable songs like Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl cartoon animals like Sebastian and Flounder an evil villain who still has characterization and charm and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children THE LITTLE MERMAID is worth a big screen ticket in 1997 so hurry up you only have five days left Serving America for more than 1 25th of a century
10039,Peacemaker The,1997,Cast George Clooney Nicole Kidman Marcel Iures Gary Werntz Holt McCallany Alexander Baluev Rene Medvesek Michael Boatman Armin Mueller Stahl Director Mimi Leder Screenplay Michael Schiffer After watching too many movies where the bad guys are the Russians the Chinese the entire Eastern block and now the Bosnians AND the good guys are none other than the Americans once again I badly need to see a movie where the American s lose big time And I think the most likely place to find the product of such a fantasy would most likely be in Iraq i e Hussein productions Not that I have anything against the Americans winning all the time but I m in great need of a different perspective on life Once again in this movie The Peacemaker the safety of the United States is once again under threat by some very angry Bosnians who blame the US and the UN for their problems This brings to mind that too often repeated statement by Nicole Kidman I m not afraid of the man who has ten nuclear warheads I m afraid of the one who only wants one My trite reply to this is Give me ten nuclear warheads and I ll show you who to be afraid of I m a peaceable easy going kind of a guy but in this movie I had this incredible urge to want to see the terrorist succeed Of course I wouldn t want anyone injured but I felt the dire urge for the bomb to go off and with it that grand delusion that the United States is the greatest nation on this earth Of course I ve seen New York Washington and Dallas enveloped in flames i e Independence Day but that doesn t really count When the world is under threat from big bad aliens of course I m going to side with the Americans So this new movie from SKG productions aims at the heart of the great nation drawing on the wild card of patriotism and a threat to the people It s a safe tactic to play when the plot and script isn t solid engrossing material The SKG team has decided on the leading man for the moment George Clooney to help boost this movie s popularity and banked on an actress who is both attractive and a constant solid performer Nicole Kidman However this does not save The Peacemaker from its otherwise very ordinary make The ending gets as improbable as Nicole Kidman dismantling a nuclear device with a pen knife in 2 5 minutes which is more ludicrous than an American President kicking butt on a hijacked plane if you ask me
1004,Da Taijian Li Lianying,1991,Synopsis The story of Tzu hsi the Dowager Empress of China and her relationship with Li Lianying her lead eunuch A historical drama filled with palace intrigue and conflict Very well made the film should appeal to fans of historical Chinese films China Hong Kong English and German subtitles color 1991 110 minutes Director Writer Tian Zhuangzhuang The story is told through flashbacks as the elderly Li Lianying recounts his adventures as the lead eunuch to the Dowager Empress The stories span a period of 40 years and include various palace intrigues such as Li Lianying being accused of bribery and impersonating a Prince Li Lianying trying to get his niece married to the Emperor and the romance between the Emperor and his favorite consort Pearl Blossom Also dramatized is the Empress fleeing the Forbidden City just before it is captured by foreign devils the British and her later return to power Li Lianying and the Dowager Empress are frequently portrayed in extremely unsympathetic terms In particular Li Lianying is generally considered to have been very evil This film presents them in a slightly more sympathetic light Li Lianying is a complex character somewhat scheming and cunning but not openly evil The evil things that he does are on the direct orders of the Dowager Empress The Dowager is portrayed as a cunning domineering and manipulative woman but who can be nice at least to Li Lianying Much of the emphasis in the film is on the relationship between Li Lianying and the Empress The film is well made lavish sets were made and portions of the film were actually made in the Forbidden City The photography is excellent and the story is well written However the film is rather slow moving and this may bother some viewers Some knowledge of Chinese history during the reign of the Dowager Empress will increase your appreciation for the film but it is not absolutely necessary Because the film is somewhat slow moving and on a topic of limited interest I would not recommend it to a general audience However if you are interested in Chinese history or enjoy Chinese historical films then you will probably find it worthwhile Print Source Skai Film Production Ltd Flat B 10 F Kee Shing Commercial Bldg 80 Kimberly Road Kowloon Hong Kong
10040,Alien: Resurrection,1997,ALIEN RESURRECTION is a mess The fourth film in the series is easily the worst film in the series No it s not a total bomb Ms Weaver is immanently watchable the art direction is a winner there s more humor to go around and director Jean Pierre Jeunet THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN DELICATESSEN has a great eye for the grotesque If nothing else there s certainly more goo glop and gore than in the first three films combined The opening scene details in queasy close up the surgical removal of you know what from Ms Weaver s cloned character s chest But is it exciting suspenseful or even scary No not really More than anything else there s just too much going on The various chases and fire fights are so poorly integrated that even the best bits often cancel each other out To make matters worse the score by John Frizzell telegraphs each and every boo before it happens The finale is the worst with a hybrid creature as likely to inspire giggles as gags Okay the presence of Winona Ryder is pretty damn funny too And can someone please explain the final scene Why is everyone so happy after witnessing such huge and presum ably devastating destruction Game over man

10043,Alien: Resurrection,1997,Chad z rating out of 4 fair below average 1997 R 108 minutes 1 hour 48 minutes starring Sigourney Weaver Ripley Winona Ryder Call Ron Perlman Johner Gary Dourdan Christie written by Joss Whedon produced by Bill Badalato Gordon Carroll David Giler Walter Hill directed by Jean Pierre Jeunet based on characters created by Dan O Bannon Ronald Shusett Seen December 1 1997 at 7 20 p m at The Glenwood Movieplex Cinemas Oneida NY theater 2 by myself for free free pass Theater rating good seats sound and picture If there s anything I learned about the Alien series it s the fact it epitomizes the term The more things change the more they stay the same Each film has a unique direction to it yet the stories and individual elements are basically the same But what s most annoying about Alien Resurrection besides the fact it repeats absolutely everything we ve seen before is it doesn t even try to have any direction or originality Describing the plots and the way they are set up in these films is beginning to become an exercise in futility and I wouldn t doubt the screenwriters feel the same way writing them Much like the previous sequels there s a lot of jargon and rhetoric here to explain how Ripley Weaver will end up facing the aliens even though everything was fine when we last saw her This time it s 200 years after the death of her original self and scientists have created a clone of her why did they wait so long How they did this isn t clearly explained but we are knocked over the head with the fact she has memories and was slightly crossbred with alien DNA which explains her super strength and psychic abilities We get more variations on the same plot such as the arrogant scientists and leaders who try to study breed and exploit the aliens but something goes wrong and chaos ensues There s also a militia brat pack although this time they re pirates instead of miners marines or prisoners Much like Ripley they re also re incarnated characters First there s Johner Perlman the wise cracking tough guy then Call Ryder the smart rational strong willed woman Christie Dourdan the special weapons guy along with a cripple in a high tech wheelchair a frail woman and the suave leader Most of these characters will die just as we re beginning to like them and one of them will turn out to be a robot deja vu The storytelling here is so choppy we don t really get establishment of plot but a collection of remotely related scenes such as the scientist driven mad with curiosity studying the aliens or the meeting between the pirate leader and the corrupt military leader which somehow explains why the pirates are on board the huge military vessel the film takes place in Of course the aliens break free from their cages and run rampant around the ship killing many of the humans and giving the pirates something to run from and shoot at And if that wasn t generic enough I counted at least six times in which the music built up with violins screeching and then an alien popping out the shadows and killing someone There s also an interesting scene the only one for that matter that takes place underwater but somehow the humans manage to hold their breath for five or ten minutes Most of the film recycles and even rips off elements from the other films that didn t work that well to begin with We get dizzying action sequences with fire and bullets flying all over the place corny one liners guns jam up at the last second and people apparently dead come back to life The faux Gothic atmosphere with lots of shadows strobe lights and steam all over the place is also tiring The aliens themselves are now such cartoony embodiments of evil it s hard not to laugh at them much less be frightened by them The Alien films are meant to be intense sci fi thrillers and there s no doubt that s what Alein Resurrection is too and I don t object to that principle What I do object to is how the film constantly tries harder to be intense but the more it does so the sillier it seems
10044,Rainmaker The,1997,Frankly the last thing that I wanted to see on a Saturday night was yet another John Grisham flick about yet another young law dude Matt Damon tackling his first big case This is what the third such story in a row after THE CHAMBER and A TIME TO KILL Imagine my surprise to find adaptation 6 possessing a strong often broadly played comedic streak Sure the outcome is predictable duh but the road to get there is refreshingly lighter hearted Francis Ford Coppola who wrote and directed serves up ample humor at every turn from those de liriously tacky Memphis locales to the occasional bit of outright slap stick The scene stealer here is DeVito In a smaller role Mickey Rourke is oily fun And don t miss Dean Stockwell s delightful hacking cough cameo The courtroom scenes have the requisite surprises but not nearly enough dramatic punch The tone is breezy almost whimsical the pacing is methodical though we could use a bit more urgency toward the end Trickier is the subplot involving Claire Danes as an abused young wife and potential love interest but the filmmakers pull it off That is except for Elmer Bernstein s score that too often in trudes upon the couple s quiet time And as the main character real izes by the end of the movie there s no small irony in a story about an ambulance chasing money grubbing law firm going after a claims denying money grubbing insurance agency

10047,Alien: Resurrection,1997,Alien Resurrection R out of 1992 s Alien3 marked not only the death by suicide of its popular protagonist Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver but in many ways the Alien franchise itself box office receipts were anemic thanks to poor audience word of mouth and the critics who rallied around the first two installments 1979 s Alien and 1986 s Aliens savaged David Fincher s slog of a sendoff myself included Hence Weaver director Jean Pierre Jeunet and the others behind Alien Resurrection faced a two fold challenge not only somehow resurrect Ripley but also rescue this once profitable series from the scrap heap Despite the odds they have succeeded even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two Writer Joss Whedon devises a quick easy and painless answer to the dead Ripley problem clone her which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on Fiorina 161 the prison planet of the third film That done the _real_ challenge presents itself what do with her Alien introduced Ripley as smart and resourceful Aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable exploring her maternal side Alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death What could be next Whedon comes up with a clever spin since the original Ripley died while impregnated with an Alien queen the blood used for the clone is also infected with Alien DNA So the new Ripley is indeed new a human Alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength a psychic bond with the deadly species and a more predatory attitude Unfortunately that is where Alien Resurrection s clever streak in writing stops The Alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features But the story in Resurrection is more of an afterthought The movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train Aliens to do their bidding but once the creatures break free it is once again Ripley and a ragtag crew this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers including tough waif Call played by a game Winona Ryder trying to exterminate them And the Alien Ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential I would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy While the settling into tried and true formula is a little disconcerting the formula is tried and true for a reason and Jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon The Alien after all these years is still terrifying and a new breed that is introduced is no less so The violence is appropriately grisly and extreme and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting most notably an extended underwater sequence The film is absolutely mesmerizing visually thanks to the solid work done by production designer Nigel Phelps and cinematographer Darius Khondji As technically adept as Jeunet s direction is perhaps his and for that matter Whedon s greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series A sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for but the self awareness of the excess just adds to the fun No Alien Resurrection is not the great film that Ridley Scott s Alien or the even greater film that James Cameron s Aliens was But after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of Fincher s Alien3 Jeunet s Resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild reckless thrill ride That is what made the Alien series so popular in the first place and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments
10048,Anastasia,1997,Months before its release Fox s epic animated musical Anastasia had been touted as the first legitimate challenge to Disney s animation empire which looked more vulnerable than ever after the disappointing box office and as it turns out merchandising performance of the fun but phoned in Hercules Now that the film has arrived in theatres does the Mouse indeed have reason to worry During its exquisite first twenty or so minutes I found myself agreeing with the buzz but the film soon collapses under the weight of convention becoming a merely pleasant entertainment A harrowing prologue set in 1916 swiftly gives us the necessary backstory during a revolution the entire Russian royal family is killed save for the czar s youngest daughter Anastasia spoken by Kirsten Dunst sung by Lacey Chabert who is lost after escaping from the palace and her grandmother Dowager Empress Marie Angela Lansbury who left Russia for Paris just before the unrest Then the film flashes forward in time jumping into its buoyant opening number A Rumor in St Petersburg which introduces the main action the presumed dead princess is rumored to be alive and with their eye on a possible financial reward from the Empress con men Dimitri spoken by John Cusack sung by Jonathan Dokuchitz and Vladimir Kelsey Grammer seek out a young woman who can be a believable Anastasia stand in While a big opening production number is part of the Disney formula directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman approach it in a fresh way In Disney films the characters do little more than sing and slightly sway to the music here the style is more live action Broadway and MGM with background characters forming a full on dance chorus spontaneously breaking into heavily choreographed moves Dimitri and Vlad ultimately find their perfect impostor in orphan Anya spoken by Meg Ryan sung by Liz Callaway and that s no accident she truly _is_ Anastasia but with barely any recollection of her royal past Freshly released from an unpleasant orphanage Anya articulates her dream of having a family in the stirring Journey to the Past This number is equivalent to the Disney I Want song in function but once again the stage influenced execution sets it apart with Anya literally prancing her way through the snow covered forest and even capping her song by dramatically raising her arms into the air you almost expect the movie to pause for audience applause Right before Anya meets up with the scheming duo comes a truly stunning magical moment as it turns out the film s way too premature peak She steps foot in the ballroom of the abandoned palace crooning the hauntingly beautiful Once Upon a December a lullaby her grandmother used to sing with her when she was young After a single verse the ghosts of the past waltz in through the windows enveloping her creating a lavish ball out of thin air By this song s end the glitter and glamour disappears and so does much of the luster of the film The songs by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens the latter of whom holds a special place in my and many others hearts for her enduring work on ABC s Schoolhouse Rock become increasingly forgettable and even worse the story loses some steam The strict adherence to the established Disney formula becomes a hindrance There is really no dramatic need to include an out and out villain in the piece but true to convention there is one evil monk Rasputin spoken by Christopher Lloyd sung by Jim Cummings whose supernatural curse on the royal family caused its near destruction While the dying Rasputin s plot does lead to some standout sequences in particular a suspenseful and spectacular sea storm scene and the running gag of his body parts constantly fall off is amusing I never felt as if he and his sidekick wisecracking albino bat Bartok Hank Azaria played a necessary role in this story they seemed to be shoehorned in for formula s sake More interesting and involving than the good versus evil plot is the romantic sparring between Anya and Dimitri this may sound odd but Ryan and Cusack generate a lot of chemistry with their voices But the resolution to their romance is far from satisfying Instead of being moved by the ending I was merely pleased One thing however does remain consistently impressive throughout Anastasia and that is the visuals The animation is a little ragged and not nearly as fluid as Disney work but the artwork is outstanding From its beautiful handdrawn images to the three dimensional computer generated work all shot in the 2 35 1 CinemaScope aspect ratio the first animated feature to be shot so since 1959 s Sleeping Beauty Anastasia truly looks and feels like an epic even when the goings on are less so In the end the heavily hyped Anastasia does not announce Fox s animation division as a challenger to Disney s throne What it does announce however is Fox as a _potential_ challenger Anastasia may not be great but it is good and if the film is a jumping off point for the fledgling animation house the Mouse should be prepared for a war
10049,Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas,1997,Beauty the Beast The Enchanted Christmas Our rating Three lava lamps out of five By now we ve all gotten used to the Disney Plan for Animation Release an animated movie with as many possible elements in common with previously successful films and if it takes off release sequels to video With really successful movies like Aladdin those sequels may even spawn a television cartoon series Unfortunately the direct to video sequels thus far have been disappointing The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves while commercially successful were rather pale knockoffs of the original in story song and animation By the time King of Thieves came out we were ready to give up on Disney s OAV original animated video efforts for good This winter however Disney has released Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas While it s still not in the same league as the original film it is a much better effort than either of the two Aladdin videos When we heard about this sequel to Beauty and the Beast we were concerned that any film taking place after the original would not feature the Beast who was a large part of the appeal of the first movie Fortunately this movie takes place during the winter montage of the original film it is presented as an untold chapter Thus all of the original characters are present and with their original voices including Jerry Orbach Angela Lansbury David Ogden Stiers Also present are several new characters with equally impressive voice actors And let us not forget the inimitable Frank Welker man of a thousand voices most of them attributed to animals As Christmas approaches during Belle s first few months in the Beast s castle the enchanted servants inform her that the Beast has forbidden the celebration of Christmas in the castle It was on Christmas Day that the self serving prince turned away the enchantress in disguise and was placed under a spell transorming him into the Beast Not wanting to celebrate the day of his own downfall he calls a halt to Christmas Belle of course plans a Christmas celebration without him enlisting the help of the various servants turned household objects This leads to the introduction of Angelique Bernadette Peters the castle s former decorator now transformed into an Angel tree topper Excited at the prospect of celebrating Christmas once again an initially reluctant Angelique and the other servants begin to decorate the castle and make preparations Unfortunately some of the castle s residents are conspiring to ruin Belle s Christmas These residents are Maestro Forte and Fife a pipe organ and piccolo who don t quite fit in with the rest of castle life Maestro Forte voiced by Tim Curry was once the court composer with a penchant for gloomy compositions Fife Paul Reubens is Forte s crony doing Forte s dirty work at the promise of a solo written expressly for the piccolo Because the Beast s depression has turned him on to Forte s dark music Forte feels the need to defend his newfound territory even if it means killing Belle In the end of course there will be a happy ending because this is not only a Disney film it s a Disney film about Christmas As we mentioned before the first thing to suffer in previous Disney OAV sequels was the animation Characters became distorted the frame rate dropped tremendously and the backgrounds were just plain shoddy Fortunately Enchanted Christmas doesn t suffer as much Most of the character animation while not theater quality is well above average and the character design has barely changed We think we can detect a slight change in Belle but the other characters are flawless The specialty animation including the entirely computer animated Maestro Forte is dazzling Several musical sequences feature uniquely animated segments that are distinct from the rest of the film and quite memorable Watch for Belle s storybook sequence and the ectoplasmic Cupids in Forte s big song The music too is above par The tunes in the Aladdin sequels were either forgettable or based on tunes from the original film but these songs are both original and memorable We would have liked to have heard more from Bernadette Peters one of the most accomplished singers in voice acting but she was given at least one big number so we did get something Like all Disney movies Enchanted Christmas has a message and it hammers away at that message until all viewers are guaranteed to remember it Fortunately this film s message is the same on multiple levels just as Belle reminds us that Christmas represents hope so too does Enchanted Christmas represent hope for quality OAVs from Disney Okay Mickey don t drop the ball now
1005,Switch,1991,An interesting movie That s the least I could say about SWITCH a new comedy from the man who brought us VICTOR VICTORIA and 10 the one and only Blake Edwards Blake Edwards has quite a reputation for directing the awkward and uncomfortable and he has done a good job directing Ellen Barkin in this film I humbly think that this movie could do wonders for Barkin but for Edwards I don t think it will have such a profound impact SWITCH is the story of womanizer Steve Brooks Steve has been rotten to women all his life treating them as if they were objects to be played with and enjoyed Every female he has ever come in contact with hates his guts So one night three of his former girlfriends decide to throw him a surprise party which they notify him of The surprise however is a big one it s his death Now that Steve is stuck in purgatory God must decide whether or not he goes to heaven or hell good move by Edwards making God s voice both male and female it satisfies everyone Since he is on equal footing on both good and bad deeds God decides to send him back to Earth and challenges him to find just one female that likes him If he does he goes to heaven If not well you know But the devil intervenes saying he has as much a right to Steve as God does and if he comes back as a man it will be too easy for him So the devil suggests a rather interesting idea he should come back as a woman So I ve spoiled the first part of the story I won t spoil the rest of it This movie had enormous potential for even more funny scenes than the ones already in it don t get me wrong it has it s fair share and it explores several issues about what it s like being a woman but it never really follows through on most of them I think the problem is that there is so much that can happen to a man in a woman s body that every possible situation could not fit into one movie The ones Edwards does explore are some pretty awkward situations and he handles them quite well I cannot say enough about Ellen Barkin s performance She always had a little touch of stereotypical masculinity in her acting which makes me think Edwards wrote this screenplay with her in mind and it makes her perfect for this role She talks like a man sits like a man and even walks like one very convincingly She does everything I think a man would do in a woman s body without realizing it and it provides for some very funny scenes Barkin was superb tremendous excellent The story however is a bit rushed As I said before there s only so much that can happen in one movie One thing happens right after the other as though Edwards wanted to get in as much as he can The closest movie to this one that Edwards had made previously would have to be VICTOR VICTORIA which dealt with male homosexuality SWITCH deals somewhat with female homosexuality but in a relativistic sort of way in one way it s not homosexuality because the subject is a man in a woman s body but on the other hand he is a woman through and through And in my opinion the film does not deal with it enough Perhaps Edwards should have focused only on what it s like to be a woman and not have introduced the lesbian aspect That would have made room for some more funny situations Also although it might be trivial I must mention that I found the scenes where any of the characters are drunk to be unconvincing They acted as if they had a subtle form of hiccups But all in all they did pretty good SWITCH is definitely better than some of Edwards previous movies a la A FINE MESS but not better than all of them I believe it is a worthy candidate for induction into the Blake Edwards Hall of Fame I think this film might wind up being compared extensively to TOOTSIE with Dustin Hoffman by the critics as it is the closest relative as far as the plot line goes As far as this comparison is concerned SWITCH does not stand on its own Nevertheless it is a good movie and worthy of at least matinee price at the box office
10050,Alien: Resurrection,1997,If you talk to some people they ll say Ridley Scott s ALIEN was the best of the series which went downhill after that Talk to others and they ll tell you that James Cameron s thrill ride masterpiece ALIENS was where the series peaked If anyone tells you ALIEN 3 was the best of the lot call the nearest mental hospital and tell them you ve found their missing patient Fans of the first two films will invariably join forces to gang up on that installment directed by music video director David Fincher Four years have gone by since that fiasco but the fans memories have not disappeared so while the latest movie ALIEN RESURRECTION is approached with high hopes it is also approached with a certain wariness Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver the glue that held the series together was killed off in ALIEN 3 taking her own life just as one of those fearsome creatures came bursting out of her chest As she fell toward a fiery pit of molten metal she seemed to caress the baby alien as her own baby embracing the enemy which had haunted her through six hours of cinema over fourteen years A little corny Perhaps but it seemed a fitting closure to a series which had garnered a lot of fans and their spending cash Of course an ALIEN movie would not be the same without the venerable Ripley so in this new film they resurrect her Hence the name In ALIEN RESURRECTION Ripley is not really Ripley but a clone generated a couple hundred years later from the first Ripley s own tissue that had been saved from the planet on which she died The people cloning her are from a military business conglomerate which hopes to use the aliens for the purposes of research and general killing as the ultimate weapon This clone seems to pick up right where the late Ripley left off complete with gestating alien and the first scenes of the movie show the medical personnel aboard a gigantic research vessel removing the baby from Ripley s chest Following the operation the host seems to be doing fine so hey they decide to keep her around too The research vessel is commanded by General Perez Dan Hedaya who has contracted a freelance freighter crew to deliver a number of people hijacked while in cryo stasis whom Dr Wren J E Freeman plans to use as hosts to breed more aliens You see the alien taken out of Ripley s chest is a queen and by this time is already laying eggs The freighter crew is your usual band of misfits There s Elgyn Michael Wincott the tough leader of the group Vriess Dominique Pinon Elgyn s lover and first mate of the freighter Johner Ron Pearlman the all brawn no brain type Christie Gary Dourdan the techno wiz and Hilliard Kim Flowers who doesn t seem to be part of the crew for any other reason than he s in a wheelchair and therefore adds a little color to the group Then there s Annalee Call Winona Ryder another member of the group who s apparently just tagging along for reasons which aren t really explained until later but those motivations apparently weren t revealed to the crew before she was taken on board These people react to their surroundings with the predictable suspicion of authority and of course there s the compulsory scene where one of the visiting crew finds the supply room and loots it There s really not much we haven t seen before and you can almost pick out the characters who are going to die within the first hour of the film And die they do Pretty soon the baby aliens are full grown and find a particularly ingenious way of escaping their confines Shortly thereafter they are up to their usual mischief killing here snatching there and overall looking really mean So of course it s up to Ripley to save the survivors by leading them to their only means of escape the freighter on which our rag tag band arrived I think it would have been cute for director Jean Pierre Jeunet to have paid an homage to STAR WARS and have Ripley say ala Princess Leia You came in that thing You re braver than I thought At least that would have been unexpected ALIEN RESURRECTION contains a whole bunch of things you just knew were going to happen because you ve seen it happen in the previous films From these re treads you can publish a doctrine on what not to do when there are aliens on your spaceship 1 Don t go looking into holes made by the aliens They will probably grab you from their hiding place just to the side of the hole 2 If you find some goo on the floor don t spend time staring at it and going Ewww Instead run away fast There s an alien nearby 3 Don t walk on floor gratings only walk on solid floors With gratings an alien is probably looking at you from below and will pull the gratings away and grab you from underneath 4 Always assume the alien is right behind you The moment you think it s not there it will come out of the darkness hiss at you and bite your head Most of the performances turned in by the cast are pretty two dimensional but it s not really the fault of the actors given what they had to work with Most of the characters are paper thin and just fill up slots with only Winona Ryder given the slightest chance to exercise any real acting ability Even then her character s catharsis is decidedly forced since the reason for her being on the ship are justified only by a flimsy motivation Sigourney Weaver however gets to play her character in a different way than in previous movies First Ripley s got all the experience from dealing with the aliens in the past and therefore she s more intuitive with regard to the aliens behavior Second through the cloning process Ripley is actually part alien and therefore can sense where the aliens are and even when the queen is in pain While intriguing this limits the amount of fear she has of the aliens and therefore the amount of tension we have as an audience Sure we can watch as the other characters get frightened by the aliens but since they have no depth we don t really care if they re frightened or even if they live or die The aliens themselves are the best they have ever looked and credit must be given to the creature crew on this one There are computer generated aliens too and they also look a lot better than in ALIEN 3 where shots of the CGI alien were all too fake One noticeable change from the previous films is that we see the aliens very clearly in this movie in rooms which are decently lit Although this helps to show off the wonderful alien artistry it also somewhat defeats the suspense generated from knowing there is something out in the murky darkness but not being quite able to see it As a result we become so familiar with their appearances that they aren t all that scary when they subsequently show up throughout the film Altogether ALIEN RESURRECTION shows that the franchise is running out of plot ideas and there are only so many times you can take the same person running from the same aliens While a better film than ALIEN 3 ALIEN RESURRECTION doesn t have what it takes to give the series the shot in the arm it needs so if there is to be a fifth movie it s going to have to be something really special
10052,Little Mermaid The,1989,THE LITTLE MERMAID Walt Disney Pictures 1989 Voices by Jodi Benson Samuel E Wright Pat Carroll Christopher Daniel Barnes Buddy Hackett Kenneth Mars Jason Marin Screenplay by Ron Clements John Musker based on the story by Hans Christian Andersen Produced by Howard Ashman John Musker Directed by Ron Clements John Musker Running time 82 minutes Note Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers Be forewarned It s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual Disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth THE LION KING had just cracked 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks ALADDIN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Since then though Disney s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns with POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and this year s HERCULES successively proving less and less potent With the once seemingly impregnable Disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from Fox s ANASTASIA Disney has brought Xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation THE LITTLE MERMAID While the animation for the film is as is typically the case for Disney films unquestionably top notch the magic in THE LITTLE MERMAID is not its animation but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music The film s storyline is fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man except in this case the chaperone is a crab the teen is a young mermaid and the object of her desire is a human prince What makes THE LITTLE MERMAID so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions From the moment mermaid Ariel lays her eyes on Prince Eric she s resolutely smitten and she s such a pure and endearing character that one can t help but invest their heart with her This simple but touching love story coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour makes THE LITTLE MERMAID a remarkably captivating picture One of the interesting things about THE LITTLE MERMAID is something which now curiously dates it the voices cast for its motley crew of characters This film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue which started to a certain degree with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and was irrevocably exacerbated by Robin Williams much heralded turn in ALADDIN by the release of THE LION KING and henceforth the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities While it s understandable that animated features lacking the name recognition or drawing power of Disney say BALTO s use of Kevin Bacon and Bridget Fonda or even ANASTASIA s showcasing of Meg Ryan and John Cusack would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products it s unfortunate that even Disney has embraced this policy Do we really need to hear say Demi Moore as Esmerelda in THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME Is the film s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice rather than a voice which best suits the role I m not exactly on the edge of my seat for Eddie Murphy in the upcoming MULAN Fortunately the performers who voice the characters in THE LITTLE MERMAID although perhaps more obscure are impeccably cast Chief among them is Jodi Benson a 1992 Tony nominee for her stage work in CRAZY FOR YOU who voices the film s heroine Ariel to perfection with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor and gorgeous singing voice Ms Benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film She s the only reason I d even consider catching FLUBBER Similarly Samuel E Wright is terrific in the showy role of Sebastian the weary guardian crab He easily milks his lovable character s comic moments for all they re worth and his rendering of two of THE LITTLE MERMAID s big tunes Under The Sea and Kiss The Girl have become the stuff of legend Pat Carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea witch Ursula while Kenneth Mars booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of Ariel s father King Triton In large roles and small Edie McClurg as dotting busybody Carlotta is ideal and Rene Auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant French chef THE LITTLE MERMAID is impeccably cast Of course THE LITTLE MERMAID will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of Alan Menken music and Howard Ashman lyrics who had created LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and would go on to compose BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and ALADDIN for Disney before Mr Ashman s untimely death Not only are Mr Menken s tunes unbearably catchy but Mr Ashman s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character s dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film Mr Menken s score for the film is equally top notch the sequence where Eric voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes and Ariel tour his kingdom in a horse drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with Mr Menken s fine score It appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso styled Under The Sea as joyfully crooned by Mr Wright which won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards for Best Song indeed one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune but my favourite is Ms Benson s heartfelt rendition of the ballad Part Of Your World an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope wonderfully lyricized by Mr Ashman which accompanied by the film s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes During the song s reprise which builds to a crescendo with Ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history As of this writing November 1997 has come to an end as has Disney s limited 17 day re release of THE LITTLE MERMAID There s no question that the primary motivation for if not the film s reissue itself at least its timing was to reinforce Disney s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to Fox s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture ANASTASIA In every respect the re release of THE LITTLE MERMAID appears to be a success the film s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic 100 million mark THE LITTLE MERMAID proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video pulling in close to 10 million in its opening weekend and although nobody could possibly expect THE LITTLE MERMAID to possibly defeat the aggressively marketed ANASTASIA in head to head competition it siphoned enough from the Fox film s opening weekend totals to keep ANASTASIA from the coveted weekend leader spot allowing for Disney s odious FLUBBER to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away But although Disney s motives in the reissue of THE LITTLE MERMAID were self serving and protectionist the real winner is the public Any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one and it s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen THE LITTLE MERMAID is the best film to come out of the Disney s modern animation renaissance and one of the greatest animated films ever made
10054,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,1997,Mortal Kombat Annihilation A rather lengthy movie review by Josh Hammonds Capsule Not as bad a sequel as Crow 2 or Batman Robin but still horribly putrid cheesy and ill conceived This one belongs in Saturday morning cartoons Extended Review You know about halfway through this movie I realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes you d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy Hong Kong style martial arts Beautifully choreographed by Robin Shou who also plays Liu Kang the fight scenes are both mind blowing and graceful acrobatic enough to make Olympic gymnasts weep This is what made the original so fun but unfortunately for the sequel we are without the frenetic directorial style of Paul Anderson Instead they got John R Leonetti the cinematographer for the original Mortal Kombat Not a good choice While the fight scenes are brutal and eye popping the rest of the movie looks like standard made for TV fare The acting is sub par which I could endure if it were not for A the director s style B the special effects C the treatment of the story and characters A Mr Leonetti should go back to lighting in my opinion I could say dozens of bad things about him he way overuses slow motion he has no eye for action he can t get even mediocre performances out of actors and so on But by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping Apparantly everybody can now fly Hell I m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot but not when it happens every few minutes and is done so poorly Better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in Xena Warrior Princess In short they should have gotten Paul Anderson back Or at least let Robin Shou direct B Unlike the first one whose SFX were vibrant and somewhat realistic MK A s special effects are bland fake looking and overall just plain bad I counted at least half a dozen times that blue screening was painfully obvious Had this movie been made in the 80 s it would have been ground breaking But in today s industry it doesn t even look finished C Now for the _REALLY_ bad parts I admit I m an avid fan of the Mortal Kombat series The games are amusing diversions an easy way to work off stress and anger The first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride This could have been a really cool movie It isn t The writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers Some of the plot elements are just plain stupid How stupid Take for instance how our heroes move around They use giants spheres the roll around underground supposedly at thousands of miles per hour oh boy Even worse is the treatment of secondary characters Blink and you ll miss em Most characters had more depth in the video games If you thought Batman Robin was bad about this you ain t seen nothin yet A good 75 of the characters are introduced kick somebody around a bit then either die or are forgotten about There s no explanation at all for this And for the final blasphemy the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of ended It almost made me weep To sum it all up rent it on video and fast forward through everything except the fight scenes
10055,Fools Rush In,1997,Doug Draizin and Anna Marie Davis co producers of Fools Rush In manage to put together a spirited and beguiling romantic comedy based on a true story apparently their own Whether their meeting happened exactly as the movie shows is probably the least of the concerns of the average moviegoer who probably won t even know this little tidbit which incidentally might serve them well in the next movie trivia pursuit they partake in What they will be aware of is the chemistry between the two leads as well as the lively banter between their best friends and the overall sweetness and fluid direction of Fools Friends fanatic will immediately recognize Alex Whitman as Matthew Perry though the more devout Perry fan will no doubt see him as Chandler Bing on on the big screen That s not a bad thing since He often has the funniest moments in the sit com Perry s character is little more than Chandler on the big screen but the antics and dry sarcasm that make him the most popular male on the TV show works well in this movie He is well supported by the sensual Salma Hayek whose presence bellies her otherwise petite frame she s 5 2 The fun starts in New York where we re introduced to a career driven Whitman who works for a NY based night club construction firm who ends up with a gig to oversee construction of a ritzy night club right on the Vegas Strip The viewer gets an inital taste of his quick wit which is the source of much of the entertainment throughout the movie It s this style of verbal humor that allows Perry to pull off seemingly innocuous lines into amusing zingers The film is riddled with lines like gee that sounded so much prettier in Spanish Lines that would sound otherwise ordinary with any other actor During his first few nights in Vegas while standing in line for a unisex bathroom is where he comes across the spunky Isabel Fuentes a beautiful photographer of Mexican decent After their initial encounter the director cuts immediately to the morning after of their one night stand where we see her wake up next to a dozing Alex and gets that all too familiar Oh my God look Therein lies the turning point Three months later she shows up and tells Alex she s pregnant with his child We re treated to a short yet amusing spiel from Alex about a condom s reason for being Distraught she leaves he chases her wanting to help and ends up that same evening eating at her parent s place for a family dinner Apparently her idea of family involves cousins aunts uncle and probably the Mormon Tabernacle Choir Alex on the other hand visits his parents only during holidays and stuff Alex manages to enjoy himself immensely so much so that he decides he and Isabelle should get married The proposal itself is a riot with him proclaiming you re everything I never knew I always wanted Both poignant and hilarious even Isabelle displays amusement albeit a slight bewildered smile In typical Vegas fashion they get married in a chapel with Elvis as a witness More hilarity ensues when Alex s parents played by Jill Clayburgh and John Bennet Perry Matthew s real father decide to make a surprise visit Being the quintessential New York WASP ish type they initially mistake Isabel for a housekeeper They do find out and she s actually a wife and agree to a parent meeting The cultural difference issues that seem to be so prevalent throughout the movie is shown here with a deft touch by Tennant the most entertaining being the back and forth between the two fathers As with most marriages there will be conflicts the fights and make ups are also done in ways that are easily believable And while all this is going on we re treated to a bit of insight about the two leads from the goings on around them Whether it s Alex s job old crushes construction difficulties jealous ex boyfriends or being surrounded by snakes in the desert Jon Tenney also provides some moments of humor as Alex s libidinous recently divorced best friend Fools Rush In is clearly blessed by the expert casting of the romantic duo You can almost feel the chemistry between Perry and Hayek throughout the entire movie Their acting and charm is what makes the entire movie seem so real Their relationship is well paced and developed in a manner that is plausible considering their near shotgun wedding Both are shown as real people having a real depth and substance Tennant deserves a bit of the credit for his skilled direction We re treated to quite a few musical montages as well several sweeping views of Vegas the Hoover Dam and especially stunning scenes of the desert He does an especially good job of letting Hayek radiate through the lens The slow motion shots of Isabel looking lovingly at Alex is subtle yet but go so far in showing Hayek s sensuality You can truly read what s on her mind just by looking at her face Fools is an immensely enjoyable film perfect for those romantic evenings with a significant other Its Valentine s Day release earlier this year could not have been more perfect Few romantic comedies contain such a well blended combination of humor passion and believability Check it out
10056,Bent,1997,Cast Clive Owen Lothaire Bluteau Brian Webber Ian McKellen Mick Jagger Director Sean Mathias Producers Dixie Linder Michael Solinger Screenplay Martin Sherman based on his play Cinematography Yorgos Arvanitis Music Philip Glass U S Distributor Samuel Goldwyn It has long been recognized that Hitler s final solution exterminated more than Jews Gypsies and homosexuals were also routinely prodded onto trains like cattle and sent off to ovens and gas showers To this date most films have examined the tragedy from the Jewish point of view A select few such as Steven Spielberg s Oscar winning SCHINDLER S LIST have presented the truth with heartbreaking gut wrenching clarity Rarely however has a motion picture attempted what BENT does show the Holocaust through the eyes of two gay men enduring a grueling existence at the Dachau concentration camp Unfortunately what begins with an interesting premise and a promising first half quickly devolves into a boring muddled melodramatic love story BENT is based on the 1979 stage play of the same name By all accounts the live version is both startling and moving The motion picture version is neither something critical was lost in the translation even though playwright Martin Sherman wrote the screenplay Many of the things that can work in a play when the live nature of the production allows an intimate rapport to develop between the actors and the audience fail on the big screen The final fifty minutes of BENT are a prime example The movie s first half is more successful It introduces us to a pair of gay lovers living out their lives in Berlin during the late 1930s They are Max Clive Owen the black sheep of a wealthy family and Rudy Brian Webber and effeminate dancer Together the two spend their nights at Greta s a dive run by a transvestite Mick Jagger While Rudy performs Max drinks snorts cocaine and picks up men for quick sex That lifestyle ends however when Hitler orders homosexuals sent to concentration camps Despite pleas from his uncle Ian McKellen Max refuses to flee Germany unless he can get Rudy out with him Ultimately both men are caught and sent to Dachau En route Max is befriended by a timid gay man named Horst Lothaire Bluteau who advises him not to acknowledge his lover if he wishes to remain alive Following that advice allows Max to survive after Rudy is beaten to death Later by performing with a young girl to convince the Nazis of his heterosexuality Max is able to upgrade his status from that of a homosexual who must wear a pink triangle to that of a Jew who wears a yellow star Once the movie reaches Dachau it grinds to a screeching halt The remainder of BENT concentrates on the relationship between Max and Horst They meet in the yard every day moving rocks back and forth in an example of pointless monotony This particular activity is not inherently cinematic in nature and BENT s banal repetitious dialogue does little to liven it up Gradually the tediousness of the second half sucks all of the potential drama not to mention the energy out of the film We give up caring whether the characters live or die They don t have anything interesting to say and the scene in which they engage in verbal sex borders on being unintentionally funny Solid performances from lead actors Clive Owen and Lothaire Bluteau go in vain The final scene which is supposed to be a triumphant crowd pleaser comes across as obvious and overplayed One thing I don t doubt is director Sean Mathias sincerity BENT is obviously an important story for him it s just that he and writer Martin Sherman made too many bad choices in adapting the play Instead of being a revealing look at one often neglected group of Hitler s victims BENT turns into a lifeless preachy love story where the characters lose their connection with the audience the longer they remain on screen In fact BENT s most important contribution may be to illustrate by comparison how powerful a movie like SCHINDLER S LIST truly is For me the cinema is not a slice of life but a piece of cake
10057,Beaumarchais linsolent,1996,It was a crazy time in France what with the French revolution right around the corner King Louis XV would soon die and his son would become King Louis XVI Such is the setting for BEAUMARCHAIS THE SCOUNDREL about the controversial playwright spy and playboy Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais Beaumarchais was the author of the plays The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro Today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas but back in 1773 when the movie takes place they were so scandalous that Beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once The movie BEAUMARCHAIS THE SCOUNDREL takes a light hearted approach to its subject resulting in an inviting motion picture One of France s most expensive productions ever the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year Now in theatrical release in the United States it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story The secret of the film s success other than the lavishness of Sylvie De Segonzac s costumes has to be the performance by Fabrice Luchini as Beaumarchais With his glistening eyes and his infectious smile he mesmerizes the camera and the audience His wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning In a land where court intrigue determines one s destiny constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy As our story starts we learn that Beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship Into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight Beaumarchais who has been having an affair with the man s wife makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided That over with the fight is on With Luchini s charisma it is hard to root for anyone other than him Audiences may remember him from the marvelous COLONEL CHABERT in which he played the attorney Although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant Gudin played by Manuel Blanc he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style Michael Epp s warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to Jean Marc Kerdelhue s lush but realistic looking sets Jean Claude Petit s music especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos make for an enchanting time at the movies Director Jean Claude Brisville who wrote the script along with Edouard Molinaro fleshed out a play by Sacha Guitry which according to the press notes was just a series of historic vignettes The disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie but the actors smooth it over with their good hearted style Typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund Benjamin Franklin appears in a large pot of hot water taking his bath One episode has Beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man Another has Beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the American revolution All of this may sound like a dull historical drama but it is anything but The story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts The radiantly lovely Sandrine Kiberlain plays Marie Therese the real love of Beaumarchais s life But he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him Still with his beguiling smile one can never quite be sure if you should trust him The movie on the other hand can be trusted to deliver a high old time BEAUMARCHAIS THE SCOUNDREL runs 1 41 It is in French with English subtitles The film is not rated but would be an R for some nudity and sex and should be fine for most teenagers
10058,Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,1992,We did everything we brought everything there s nothing to worry about the father reassures the mother Yeah yeah you re right she replies not completely convinced It s another Christmas trip for the large McCallister family and yes they ve managed to lose Kevin again this year not that Kevin minds My family s in Florida and I m in New York Kevin our young adventurer tells the audience as he raises his eyebrows Unsupervised Kevin is living the life of Riley in an enormous suite at Manhattan s plush Plaza Hotel thanks to his Dad s credit card Holed up in his fancy digs he orders everything and I do mean everything off of the room service menu while he wiles away his time watching television Do you know how the TV works sir the unctuous bellman asked him earlier while showing him the room Are you kidding Kevin shot back I m 10 years old Television is my life Welcome to 1992 s HOME ALONE 2 LOST IN NEW YORK the sequel to 1990 s wildly popular HOME ALONE starring Macaulay Culkin as the cherubic looking but devilishly resourceful Kevin The movie has two distinct parts In the first Kevin lives a dream life as a kid seemingly as wealthy as Donald Trump who does a nice cameo in the movie He even rents a white stretched limo to take him to a toy store for shopping The limo is fully stocked right down to the hot cheese pizza In a wonderful contrast to the picture postcard perfect snow encrusted New York with the city lights glistening his family arrives at their very cheap Miami motel to a torrential downpour New York City can be a magically beautiful place and this film shows it off to maximum advantage Seeing the images in the movie is almost enough to make New Yorkers cancel their winter trips to Florida and stay in the city Culkin gives a surprisingly subtle and self assured performance He owns the show but shows none of the cockiness of child actors whose success has gone to their heads The second half of the movie is devoted to the battle between the kid and the criminals played again by Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Stern as Marv and is all too predictable and slapstick Although not nearly as enjoyable as the sweet first part it does deliver on some nice childish humor After a while however the second part degenerates into one repetitive bonk on the head scene after another and becomes increasingly tiring What can he do Marv tells Harry about their nemesis Kevin He s a kid Kids are helpless In the story s big showdown Kevin booby traps his uncle s vacant apartment and proves again that he is much smarter than these two dumb crooks Award winning actress Brenda Frica appears in a touching role as the Pigeon Lady in Central Park When Kevin dares to speak to her no one else ever does they become instant friends What kind of idiots do you have working here Kevin s mother asks at the hotel where he has been allowed to stay on his own The finest in New York claims the front desk clerk This picture is one of the better idiotic kids movies which admittedly is not exactly a rousing recommendation HOME ALONE 2 LOST IN NEW YORK runs too long at 2 00 It is rated PG for cartoonish violence The film would be fine for kids around 6 and up
1006,Spartacus,1960,SPARTACUS is Stanley Kubrick s classic epic about a slave rebellion in republican Rome It was originally released in I think 1960 to tepid reviews and packed houses Of the major Academy awards best picture director actor actress it was nominated only for best picture in all it won four Oscars including Best Supporting Actor for Peter Ustinov Despite its cold reception from the Academy it was the biggest money maker of its release year On May 3 a restored SPARTACUS was released in several U S cities including Seattle I played hookey from work and Lyndol and I spent three and a half happy hours on a glorious spring day in the dark of one of Seattle s largest houses watching a SPARTACUS that was even more wonderful than it was when I saw it first run at the age of 15 or 16 I hope you get a chance to see this the second greatest epic Hollywood ever made LAWRENCE OF ARABIA being the greatest by most and my accounting One of the reasons it is better this time around is it includes a now famous scene where Crassus Lawrence Olivier makes a pass at his body slave Antoninus Tony Curtis The story is that Olivier insisted that the scene be filmed even though Kubrick and the others knew that the scene was unreleasable so the soundtrack was never recorded For the restoration the scene was found in tact in the three color separations used to reconstruct the negative the original negative having long since been allowed to disintegrate Curtis dubbed his dialog by pitching his voice higher and Anthony Hopkins dubbed Olivier s dialog seamlessly The scene is fascinating in its delicacy and indirection its talk of having appetites for oysters or snails or both as an historical footnote on the presentation of homosexuality in the films More importantly in terms of the overall film it goes a long ways toward filling out Curtis s character as well as his sudden appearance among the volunteers joining Spartacus and the other escaped gladiators on slopes of Mt Vesuvius I never really understood Antoninus before Another reason why SPARTACUS is better the second time around is that I am older and I understand the subtext now As a teenager I reacted merely to the spectacle As an old fart I now react to the theme of personal freedom that informs the entire movie The script was written Dalton Trumbo the great film writer who was blacklisted during the Red Scare of the late Forties He had survived for years by selling scripts through fronts and by using noms de plume I understand he actually was given a writing Oscar under an alias He could not enter any studio in Hollywood Meetings had to be held in private homes Stanley Kubrick to his everlasting credit got tired of the hyprocrisy issued Trumbo a gatepass one day and used Trumbo s real name on the screen credits I tell you it gave me a catch in the throat to see the credit to see Dalton Trumbo proudly defiantly displayed in those huge 70 mm letters Just as the theme is human liberty so the background of the film itself recapitulates the theme Trumbo said he knew the studio wouldn t go for the obvious stuff like the scene mentioned previously and choked on the slight nudity and sex Jean Simmons has two coy nude scenes that were highly controversial in their day with the Legion of Decency and other bluenoses but he knew the studio execs weren t astute enough to understand the really controversial aspect of the film its theme This theme is just as resonant today as it was then when SPARTACUS marked the official end of the McCarthy Era A third reason for liking SPARTACUS even more today is that no one makes these wonderful sweeping 70 mm epics today Thirty years ago the budget originally called for 12 million you could not bring it in for under 200 million today Hollywood made a terrible choice when it turned its greedy back on 70 mm the brilliant clarity of the medium brings tears to the eyes of a movie lover the tears of pain and regret And these epic stars are no longer available either Look at the cast Kirk Douglas Spartacus Laurence Olivier Crassus Jean Simmons Varinnia Charles Laughton Gracchus Peter Ustinov Batiacus John Gavin Julius Caesar Tony Curtis Antoninus and literally a cast of thousands Actors like Douglas and Olivier are more than equal to the challenge of the epic medium Gavin was the weakest of the principals but gosh he was handsome what happened to him old farts want to know Jean Simmons was a marvel of strength and delicacy a stronger version of Audrey Hepburn who didn t find real strength until she became middle aged But the absolute treats are Laughton and Ustinov who have two scenes together that ought to be required viewing for all interested in acting for the screen SPARTACUS was restored by the same team that restored LAWRENCE OF ARABIA the restoration that sparked the current wave of restored classics This is more than recommended this is required viewing Breaking the Hollywood Blacklist The darkest chapter of the American entertainment industry was the years of the Hollywood blacklist People accused of disloyalty to the government could not confront their accusers but would suddenly find that nobody would hire them Careers were destroyed by innuendo One blacklisted writer was Dalton Trumbo Before the years of the blacklist he was a successful screenwriters but when his name appeared on the blacklist he could submit only very few scripts and then only under a pseudonym Then in 1960 two major films were released with screen credit given to Trumbo under his own name On both films the directors and the lead actors risked being blacklisted themselves by insisting to their studios that Trumbo s name appear in the credits in type no smaller than their own When there was no fuss from the public it was generally acknowledged that the blacklist was dead The films were EXODUS and SPARTACUS The directors were Otto Preminger and Stanley Kubrick the stars were Paul Newman and Kirk Douglas
10060,Se7en,1995,Se7en 1995 Rated R for graphic portrayals of grizzly and unusual murders and harsh language Out of 4 stars 4 Stars Starring Morgan Freeman Brad Pitt Gwyneth Paltrow I have never seen a film like SE7EN before in my life I don t think I will see one like it again SE7EN is not just a film it is a work of art My high school drama teacher considers SE7EN the best film he has ever seen This statement from one of my favorite teachers sparked my interest in this film I had heard other critics give it great reviews and then others gave it lesser reviews However since my teacher has great taste in film I decided to see what all the hype was about My expectations were set very high for this film and not only did it reach those expectations but it far exceeded them SE7EN is definitely one of the best films ever made SE7EN is directed by David Fincher the creator of ALIEN 3 and the new film THE GAME When first released SE7EN became an enormous box office hit because it finally did something most audiences had never seen for a long time it dazzled us with spectacular visuals and enthralled us with a frightening story Not only did it gain popularity with audiences but it sparked controversy over many of the graphic murders portrayed If you don t know by now SE7EN centers its plot around a killer who bides by the Seven Deadly Sins Sure this is a very original idea but we have all seen serial killer movies before However we have never seen one done so thoroughly or emotionally involving Fincher knows exactly how to play with his audience and their emotions He creates interesting characters that we grow to like and then he spins the film around and makes us sick to our stomach Perhaps what makes SE7EN work isn t necessarily the plot or the characters but the visual accuity of Fincher The title sequence has earned praise for the fast editing symbolism and foreshadowing involved But this is just the start The film opens with a couple moving to New York to begin a new life Detective Mills Brad Pitt and his wife Tracy Gwyneth Paltrow move into a good sized apartment and Mills goes to work alongside veteran and retiring Detective Somerset Morgan Freeman Somerset doesn t exactly take a liking to his new impatient partner but he likes Mills wife They are sent to a murder scene to investigate the brutal and torturous killing of an extremely obese man The man was tied with barbed wire to a chair and forced to eat himself to death The grizzly murder is just the start of an ensuing game of cat and mouse with an undetermined killer as the mouse Clues around the obese man s home reveals the word Gluttony the first of seven murders As these two detectives investigate the murder more show up Sloth Greed Lust Pride One man was forced to cut a pound of his own flesh off and another man was tied to a bed and barely kept alive for one year It soon becomes apparent that the killer might be trying to give a sermon of some kind and as the two detectives get closer to the killer they find their own lives getting mixed into the mess As they get closer to solving the case and catching the killer the preacher s message begins to appear directed more towards Mills and Somerset Mills family life is deteriorating and Somerset gets closer to Tracy who reveals secrets to him that she hasn t even told her husband All of this leads up to the inevitable but shocking conclusion which answers all the questions we have been asking and gives us something to think about on the way out of the theater Revealing the ending would be a mistake and all I will say is that the killer shows up at the police station to turn himself in Why would he turn himself in without finishing his goal Has he already done Wrath and Envy These questions are answered but the answers may not be exactly what we expected or wanted As I have mentioned above SE7EN is mostly a film about mood and atmosphere It rains most of the time and the sets are dark and dreary The victims places are usually lit with dim lights and shadows are cast all around the place Many places are only lit by the detectives flashlights which bounce around the room illuminating key pieces to the plot of which Fincher wants you to see As with THE GAME Fincher is capable of shifting your attention from one thing to another by his camera angles and lighting effects This is one of those films in which you may only want to see on the big screen or the letterbox version on video The big screen holds so many small details which become fuzzy and sometimes unextinguishable on the transition to the small screen However if you are able to get ahold of a copy of a letterbox version of SE7EN I suggest watching it on a big screen TV to get the maximum effect As my drama teacher said about SE7EN You can pause this film at any point take a picture of it and hang it on the wall Like TWELVE MONKEYS SE7EN mixes a fiercely frustrating story with creepy visuals and grotesque murders SE7EN does have some minor flaws although they are hardly noticeable unless you scrutinize over the ending The first hour and a half we never know who the killer is and then he reveals himself in the final thirty minutes This is extremely well done because it doesn t rely on the action ending that so many films as this one would use However a couple plot holes arise from his appearance but it s almost pointless to point them out Besides Fincher s direction and the star power of Pitt Freeman and the mysterious killer who most of us should recognize nowadays give the ending enough speed and power to leap over the holes with the greatest of ease Now that I think about it I don t even know why I brought this up Choosing the correct actors for SE7EN was crucial for the film to work Brad Pitt will probably draw female viewers and Gwyneth Paltrow will draw male viewers However Pitt gives a stunning and inspired performance proving that he isn t just another pretty face Freeman on the other hand steals the film as the veteran detective His poetic dialogue is given an added touch by Freeman s almost monotonous tone which fits the style of SE7EN Pitt s talkative character gives Freeman the perfect opposite to work with Paltrow is a key to the plot but for most of the film she remains off screen The mysterious killer who gave an uncredited performance is played by an actor who most people know today However taking Roger Ebert s lead I will not reveal his name in my review Pitt and Freeman are the central characters and they fit in with the atmospheric setting Fincher applies to his sets Freeman almost blends into the background while Pitt stands out like a sore thumb My guess is that this is symbolic because of Pitt s kick ass style and Freeman s withdrawn but intelligent character SE7EN is rated R for graphic afterviews of grizzly and gruesome murders and harsh language Fincher has given us a nearly perfect film and he will most likely become a big Hollywood director On seeing SE7EN I almost forgot that it was a commercial film The depth and layers of the story is usually seen in independent features but the graphic killings can be too shocking for some viewers However despite the graphic nature of this film most people will look back at this film and remember the ending Like THE USUAL SUSPECTS the ending shocks everyone and usually creates repeat viewings SE7EN is one of the best films ever made and will be remembered for a long time to come
10063,Alien: Resurrection,1997,Will moviegoers ever get enough of these space creatures whose best attributes are showing off their exceptionally sharp teeth and oozing slime Not yet it seems But that s ok because this fourth installment shows signs of life and once again brings to us the macho Ripley Sigourney Weaver and pits her against those familiar goo dripping acid for blood aliens Science fiction gives writers the latitude to come up with wacky premises and the premise here is certainly odd Despite its viciousness and primal urge to kill it turns out that some people are enamored with this species and hope to breed more of them A complete explanation is never really given it may be a secret government operation or a plan hatched by terrorists However we are made aware of a couple things All of the action will take place on a spaceship replete with the obligatory warehouse like setting dimly lit corridors and smoke billowing out from every angle Ripley is a clone of the original who died in Aliens3 who has heightened senses she can smell the presence of aliens and some memories of her former life realizing all too well the dangerous implications of breeding such a savage species Also it won t be too long despite careful attempts to contain the aliens before they will escape and run rampant through the spaceship that carries them Their infestation is actually startling As they begin to run amuck the ships computer states non human elements detected on levels 2 4 5 9 and so forth while the crew frantically makes their way into the escape pods However as this genre mandates there must be at least a handful of people who have yet to escape Those still on board include the Ripley clone and an assorted bunch of grizzled space dogs including Call Winona Ryder Naturally there is no easy way off and for them things will get much worse before it gets better The true stars in this movie however are the aliens and the special effects people that created them They are incredible to look at An especially fine scene involves an underwater chase where the aliens swim in pursuit of their victims subsequently climb a ladder and then dodge bullets being fired upon them They are intelligent merciless and genuinely imposing Less impressive though is the Ripley clone While she embodies the toughness of a soldier and the tenderness of a human the clone s persona displays a sense of annoying apathy She blurts out cynical sound bites and laughs at the weakness of mankind Also Ryder is a strange addition to this kind of movie Though she is a wonderful actress she lacks the heft and presence to stand alongside Ripley and the other crew members My feelings about this movie were undoubtedly mixed While I enjoyed the beauty of the aliens the moderate amount of excitement and the enormous amounts of slime Ripley s sense of detachment alienated me and soon I found myself less interested in the final result and more interested in seeing more aliens But I suppose that if the focus of the movie was actually on Ripley the title of the film would have been called Ripley Resurrection
10064,Deconstructing Harry,1997,DECONSTRUCTING HARRY Fine Line Features Directed by Woody Allen After such recent frothy forays as Everyone Says I Love You and Mighty Aphrodite it comes as a shock to see Woody Allen deliver Deconstructing Harry a vicious black comedy that calls to mind such earlier Allen as Crimes and Misdemeanors and Stardust Memories Set against those two Harry has a more singular focus than Crimes and is a much more successful examination of a writer s psyche than Stardust By turns clever devestating bitter and delightful this challenging piece of work is easily one of Allen s most mature efforts to date It also offers him an opportunity to play one of his least sympathetic characters Harry Block is a self loathing post middle age novelist whose fiction recalls the work of Philip Roth But Harry has also written a savage roman a clef about the faithless superficial types in his life You take everyone s suffering and turn it into gold accuses Lucy Judy Davis one of Harry s several neurotic ex lovers Unable to cope with the demands of loving relationships any longer Harry now hires prostitutes such as the streetwise Cookie Williams the delightful Hazelle Goodman a weary vixen in pink spandex cut offs and a tie dyed tank top who Harry recruits as his date for a ceremony his former college he was thrown out before graduation so it s not technically his alma mater is holding to honor him Harry doesn t feel much like celebrating however since he s suffering from crippling writer s block During the course of the film often at unexpected moments Harry s stories come to life and we can see for ourselves how Harry combined personality traits from both a chilly ex wife a knockout Kirstie Alley and his rigidly religious sister Caroline Aaron to create the character of Helen who describes herself as the shrewish Jewish hybrid and is marvelously played by an imaginatively cast Demi Moore Harry s isolationism also comes through in his tale of a movie actor Robin Williams who realizes he s somehow become permanently out of focus and is destined to drift through life as a blur Deconstructing Harry features many such inspired bits It also continues Allen s experimentation with offbeat camerawork and editing He s previously utilized a weaving hand held camera in Husbands and Wives and attempted Bergmanesque imagery in Interiors and September and in Harry he tries out the kind of jump cut editing popularized by Godard and Truffaut in such films as Breathless and Shoot The Piano Player Though the technique sometimes comes off as slightly self conscious it effectively points up Harry s fragmented chaotic world More off putting to some of Allen s fans may be the harshness of the language used by many of the characters although again it s perfectly in keeping with the rage most of these people are feeling In previous films Allen concentrated on the lighter side of divorce When Meryl Streep left him and wrote a tell all book about their failed marriage in Manhattan Allen played the idea for easy laughs But Harry s thinly veiled portraits of his friends and family do some real damage and almost inspire one of his subjects to kill him The humor cuts deeper and the laughter is sometimes tinged with a gasp of disbelief The brilliance of Deconstructing Harry lies in Allen s deft blending of its many tones sardonic sarcastic and sentimental

10066,Mother,,I like movies with Albert Brooks and I really like movies directed and written by Albert Brooks LOST IN AMERICA and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE are two of my favorite comedies His humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator You will rarely see any slapstick in an Albert Brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters The situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we can t Brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh Teenagers and Jim Carrey fans probably won t find an Albert Brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will Put simply Brooks comedy is intelligent MOTHER is Albert Brooks latest film and it does not disappoint Brooks plays John Henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce He makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably He then has dinner with his brother Jeff Rob Morrow a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life Jeff has a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother Beatrice Debbie Reynolds After dinner John witnesses a telephone conversation between Jeff and Beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is In comparison Beatrice always hints at a fault in John and his career every time she talks with him and John gives it right back to her At the end of one of their conversations where Beatrice has just picked apart John s life she says I love you and John replies with I know you think you do The thing is Beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading It s the kind that goes something like Yes dear I think you do that wonderfully BUT It seems as though nothing he does makes her happy There s always the big but John believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner He comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is A great experiment he calls it Brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction John has with his mother There s a scene where John has just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from Los Angeles to Sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment Beatrice asks Now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel She still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious In the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh She apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over When John points out the ice on the sherbet Beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze You ve named the ice asks John He s also surprised at the variety of items Beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as a twenty pound block of cheese The freezer was a good invention says John but it s not supposed to be used for everything That s why it s smaller than the refrigerator It s something most of us find strangely familiar Brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur For example in DEFENDING YOUR LIFE his and Meryl Streep s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion When they re finished and walk out Brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line And so the moral is if you have to fart go outside You don t know what the joke was because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but I must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context In this film Brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene I don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past John s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him His mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as John spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth Watching the character of Beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way On screen Brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character You get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world In a way he s very much like Yosarian of CATCH 22 expect with something of an attitude Casting Debbie Reynolds as Beatrice is perfect She assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character This only helps the audience to share the frustration John feels when dealing with her As his first choice Brooks originally wanted to lure Nancy Reagan out from her acting retirement to play Beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of Alzheimer s disease That may be just as well since Reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely Rob Morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as a mama s boy The only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes A solid connection is not really made between John s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother Additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this Beatrice You must think I m some kind of moron John No I think your someone who thinks I m a moron Beatrice Well it takes one to know one
10067,Turning The,1992,There s only one conceivable reason for watching The Turning and that s the same reason the film was released on video it features however briefly the unclad mammaries of Gillian Anderson Anderson otherwise known as Agent Dana Scully from TV s incredibly popular X Files did her early dues paying as a young actress in this goofy and depressing small town drama The Turning is based on a play called Home Fires Burning and it s obvious that the source material was meant to be presented on stage there are lots of scenes in which characters do nothing in particular besides sit around and talk Contrast this to other movies in which characters sit around and talk but do it in interesting locales or while doing something that doesn t look silly on stage like driving a car At any rate the story focuses on Clifford Harnish Michael Dolan a young man who returns to his home town of Pocahontas Virginia after an absence of four years Cliff has apparently been hanging out with Neo Nazis because his new mission in life is to rebuild his family while wearing swastikas Unfortunately his arrival coincides with the day his parents divorce is made final When he discovers his mother Martha Tess Harper sinking into an alcoholic depression and his father s new life with a different woman played by Karen Allen Cliff decides to take matters into his own hands Believing Glory Dad s new girlfriend to be the cause of the divorce Cliff decides to terrorize her into leaving his father Mark Raymond J Barry Cliff arrives at her house and slips in under false pretenses He warns her to stay away from Mark and tells her to show up at the lake the next morning where Mark and Cliff will be fishing to break off the relationship in Cliff s presence Instead Glory decides to expose Cliff in Mark s presence a decision no one in real life would make considering she had ample opportunity to talk to Mark before the fishing trip and Mark must then decide how to reconcile his love for his son with his repulsion for the psychotic hate monger that Cliff has become Lots of dramatic speeches result including one scene in which everybody seems to be holding everybody else at gun point with only one gun in the room But we can tell that our discerning readers really don t care about the psycho plot of this sick coming home drama they want to read about Gillian Anderson and what does or doesn t appear on screen The tape we screened was released by a small distributor named Leo Films and featured two previews one for a low budget sci fi John Woo rip off the other for what looked like the Australian version of Thelma and Louise The cover proudly declares that The Turning features Gillian Anderson of X Files fame complete with logo The tape s box art prominently features Ms Anderson to the exclusion of any other actors who were in the film and shows her unbuttoning the top button of her dress So what part does she play in the movie You may have noticed that she was not mentioned in our plot synopsis above This was apparently her first movie work as she is listed in the credits as And Introducing Gillian Anderson She plays April a waitress at a local diner We would estimate her screen time at less than ten minutes It turns out she was Cliff s girlfriend before he left town years before and in the only scene most of you reading this care about she and Cliff have sex on a kitchen floor The question then becomes is watching this movie worth a glimpse of Scully s secondary sexual characteristics Alas not by a long shot The movie was shot in a real town and the production looks very authentic which is why the pretentious and circuitous dialogue stands out as being so fake No one in this real situation would act like these characters or say the things these characters say And the ending is particularly bad it left us feeling unfulfilled If you must rent it do so but don t say we didn t warn you Note To dispel the notion that we are total sexist pigs we are actively looking for some embarrassing early work David Duchovny may have done Unfortunately it seems he did most of his early work wearing a dress and heels so finding anything that would be comparatively embarrassing is a real chore We would also point to our equal opportunity embarrassment of the cast of Mad About You Copyright 1997 Scott Hamilton Chris Holland For the html version of this review with screen captures please see Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews http members aol com stomptokyo
10068,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,1988,Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers Reviewed by Chris Holland Scott Hamilton By the time most movie franchises have made it to part four the life has been sucked out of the concept and all that s left is to rehash the same old scenes Most screenwriters and directors making these sequels feel little motivation to further the overall storyline or to break new ground for old characters For this reason fans of the original film tend to look down on all sequels and reject them as not as good as the first one once the end credits roll Halloween 4 has seen its share of criticism at the hands of horror fans but we feel that it deserves some credit for both maintaining the feel of the original film and for covering new territory with both new and old characters Because Halloween 3 did not take place within the Michael Myers storyline the producers of Halloween 4 gave it a subtitle that leaves no room for misinterpretation the inhuman killer with William Shatner s rubbery visage will indeed return to Haddonfield The Small Town That Just Doesn t Learn His favorite victim however is long gone Michael s sister Laurie Strode played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the first two films is nowhere to be found in part four Instead her daughter Jamie Lloyd so named in an obvious homage to Curtis is still residing in Haddonfield after the death of her parents Awww man you mean Laurie lived through all of that crap with Michael Myers only to die in a car accident or something Why anyone related to a psycho killer with a penchant for killing his own family would remain in the same town is beyond us but there it is Adopted by the Carruthers family Jamie lives an insecure life taunted by her classmates Your uncle s the boogeyman and unsure of her relationship with her foster sister Rachel Rachel for her part loves Jamie but is a teenager and is subject to the normal behavior problems incurred by being a teenager in a horror film We re talking about evil on two legs Meanwhile back on the funny farm Myers has escapedonce again this time by drilling his thumb into theskull of an ambulance attendant and slipping away in the resulting crash Doctor Loomis to the dismay of the asylum s director departs in pursuit of the killer because that s what he does Loomis the tireless Donald Pleasence is looking pretty haggard ten years later and his last run in with Michael didn t help any Loomis sacrificed himself in order to kill Michael by blowing up a hospital operating room Myers of course is headed back to Haddonfield to look up his niece and cut her throat Avon calling Up to this point the pacing and character development are fairly good Loomis has a roadside run in with Myers at a truck stop before making it to Haddonfield the inevitable sex scene is set up and the police are alerted just as Michael begins his killing spree To their credit the sherriff takes Loomis at his word and sends out an alert immediately There aren t many people in Haddonfield who can forget your name Doctor says Sherriff Meeker Especially the police This is startin to spook me Doc Unfortunately the movie fizzles soon thereafter After a brief chase by Michael Rachel and Jamie hole up in the sherriff s house which is a sensible thing to do but not very exciting There s a pointless romance subplot in which Rachel argues with the sherriff s daughter over a pointless male character who as we all can predict is destined to die before the film ends anyway and the sherriff leaves the house to reign in a posse that has started taking pot shots at the local populace in the name of hunting down Myers Just when you re thinking to yourself Where the hell is Michael Myers he arrives at the house and the killing begins again To be fair Halloween 4 has some genuine scares One nice touch set up early in the film is Jamie s choice of Halloween costume it s a clown costume similar to the one Michael wears at the beginning of the first film Also there s a bewildering and frightening scene in which multiple Michaels appear surrounding Loomis and the sherriff The cinematography is clean and the production values are high Nice little details like these make Halloween 4 more than the average underbudgeted slasher flick The best acting of course comes from Pleasence and surprisingly Danielle Harris as Jamie This little girl can scream pretty well The expected goofy teenager peformances are given by Ellie Cornell as Rachel and the other adolescent members of the cast although Cornell is clearly the best of the bunch You can t kill damnation mister It don t die like a man does Undoubtedly the most important thing about Halloween 4 is its ending which is probably the most creative and suprising ending ever filmed for the fourth film in a series It s a development at which you could probably guess but it s still darn creepy to see it on screen especially with the reactions of Doctor Loomis While not the equal of the first Halloween The Return of Michael Myers justifies its existence as a continuation of the Myers story It s not at all innovative in terms of action but it does further the plot and provides some satisfaction to those of us who are continually asking What happens next For the html version of this review including screen captures please visit Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews URL below
